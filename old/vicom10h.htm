Introduction:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>In the months of
March-July in 1844, in the magazine <i>Le Si&egrave;cle</i>, the
first portion of a story appeared, penned by the celebrated
playwright Alexandre Dumas.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was based, he claimed, on some
manuscripts he had found a year earlier in the Bibliotheque
Nationale while researching a history he planned to write on
Louis XIV.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They
chronicled the adventures of a young man named D'Artagnan who,
upon entering Paris, became almost immediately embroiled in court
intrigues, international politics, and ill-fated affairs between
royal lovers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Over the
next six years, readers would enjoy the adventures of this youth
and his three famous friends, Porthos, Athos, and Aramis, as
their exploits unraveled behind the scenes of some of the most
momentous events in French and even English history.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Eventually these
serialized adventures were published in novel form, and became
the three D'Artagnan Romances known today.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Here is a brief summary of the first
two novels:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><u>The Three Musketeers</u> (serialized
March - July, 1844): The year is 1625.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The young D'Artagnan arrives in
Paris at the tender age of 18, and almost immediately offends
three musketeers, Porthos, Aramis, and Athos.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Instead of dueling, the four are
attacked by five of the Cardinal's guards, and the courage of the
youth is made apparent during the battle.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The four become fast friends, and,
when asked by D'Artagnan's landlord to find his missing wife,
embark upon an adventure that takes them across both France and
England in order to thwart the plans of the Cardinal
Richelieu.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Along the way,
they encounter a beautiful young spy, named simply Milady, who
will stop at nothing to disgrace Queen Anne of Austria before her
husband, Louis XIII, and take her revenge upon the four
friends.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Twenty Years After</u> (serialized
January - August, 1845): The year is now 1648, twenty years since
the close of the last story.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis XIII has died, as has Cardinal
Richelieu, and while the crown of France may sit upon the head of
Anne of Austria as Regent for the young Louis XIV, the real power
resides with the Cardinal Mazarin, her secret husband.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan is now a lieutenant
of musketeers, and his three friends have retired to private
life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos turned out to
be a nobleman, the Comte de la F&egrave;re, and has retired to
his home with his son, Raoul de Bragelonne.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Aramis, whose real name is
D'Herblay, has followed his intention of shedding the musketeer's
cassock for the priest's robes, and Porthos has married a wealthy
woman, who left him her fortune upon her death.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But trouble is stirring in both
France and England.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Cromwell menaces the institution of royalty itself while marching
against Charles I, and at home the Fronde is threatening to tear
France apart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan
brings his friends out of retirement to save the threatened
English monarch, but Mordaunt, the son of Milady, who seeks to
avenge his mother's death at the musketeers' hands, thwarts their
valiant efforts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Undaunted, our heroes return to France just in time to help save
the young Louis XIV, quiet the Fronde, and tweak the nose of
Cardinal Mazarin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The third novel, <u>The
Vicomte de Bragelonne</u> (serialized October, 1847 - January,
1850), has enjoyed a strange history in its English
translation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It has been
split into three, four, or five volumes at various points in its
history.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The five-volume
edition generally does not give titles to the smaller portions,
but the others do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the
three-volume edition, the novels are entitled <u>The Vicomte de
Bragelonne</u>, <u>Louise de la Valli&egrave;re</u>, and <u>The
Man in the Iron Mask</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
For the purposes of this etext, I have chosen to split the novel
as the four-volume edition does, with these titles: <u>The
Vicomte de Bragelonne</u>, <u>Ten Years Later</u>, <u>Louise de
la Valli&egrave;re</u>, and <u>The Man in the Iron Mask</u>.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In this, the first of the four
etexts, the situation is thus:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It is now 1660, and although promised the
captaincy of the musketeers at the close of <u>Twenty Years
After</u>, D'Artagnan is still trailing his sword in the Louvre
as a lowly lieutenant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Louis XIV is well past the age where he should rule, but the
ailing Cardinal Mazarin refuses to relinquish the reins of
power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Meanwhile, Charles
II, a king without a country, travels Europe seeking aid from his
fellow monarchs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos
still resides at La F&egrave;re while his son, Raoul de
Bragelonne, has entered into the service in the household of M.
le Prince.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As for Raoul,
he has his eyes on an entirely different object than his father
&ndash; his childhood companion, Louise de la Valli&egrave;re,
with whom he is hopelessly in love.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos, now a baron, is off on some
mysterious mission along with Aramis, who is now the Bishop of
Vannes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Now begins the first chapter of the last of
the D'Artagnan Romances, <u>The Vicomte de Bragelonne</u>.<span

T</span>owards the middle of the month of May, in the year 1660,
at nine o'clock in the morning, when the sun, already high in the
heavens, was fast absorbing the dew from the ramparts of the
castle of Blois, a little cavalcade, composed of three men and
two pages, re-entered the city by the bridge, without producing
any other effect upon the passengers of the quay beyond a first
movement of the hand to the head, as a salute, and a second
movement of the tongue to express, in the purest French then
spoken in France: "There is Monsieur returning from
hunting."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And that was
all.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Whilst, however, the
horses were climbing the steep acclivity which leads from the
river to the castle, several shop-boys approached the last horse,
from whose saddle-bow a number of birds were suspended by the
beak.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> On seeing this, the
inquisitive youths manifested with rustic freedom their contempt
for such paltry sport, and, after a dissertation among themselves
upon the disadvantages of hawking, they returned to their
occupations; one only of the curious party, a stout, stubby,
cheerful lad, having demanded how it was that Monsieur, who, from
his great revenues, had it in his power to amuse himself so much
better, could be satisfied with such mean diversions.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do you not know," one
of the standers-by replied, "that Monsieur's principal amusement
is to weary himself?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The light-hearted boy
shrugged his shoulders with a gesture which said as clear as day:
"In that case I would rather be plain Jack than a prince."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And all resumed their
labors.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> In the meanwhile,
Monsieur continued his route with an air at once so melancholy
and so majestic, that he certainly would have attracted the
attention of spectators, if spectators there had been; but the
good citizens of Blois could not pardon Monsieur for having
chosen their gay city for an abode in which to indulge melancholy
at his ease, and as often as they caught a glimpse of the
illustrious <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ennuy&eacute;</i>, they stole away
gaping, or drew back their heads into the interior of their
dwellings, to escape the soporific influence of that long pale
face, of those watery eyes, and that languid address; so that the
worthy prince was almost certain to find the streets deserted
whenever he chanced to pass through them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Now, on the part of the
citizens of Blois this was a culpable piece of disrespect, for
Monsieur was, after the king - nay, even perhaps, before the king
- the greatest noble of the kingdom.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In fact, God, who had granted to
Louis XIV., then reigning, the honor of being son of Louis XIII.,
had granted to Monsieur the honor of being son of Henry IV.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was not then, or, at least,
it ought not to have been, a trifling source of pride for the
city of Blois, that Gaston of Orl&eacute;ans had chosen it as his
residence, and held his court in the ancient Castle of the
States.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> But it was the destiny
of this great prince to excite the attention and admiration of
the public in a very modified degree wherever he might be.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monsieur had fallen into this
situation by habit.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> It was not, perhaps,
this which gave him that air of listlessness.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monsieur had already been tolerably
busy in the course of his life.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A man cannot allow the heads of a
dozen of his best friends to be cut off without feeling a little
excitement; and as, since the accession of Mazarin to power, no
heads had been cut off, Monsieur's occupation was gone, and his
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>morale</i> suffered from
it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The life of the poor
prince was then very dull.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> After his little morning
hawking-party on the banks of the Beuvron, or in the woods of
Cheverny, Monsieur crossed the Loire, went to breakfast at
Chambord, with or without an appetite, and the city of Blois
heard no more of its sovereign lord and master till the next
hawking-day.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> So much for the ennui <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>extra muros</i>; of the ennui
of the interior we will give the reader an idea if he will with
us follow the cavalcade to the majestic porch of the Castle of
the States.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monsieur rode a little
steady-paced horse, equipped with a large saddle of red Flemish
velvet, with stirrups in the shape of buskins; the horse was of a
bay color; Monsieur's pourpoint of crimson velvet corresponded
with the cloak of the same shade and the horse's equipment, and
it was only by this red appearance of the whole that the prince
could be known from his two companions, the one dressed in
violet, the other in green.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He on the left, in violet, was his
equerry; he on the right, in green, was the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>grand veneur</i>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> One of the pages carried
two gerfalcons upon a perch, the other a hunting-horn, which he
blew with a careless note at twenty paces from the castle.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Every one about this listless
prince did what he had to listlessly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> At this signal, eight
guards, who were lounging in the sun in the square court, ran to
their halberts, and Monsieur made his solemn entry into the
castle.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> When he had disappeared
under the shades of the porch, three or four idlers, who had
followed the cavalcade to the castle, after pointing out the
suspended birds to each other, dispersed with comments upon what
they saw: and, when they were gone, the street, the palace, and
the court, all remained deserted alike.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monsieur dismounted
without speaking a word, went straight to his apartments, where
his valet changed his dress, and as Madame had not yet sent
orders respecting breakfast, Monsieur stretched himself upon a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>chaise longue</i>, and was
soon as fast asleep as if it had been eleven o'clock at
night.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The eight guards, who
concluded their service for the day was over, laid themselves
down very comfortably in the sun upon some stone benches; the
grooms disappeared with their horses into the stables, and, with
the exception of a few joyous birds, startling each other with
their sharp chirping in the tufted shrubberies, it might have
been thought that the whole castle was as soundly asleep as
Monsieur was.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> All at once, in the
midst of this delicious silence, there resounded a clear ringing
laugh, which caused several of the halberdiers in the enjoyment
of their <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>siesta</i> to open
at least one eye.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This burst of laughter
proceeded from a window of the castle, visited at this moment by
the sun, that embraced it in one of those large angles which the
profiles of the chimneys mark out upon the walls before
mid-day.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The little balcony of
wrought iron which advanced in front of this window was furnished
with a pot of red gilliflowers, another pot of primroses, and an
early rose-tree, the foliage of which, beautifully green, was
variegated with numerous red specks announcing future roses.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> In the chamber lighted
by this window, was a square table, covered with an old
large-flowered Haarlem tapestry; in the center of this table was
a long-necked stone bottle, in which were irises and lilies of
the valley; at each end of this table was a young girl.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The position of these
two young people was singular; they might have been taken for two
boarders escaped from a convent.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> One of them, with both elbows on the
table, and a pen in her hand, was tracing characters upon a sheet
of fine Dutch paper; the other, kneeling upon a chair, which
allowed her to advance her head and bust over the back of it to
the middle of the table, was watching her companion as she wrote,
or rather hesitated to write.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Thence the thousand
cries, the thousand railleries, the thousand laughs, one of
which, more brilliant than the rest, had startled the birds in
the gardens, and disturbed the slumbers of Monsieur's guards.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> We are taking portraits
now; we shall be allowed, therefore, we hope, to sketch the two
last of this chapter.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The one who was leaning
in the chair - that is to say, the joyous, laughing one - was a
beautiful girl of from eighteen to twenty, with brown complexion
and brown hair, splendid, from eyes which sparkled beneath
strongly-marked brows, and particularly from her teeth, which
seemed to shine like pearls between her red coral lips.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Her every movement seemed the
accent of a sunny nature; she did not walk - she bounded.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The other, she who was
writing, looked at her turbulent companion with an eye as limpid,
as pure, and as blue as the azure of the day.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Her hair, of a shaded fairness,
arranged with exquisite taste, fell in silky curls over her
lovely mantling cheeks; she passed across the paper a delicate
hand, whose thinness announced her extreme youth.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At each burst of laughter that
proceeded from her friend, she raised, as if annoyed, her white
shoulders in a poetical and mild manner, but they were wanting in
that richfulness of mold that was likewise to be wished in her
arms and hands.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Montalais!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Montalais!" said she at length, in a
voice soft and caressing as a melody, "you laugh too loud - you
laugh like a man!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You
will not only draw the attention of messieurs the guards, but you
will not hear Madame's bell when Madame rings."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This admonition neither
made the young girl called Montalais cease to laugh nor
gesticulate. She only replied: "Louise, you do not speak as you
think, my dear; you know that messieurs the guards, as you call
them, have only just commenced their sleep, and that a cannon
would not waken them; you know that Madame's bell can be heard at
the bridge of Blois, and that consequently I shall hear it when
my services are required by Madame.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What annoys you, my child, is that I
laugh while you are writing; and what you are afraid of is that
Madame de Saint-R&eacute;my, your mother, should come up here, as
she does sometimes when we laugh too loud, that she should
surprise us, and that she should see that enormous sheet of paper
upon which, in a quarter of an hour, you have only traced the
words <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Monsieur
Raoul</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now, you are
right, my dear Louise, because after these words, 'Monsieur
Raoul', others may be put so significant and incendiary as to
cause Madame Saint-R&eacute;my to burst out into fire and flames!
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hein!</i> is not that true
now? - say."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And Montalais redoubled
her laughter and noisy provocations.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The fair girl at length
became quite angry; she tore the sheet of paper on which, in
fact, the words "Monsieur Raoul" were written in good characters;
and crushing the paper in her trembling hands, she threw it out
of the window.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "There! there!" said
Mademoiselle de Montalais; "there is our little lamb, our gentle
dove, angry! Don't be afraid, Louise - Madame de
Saint-R&eacute;my will not come; and if she should, you know I
have a quick ear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Besides, what can be more permissible than to write to an old
friend of twelve years' standing, particularly when the letter
begins with the words 'Monsieur Raoul'?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is all very well - I
will not write to him at all," said the young girl.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah, ah! in good sooth,
Montalais is properly punished," cried the jeering brunette,
still laughing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Come,
come! let us try another sheet of paper, and finish our dispatch
off-hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Good! there is
the bell ringing now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> By
my faith, so much the worse!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame must wait, or else do without
her first maid of honor this morning."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> A bell, in fact, did
ring; it announced that Madame had finished her toilette, and
waited for Monsieur to give her his hand, and conduct her from
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>salon</i> to the
refectory.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This formality being
accomplished with great ceremony, the husband and wife
breakfasted, and then separated till the hour of dinner,
invariably fixed at two o'clock.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The sound of this bell
caused a door to be opened in the offices on the left hand of the
court, from which filed two <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ma&icirc;tres d'h&ocirc;tel</i>
followed by eight scullions bearing a kind of hand-barrow loaded
with dishes under silver covers.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> One of the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ma&icirc;tres d'h&ocirc;tel</i>, the
first in rank, touched one of the guards, who was snoring on his
bench, slightly with his wand; he even carried his kindness so
far as to place the halbert which stood against the wall in the
hands of the man stupid with sleep, after which the soldier,
without explanation, escorted the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>viande</i> of Monsieur to the
refectory, preceded by a page and the two <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ma&icirc;tres d'h&ocirc;tel</i>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Wherever the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>viande</i> passed, the soldiers
ported arms.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Mademoiselle de
Montalais and her companion had watched from their window the
details of this ceremony, to which, by the bye, they must have
been pretty well accustomed.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But they did not look so much from
curiosity as to be assured they should not be disturbed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> So, guards, scullions, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>ma&icirc;tres
d'h&ocirc;tel</i>, and pages having passed, they resumed their
places at the table; and the sun, which, through the
window-frame, had for an instant fallen upon those two charming
countenances, now only shed its light upon the gilliflowers,
primroses, and rose-tree.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Bah!" said Mademoiselle
de Montalais, taking her place again; "Madame will breakfast very
well without me!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Montalais, you will be punished!"
replied the other girl, sitting down quietly in hers.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Punished, indeed! -
that is to say, deprived of a ride!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That is just the way in which I wish
to be punished.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To go out
in the grand coach, perched upon a doorstep; to turn to the left,
twist round to the right, over roads full of ruts, where we
cannot exceed a league in two hours; and then to come back
straight towards the wing of the castle in which is the window of
Mary de Medici, so that Madame never fails to say: 'Could one
believe it possible that Mary de Medici should have escaped from
that window - forty-seven feet high?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The mother of two princes and three
princesses!'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If you call
that relaxation, Louise, all I ask is to be punished every day;
particularly when my punishment is to remain with you and write
such interesting letters as we write!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Montalais!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Montalais! there are duties to be
performed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You talk of them very
much at your ease, dear child! - you, who are left quite free
amidst this tedious court.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You are the only person that reaps
the advantages of them without incurring the trouble, - you, who
are really more one of Madame's maids of honor than I am, because
Madame makes her affection for your father-in-law glance off upon
you; so that you enter this dull house as the birds fly into
yonder court, inhaling the air, pecking the flowers, picking up
the grain, without having the least service to perform, or the
least annoyance to undergo.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And you talk to me of duties to be
performed!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In sooth, my
pretty idler, what are your own proper duties, unless to write to
the handsome Raoul?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And
even that you don't do; so that it looks to me as if you likewise
were rather negligent of your duties!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louise assumed a serious
air, leant her chin upon her hand, and, in a tone full of candid
remonstrance, "And do you reproach me with my good fortune?" said
she.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Can you have the
heart to do it?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You have
a future; you will belong to the court; the king, if he should
marry, will require Monsieur to be near his person; you will see
splendid <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>f&ecirc;tes</i>,
you will see the king, who they say is so handsome, so
agreeable!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ay, and still more, I
shall see Raoul, who attends upon M. le Prince," added Montalais,
maliciously.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Poor Raoul!" sighed
Louise.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Now is the time to
write to him, my pretty dear!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Come, begin again, with that famous
'Monsieur Raoul' which figures at the top of the poor torn
sheet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> She then held the pen
toward her, and with a charming smile encouraged her hand, which
quickly traced the words she named.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What next?" asked the
younger of the two girls.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why, now write what you
think, Louise," replied Montalais.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Are you quite sure I
think of anything?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You think of somebody,
and that amounts to the same thing, or rather even more."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do you think so,
Montalais?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Louise, Louise, your
blue eyes are as deep as the sea I saw at Boulogne last
year!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No, no, I mistake -
the sea is perfidious: your eyes are as deep as the azure yonder
- look! - over our heads!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, since you can
read so well in my eyes, tell me what I am thinking about,
Montalais."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In the first place, you
don't think, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Monsieur

dear Raoul</i>."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Never blush for such a
trifle as that!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> 'My dear
Raoul,' we will say - 'You implore me to write you at Paris,
where you are detained by your attendance on M. le Prince. As you
must be very dull there, to seek for amusement in the remembrance
of a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>provinciale</i> -
'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louise rose up
suddenly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "No,
Montalais," said she, with a smile; "I don't think a word of
that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Look, this is what
I think;" and she seized the pen boldly, and traced, with a firm
hand, the following words:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I should have been very
unhappy if your entreaties to obtain a remembrance of me had been
less warm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Everything
here reminds me of our early days, which so quickly passed away,
which so delightfully flew by, that no others will ever replace
the charm of them in my heart."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Montalais, who watched
the flying pen, and read, the wrong way upwards, as fast as her
friend wrote, here interrupted by clapping her hands.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Capital!" cried she; "there is
frankness - there is heart - there is style!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Show these Parisians, my dear, that
Blois is the city for fine language!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He knows very well that
Blois was a Paradise to me," replied the girl.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is exactly what
you mean to say; and you speak like an angel."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I will finish,
Montalais," and she continued as follows: "You often think of me,
you say, Monsieur Raoul: I thank you; but that does not surprise
me, when I recollect how often our hearts have beaten close to
each other."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! oh!" said
Montalais.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Beware, my
lamb!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You are scattering
your wool, and there are wolves about."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louise was about to
reply, when the gallop of a horse resounded under the porch of
the castle.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What is that?" said
Montalais, approaching the window.<span style=

faith!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! - Raoul!" exclaimed
Louise, who had made the same movement as her friend, and,
becoming pale as death, sunk back beside her unfinished
letter.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Now, he is a clever
lover, upon my word!" cried Montalais; "he arrives just at the

M</span>ademoiselle de Montalais was right; the young cavalier
was goodly to look upon.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> He was a young man of
from twenty-four to twenty-five years of age, tall and slender,
wearing gracefully the picturesque military costume of the
period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His large boots
contained a foot which Mademoiselle de Montalais might not have
disowned if she had been transformed into a man.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> With one of his delicate but nervous
hands he checked his horse in the middle of the court, and with
the other raised his hat, whose long plumes shaded his at once
serious and ingenuous countenance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The guards, roused by
the steps of the horse, awoke, and were on foot in a minute.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The young man waited till one
of them was close to his saddle-bow: then, stooping towards him,
in a clear, distinct voice, which was perfectly audible at the
window where the two girls were concealed, "A message for his
royal highness," he said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah, ah!" cried the
soldier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Officer, a
messenger!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> But this brave guard
knew very well that no officer would appear, seeing that the only
one who could have appeared dwelt at the other side of the
castle, in an apartment looking into the gardens.<span style=

monsieur, is on his rounds; but, in his absence, M. de

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "M. de

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why, yes; but request
him, if you please, that my visit be announced to his royal
highness as soon as possible."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It appears to be
pressing," said the guard, as if speaking to himself, but really
in the hope of obtaining an answer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The messenger made an
affirmative sign with his head.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In that case," said the
guard, "I will go and seek the <i style=

myself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The young man, in the

remarks upon the fine horse the cavalier rode, the soldier
returned.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The soldier made a
profound bow, and, as if the name of the conqueror of Rocroi and

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> As soon as he had
disappeared in the interior of the palace, the window of the

welcomed the newcomer with the proverbial politeness of the
country; some of them were acquainted with Raoul, and all knew
that he came from Paris.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
It might be said that his arrival for a moment suspended the
service.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In fact, a page,
who was pouring out wine for his royal highness, on hearing the
jingling of spurs in the next chamber, turned round like a child,
without perceiving that he was continuing to pour out, not into
the glass, but upon the tablecloth.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Madame, who was not so
preoccupied as her glorious spouse was, remarked this distraction
of the page.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well?" exclaimed
she.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well!" repeated
Monsieur; "what is going on then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> M. de Saint-R&eacute;my,
who had just introduced his head through the doorway, took
advantage of the moment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why am I to be
disturbed?" said Gaston, helping himself to a thick slice of one
of the largest salmon that had ever ascended the Loire to be
captured between Paimb&oelig;uf and Saint-Nazaire.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "There is a messenger
from Paris.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh! but after
monseigneur has breakfasted will do; there is plenty of
time."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "From Paris!" cried the
prince, letting his fork fall.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "A messenger from Paris, do you
say?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And on whose part
does this messenger come?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "On the part of M. le
Prince," said the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>
promptly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Every one knows that the
Prince de Cond&eacute; was so called.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A messenger from M. le
Prince!" said Gaston, with an inquietude that escaped none of the
assistants, and consequently redoubled the general curiosity.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monsieur, perhaps,
fancied himself brought back again to the happy times when the
opening of a door gave him an emotion, in which every letter
might contain a state secret, - in which every message was
connected with a dark and complicated intrigue.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Perhaps, likewise, that great name
of M. le Prince expanded itself, beneath the roofs of Blois, to
the proportions of a phantom.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monsieur pushed away his
plate.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Shall I tell the envoy
to wait?" asked M. de Saint-R&eacute;my.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> A glance from Madame
emboldened Gaston, who replied: "No, no! let him come in at once,
on the contrary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>A propos</i>, who is he?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A gentleman of this
country, M. le Vicomte de Bragelonne."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah, very well!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Introduce him,
Saint-R&eacute;my - introduce him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And when he had let fall
these words, with his accustomed gravity, Monsieur turned his
eyes, in a certain manner, upon the people of his suite, so that
all, pages, officers, and equerries, quitted the service, knives
and goblets, and made towards the second chamber door a retreat
as rapid as it was disorderly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This little army had
dispersed in two files when Raoul de Bragelonne, preceded by M.
de Saint-R&eacute;my, entered the refectory.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The short interval of
solitude which this retreat had left him, permitted Monsieur the
time to assume a diplomatic countenance.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He did not turn round, but waited
till the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>ma&icirc;tre
d'h&ocirc;tel</i> should bring the messenger face to face with
him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul stopped even with
the lower end of the table, so as to be exactly between Monsieur
and Madame.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> From this
place he made a profound bow to Monsieur, and a very humble one
to Madame; then, drawing himself up into military <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>pose</i>, he waited for Monsieur to
address him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> On his part the prince
waited till the doors were hermetically closed; he would not turn
round to ascertain the fact, as that would have been derogatory
to his dignity, but he listened with all his ears for the noise
of the lock, which would promise him at least an appearance of
secrecy.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The doors being closed,
Monsieur raised his eyes towards the vicomte, and said, "It
appears that you come from Paris, monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "This minute,
monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "How is the king?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "His majesty is in
perfect health, monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And my
sister-in-law?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Her majesty the
queen-mother still suffers from the complaint in her chest, but
for the last month she has been rather better."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Somebody told me you
came on the part of M. le Prince.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They must have been mistaken,
surely?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, monseigneur; M. le
Prince has charged me to convey this letter to your royal
highness, and I am to wait for an answer to it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul had been a little
annoyed by this cold and cautious reception, and his voice
insensibly sank to a low key.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The prince forgot that
he was the cause of this apparent mystery, and his fears
returned.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> He received the letter
from the Prince de Cond&eacute; with a haggard look, unsealed it
as he would have unsealed a suspicious packet, and in order to
read it so that no one should remark the effects of it upon his
countenance, he turned round.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Madame followed, with an
anxiety almost equal to that of the prince, every maneuver of her
august husband.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul, impassible, and a
little disengaged by the attention of his hosts, looked from his
place through the open window at the gardens and the statues
which peopled them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well!" cried Monsieur,
all at once, with a cheerful smile; "here is an agreeable
surprise, and a charming letter from M. le Prince.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Look, Madame!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The table was too large
to allow the arm of the prince to reach the hand of Madame; Raoul
sprang forward to be their intermediary, and did it with so good
a grace as to procure a flattering acknowledgement from the
princess.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You know the contents
of this letter, no doubt?" said Gaston to Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, monseigneur; M. le
Prince at first gave me the message verbally, but upon reflection
his highness took up his pen."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is beautiful
writing," said Madame, "but I cannot read it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Will you read it to
Madame, M. de Bragelonne?" said the duke.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes; read it, if you
please, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul began to read,
Monsieur giving again all his attention.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The letter was conceived in these
terms:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "MONSEIGNEUR - The king
is about to set out for the frontiers.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You are aware the marriage of his
majesty is concluded upon.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king has done me the honor to
appoint me his <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mar&eacute;chal-des-logis</i> for
this journey, and as I knew with what joy his majesty would pass
a day at Blois, I venture to ask your royal highness's permission
to mark the house you inhabit as our quarters.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If, however, the suddenness of this
request should create to your royal highness any embarrassment, I
entreat you to say so by the messenger I send, a gentleman of my
suite, M. le Vicomte de Bragelonne.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> My itinerary will depend on your
royal highness's determination, and instead of passing through
Blois, we shall come through Vend&ocirc;me or Romorantin.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I venture to hope that your
royal highness will be pleased with my arrangement, it being the
expression of my boundless desire to make myself agreeable to
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Nothing can be more
gracious toward us," said Madame, who had more than once
consulted the looks of her husband during the reading of the
letter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "The king here!"
exclaimed she, in a rather louder tone than would have been
necessary to preserve secrecy.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur," said his
royal highness in his turn, "you will offer my thanks to M. de
Cond&eacute;, and express to him my gratitude for the honor he
has done me."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Raoul
bowed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "On what day will his
majesty arrive?" continued the prince.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The king, monseigneur,
will in all probability arrive this evening."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But how, then, could he
have known my reply if it had been in the negative?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I was desired,
monseigneur, to return in all haste to Beaugency, to give
counter-orders to the courier, who was himself to go back
immediately with counter-orders to M. le Prince."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "His majesty is at
Orl&eacute;ans, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Much nearer,
monseigneur; his majesty must by this time have arrived at
Meung."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Does the court
accompany him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "<i style=

after M. le Cardinal."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "His eminence appears to
enjoy good health, monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "His nieces accompany
him, no doubt?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, monseigneur; his
eminence has ordered the Mesdemoiselles de Mancini to set out for
Brouage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They will follow
the left bank of the Loire, while the court will come by the
right.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mademoiselle Mary de Mancini quit
the court in that manner?" asked Monsieur, his reserve beginning
to diminish.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Mademoiselle Mary de
Mancini in particular," replied Raoul discreetly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> A fugitive smile, an
imperceptible vestige of his ancient spirit of intrigue, shot
across the pale face of the prince.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Thanks, M. de
Bragelonne," then said Monsieur.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "You would, perhaps, not be willing
to carry M. le Prince the commission with which I would charge
you, and that is, that his messenger has been very agreeable to
me; but I will tell him so myself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul bowed his thanks
to Monsieur for the honor he had done him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monsieur made a sign to
Madame, who struck a bell which was placed at her right hand; M.
de Saint-R&eacute;my entered, and the room was soon filled with
people.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Messieurs," said the
prince, "his majesty is about to pay me the honor of passing a
day at Blois; I depend on the king, my nephew, not having to
repent of the favor he does my house."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Vive le Roi!</i>" cried all the
officers of the household with frantic enthusiasm, and M. de
Saint-R&eacute;my louder than the rest.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Gaston hung down his
head with evident chagrin.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had all his life been obliged to
hear, or rather to undergo, this cry of "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Vive le Roi!</i>" which passed over
him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> For a long time,
being unaccustomed to hear it, his ear had had rest, and now a
younger, more vivacious, and more brilliant royalty rose up
before him, like a new and more painful provocation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Madame perfectly
understood the sufferings of that timid, gloomy heart; she rose
from the table, Monsieur imitated her mechanically, and all the
domestics, with a buzzing like that of several bee-hives,
surrounded Raoul for the purpose of questioning him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Madame saw this
movement, and called M. de Saint-R&eacute;my.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "This is not the time
for gossiping, but working," said she, with the tone of an angry
housekeeper.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> M. de Saint-R&eacute;my
hastened to break the circle formed by the officers round Raoul,
so that the latter was able to gain the ante-chamber.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Care will be taken of
that gentleman, I hope," added Madame, addressing M. de
Saint-R&eacute;my.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The worthy man
immediately hastened after Raoul.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Madame desires refreshments to be
offered to you," said he; "and there is, besides, a lodging for
you in the castle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Thanks, M. de
Saint-R&eacute;my," replied Raoul; "but you know how anxious I
must be to pay my duty to M. le Comte, my father."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is true, that is
true, Monsieur Raoul; present him, at the same time, my humble
respects, if you please."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul thus once more got
rid of the old gentleman, and pursued his way.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As he was passing under the porch,
leading his horse by the bridle, a soft voice called him from the
depths of an obscure path.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur Raoul!" said
the voice.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The young man turned
round, surprised, and saw a dark complexioned girl, who, with a
finger on her lip, held out her other hand to him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This young lady was an utter
stranger.</p>

R</span>aoul made one step towards the girl who thus called
him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But my horse, madame?"
said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! you are terribly
embarrassed!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Go yonder
way - there is a shed in the outer court: fasten your horse, and
return quickly!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I obey, madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul was not four
minutes in performing what he had been directed to do; he
returned to the little door, where, in the gloom, he found his
mysterious conductress waiting for<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> him, on the first steps of a winding
staircase.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Are you brave enough to
follow me, monsieur knight errant?" asked the girl, laughing at
the momentary hesitation Raoul had manifested.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The latter replied by
springing up the dark staircase after her.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They thus climbed up three stories,
he behind her, touching with his hands, when he felt for the
banister, a silk dress which rubbed against each side of the
staircase.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At every false
step made by Raoul, his conductress cried, "Hush!" and held out
to him a soft perfumed hand.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "One would mount thus to
the belfry of the castle without being conscious of fatigue,"
said Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "All of which means,
monsieur, that you are very much perplexed, very tired, and very
uneasy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But be of good
cheer, monsieur; here we are, at our destination."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The girl threw open a
door, which immediately, without any transition, filled with a
flood of light the landing of the staircase, at the top of which
Raoul appeared, holding fast by the balustrade.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The girl continued to
walk on - he followed her; she entered a chamber - he did the
same.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> As soon as he was fairly
in the net he heard a loud cry, and, turning round, saw at two
paces from him, with her hands clasped and her eyes closed, that
beautiful fair girl with blue eyes and white shoulders, who,
recognizing him, called him Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> He saw her, and divined
at once so much love and so much joy in the expression of her
countenance, the he sank on his knees in the middle of the
chamber, murmuring, on his part, the name of Louise.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Montalais! - Montalais!" she sighed,
"it is very wicked to deceive me so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Who, I?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have deceived you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

would go down to inquire the news, and you have brought up
monsieur!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, I was obliged to
do so - how else could he have received the letter you wrote
him?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And she pointed
with her finger to the letter which was still upon the table.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul made a step to
take it; Louise, more rapid, although she had sprung forward with
a sufficiently remarkable physical hesitation, reached out her
hand to stop him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Raoul
came in contact with that trembling hand, took it within his own,
and carried it so respectfully to his lips, that he might have
been said to have deposited a sigh upon it rather than a
kiss.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> In the meantime,
Mademoiselle de Montalais had taken the letter, folded it
carefully, as women do, in three folds, and slipped it into her
bosom.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Don't be afraid,
Louise," said she; "monsieur will no more venture to take it
hence than the defunct king Louis XIII. ventured to take billets
from the corsage of Mademoiselle de Hautefort."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul blushed at seeing
the smile of the two girls; and he did not remark that the hand
of Louise remained in his.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "There!" said Montalais,
"you have pardoned me, Louise, for having brought monsieur to
you; and you, monsieur, bear me no malice for having followed me
to see mademoiselle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now,
then, peace being made, let us chat like old friends.<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur le Vicomte,"
said Louise, with her quiet grace and ingenuous smile, "I have
the honor to present to you Mademoiselle Aure de Montalais, maid
of honor to her royal highness MADAME, and moreover my friend -
my excellent friend."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul bowed
ceremoniously.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

he - "will you not present me also to mademoiselle?"</p>

knows all!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

expression made Montalais laugh and Raoul sigh with happiness,
for he interpreted it thus: "<i style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The ceremonies being

tell us quickly the news you bring flying thus."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Mademoiselle, it is no
longer a secret; the king, on his way to Poitiers, will stop at
Blois, to visit his royal highness."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The king here!"
exclaimed Montalais, clapping her hands.<span style=

I!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Louise, innocently.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

about to change, and we shall be ridiculous, even for Blois; for
close to us will be seen the fashions from Paris, and they will
perceive that we are in the fashion of Blois!<span style=

despair!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Montalais, philosophically.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "They would be very

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But as the king, it is
said, cannot do without Mademoiselle Mary?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

must do without her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M.

Brouage."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Bah! nobody can hear
me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I say that old
Mazarino Mazarini is a hypocrite, who burns impatiently to make
his niece Queen of France."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That cannot be,
mademoiselle, since M. le Cardinal, on the contrary, had brought
about the marriage of his majesty with the Infanta Maria
Theresa."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Montalais looked Raoul
full in the face, and said, "And do you Parisians believe in
these tales?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well! we are
a little more knowing than you, at Blois."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Mademoiselle, if the
king goes beyond Poitiers and sets out for Spain; if the articles
of the marriage contract are agreed upon by Don Luis de Haro and
his eminence, you must plainly perceive that it is not child's
play."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "All very fine! but the
king is king, I suppose?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No doubt, mademoiselle;
but the cardinal is the cardinal."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The king is not a man,
then!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he does not
love Mary Mancini?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He adores her."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, he will marry her
then.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We shall have war
with Spain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M. Mazarin
will spend a few of the millions he has put away; our gentlemen
will perform prodigies of valor in their encounters with the
proud Castilians, and many of them will return crowned with
laurels, to be recrowned by us with myrtles.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now, that is my view of
politics."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Montalais, you are
wild!" said Louise, "and every exaggeration attracts you as light
does a moth."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Louise, you are so
extremely reasonable, that you will never know how to love."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh!" said Louise, in a
tone of tender reproach, "don't you see, Montalais?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The queen-mother desires to marry
her son to the Infanta; would you wish him to disobey his
mother?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Is it for a royal
heart like his to set such a bad example?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When parents forbid love, love must
be banished."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And Louise sighed: Raoul
cast down his eyes, with an expression of constraint.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Montalais, on her part, laughed
aloud.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, I have no
parents!" said she.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are acquainted,
without doubt, with the state of health of M. le Comte de la
F&egrave;re?" said Louise, after breathing that sigh which had
revealed so many griefs in its eloquent utterance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, mademoiselle,"
replied Raoul, "I have not let paid my respects to my father; I
was going to his house when Mademoiselle de Montalais so kindly
stopped me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I hope the
comte is well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You have
heard nothing to the contrary, have you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, M. Raoul - nothing,
thank God!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Here, for several
instants, ensued a silence, during which two spirits, which
followed the same idea, communicated perfectly, without even the
assistance of a single glance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, heavens!" exclaimed
Montalais in a fright; "there is somebody coming up."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Who can it be?" said
Louise, rising in great agitation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Mesdemoiselles, I
inconvenience you very much.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have, without doubt, been very
indiscreet," stammered Raoul, very ill at ease.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is a heavy step,"
said Louise.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! if it is only M.
Malicorne," added Montalais, "do not disturb yourselves."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louise and Raoul looked
at each other to inquire who M. Malicorne could be.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "There is no occasion to
mind him," continued Montalais; "he is not jealous."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But, mademoiselle -
"said Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, I understand.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well, he is discreet as I
am."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Good heavens!" cried
Louise, who had applied her ear to the door, which had been left
ajar; "it is my mother's step!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Madame de
Saint-R&eacute;my!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Where
shall I hide myself?" exclaimed Raoul, catching at the dress of
Montalais, who looked quite bewildered.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes," said she; "yes, I
know the clicking of those pattens!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is our excellent mother.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M. le Vicomte, what a pity it
is the window looks upon a stone pavement, and that fifty paces
below it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul glanced at the
balcony in despair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Louise seized his arm and held it tight.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, how silly I am!"
said Montalais; "have I not the robe-of-ceremony closet?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It looks as if it were made on
purpose."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> It was quite time to
act; Madame de Saint-R&eacute;my was coming up at a quicker pace
than usual.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She gained
the landing at the moment when Montalais, as in all scenes of
surprises, shut the closet by leaning with her back against the
door.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!" cried Madame de
Saint-R&eacute;my, "you are here, are you, Louise?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, madame," replied
she, more pale than if she had committed a great crime.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Pray be seated,
madame," said Montalais, offering her a chair, which she placed
so that the back was towards the closet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Thank you, Mademoiselle
Aure - thank you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Come,
my child, be quick."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

go, madame?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why, home, to be sure;
have you not to prepare your toilette?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What did you say?"
cried Montalais, hastening to affect surprise, so fearful was she
that Louise would in some way commit herself.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You don't know the
news, then?" said Madame de Saint-R&eacute;my.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What news, madame, is
it possible for two girls to learn up in this dove-cote?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

nobody?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Madame, you talk in
enigmas, and you torment us at a<span style=

terrified at seeing Louise become paler and paler, did not know
to what saint to put up her vows.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> At length she caught an
eloquent look of her companion's, one of those looks which would
convey intelligence to a brick wall.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louise directed her attention to a
hat - Raoul's unlucky hat, which was set out in all its feathery
splendor upon the table.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Montalais sprang towards
it, and, seizing it with her left hand, passed it behind her into
the right, concealing it as she was speaking.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well," said Madame de
Saint-R&eacute;my, "a courier has arrived, announcing the
approach of the king.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
There, mesdemoiselles; there is something to make you put on your
best looks."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Quick, quick!" cried
Montalais.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Follow Madame
your mother, Louise; and leave me to get ready my dress of
ceremony."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louise arose; her mother
took her by the hand, and led her out on to the landing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Come along," said she;
then adding in a low voice, "When I forbid you to come the
apartment of Montalais, why do you do so?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Madame, she is my

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

concealed while you were there?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I saw a man's hat, I
tell you - the hat of that fellow, that good-for-nothing!"</p>

Louise.</p>

'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Of that do-nothing
Malicorne!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A maid of

lost in the depths of the narrow staircase.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Montalais had not missed
a word of this conversation, which echo conveyed to her as if
through a tunnel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She
shrugged her shoulders on seeing Raoul, who had listened
likewise, issue from the closet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

she, "the victim of friendship!<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> She stopped on viewing
the tragic-comic face of Raoul, who was vexed at having, in one
day, surprised so many secrets.</p>

he; "how can we repay your kindness?"</p>

'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The reader will dispense
with a second description of that habitation: he, perhaps, has
been with us there before, and knows it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Only, since our last journey
thither, the walls had taken on a grayer tint, and the brick-work
assumed a more harmonious copper tone; the trees had grown, and
many that then only stretched their slender branches along the
tops of the hedges, now, bushy, strong, and luxuriant, cast
around, beneath boughs swollen with sap, great shadows of
blossoms or fruit for the benefit of the traveler.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul perceived, from a
distance, the two little turrets, the dove-cote in the elms, and
the flights of pigeons, which wheeled incessantly around that
brick cone, seemingly without power to quit it, like the sweet
memories which hover round a spirit at peace.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> As he approached, he
heard the noise of the pulleys which grated under the weight of
the heavy pails; he also fancied he heard the melancholy moaning
of the water which falls back again into the wells - a sad,
funereal, solemn sound, which strikes the ear of the child and
the poet - both dreamers - which the English call <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>splash</i>; Arabian poets <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>gasgachau</i>; and which we
Frenchmen, who would be poets, can only translate by a paraphrase
- <i style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>the noise of water
falling into water</i>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> It was more than a year
since Raoul had been to visit his father.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had passed the whole time in the
household of M. le Prince.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In fact, after all the commotions of
the Fronde, of the early period of which we formerly attempted to
give a sketch, Louis de Cond&eacute; had made a public, solemn
and frank reconciliation with the court.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> During all the time that the rupture
between the king and the prince had lasted, the prince, who had
long entertained a great regard for Bragelonne, had in vain
offered him advantages of the most dazzling kind for a young
man.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The Comte de la
F&egrave;re, still faithful to his principles of loyalty, and
royalty, one day developed before his son in the vaults of Saint
Denis, - the Comte de la F&egrave;re, in the name of his son, had
always declined them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Moreover, instead of following M. de Cond&eacute; in his
rebellion, the vicomte had followed M. de Turenne, fighting for
the king.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then when M. de
Turenne, in his turn, had appeared to abandon the royal cause, he
had quitted M. de Turenne, as he had quitted M. de
Cond&eacute;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It resulted
from this invariable line of conduct, that, as Cond&eacute; and
Turenne had never been conquerors of each other but under the
standard of the king, Raoul, however young, had ten victories
inscribed on his list of services, and not one defeat from which
his bravery or conscience had to suffer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul, therefore, had,
in compliance with the wish of his father, served obstinately and
passively the fortunes of Louis XIV., in spite of the
tergiversations which were endemic, and, it might be said,
inevitable, at that period.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> M. de Cond&eacute;; on
being restored to favor, had at once availed himself of all the
privileges of the amnesty to ask for many things back again which
had been granted to him before, and among others, Raoul.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M. de la F&egrave;re, with his
invariable good sense, had immediately sent him again to the
prince.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> A year, then, had passed
away since the separation of the father and son; a few letters
had softened, but not removed, the pain of absence.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We have seen that Raoul had left at
Blois another love in addition to filial love.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But let us do him this justice - if
it had not been for chance and Mademoiselle de Montalais, two
great temptations, Raoul, after delivering his message, would
have galloped off towards his father's house, turning his head
round, perhaps, but without stopping for a single instant, even
if Louise had held out her arms to him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> So the first part of the
journey was given by Raoul to regretting the past which he had
been forced to quit so quickly, that is to say, his lady-love;
and the other part to the friend he was about to join, so much
too slowly for his wishes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul found the
garden-gate open, and rode straight in, without regarding the
long arms, raised in anger, of an old man dressed in a jacket of
violet-colored wool, and a large cap of faded velvet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The old man, who was
weeding with his hands a bed of dwarf roses and marguerites, was
indignant at seeing a horse thus traversing his sanded and
nicely-raked walks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He
even ventured a vigorous "Humph!" which made the cavalier turn
round.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then there was a
change of scene; for no sooner had he caught sight of Raoul's
face, than the old man sprang up and set off in the direction of
the house, amidst interrupted growlings, which appeared to be
paroxysms of wild delight.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> When arrived at the
stables, Raoul gave his horse to a little lackey, and sprang up
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>perron</i> with an
ardor that would have delighted the heart of his father.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> He crossed the
ante-chamber, the dining-room, and the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>salon</i>, without meeting any one;
at length, on reaching the door of M. de la F&egrave;re's
apartment, he rapped impatiently, and entered almost without
waiting for the word "Enter!" which was vouchsafed him by a voice
at once sweet and serious.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The comte was seated at a table
covered with papers and books; he was still the noble, handsome
gentleman of former days, but time had given to this nobleness
and beauty a more solemn and distinct character.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A brow white and void of wrinkles,
beneath his long hair, now more white than black; an eye piercing
and mild, under the lids of a young man; his mustache, fine but
slightly grizzled, waved over lips of a pure and delicate model,
as if they had never been curled by mortal passions; a form
straight and supple; an irreproachable but thin hand - this was
what remained of the illustrious gentleman whom so many
illustrious mouths had praised under the name of Athos.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was engaged in correcting
the pages of a manuscript book, entirely filled by his own
hand.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul seized his father
by the shoulders, by the neck, as he could, and embraced him so
tenderly and so rapidly, that the comte had neither strength nor
time to disengage himself, or to overcome his paternal
emotions.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What! you here, Raoul -
you!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Is it possible?"
said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, monsieur, monsieur,
what joy to see you once again!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But you don't answer
me, vicomte.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Have you
leave of absence, or has some misfortune happened at Paris?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Thank God, monsieur,"
replied Raoul, calming himself by degrees, "nothing has happened
but what is fortunate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The king is going to be married, as I had the honor of informing
you in my last letter, and, on his way to Spain, he will pass
through Blois."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To pay a visit to
Monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, monsieur le
comte.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> So, fearing to
find him unprepared, or wishing to be particularly polite to him,
monsieur le prince sent me forward to have the lodgings
ready."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You have seen
Monsieur?" asked the comte, eagerly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I have had that
honor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "At the castle?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, monsieur," replied
Raoul, casting down his eyes, because, no doubt, he had felt
there was something more than curiosity in the comte's
inquiries.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah, indeed,
vicomte?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Accept my
compliments thereupon."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul bowed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But you have seen some
one else at Blois?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur, I saw her
royal highness, Madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That's very well: but
it is not Madame that I mean."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul colored deeply,
but made no reply.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You do not appear to
understand me, monsieur le vicomte," persisted M. de la
F&egrave;re, without accenting his words more strongly, but with
a rather severer look.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I understand you quite
plainly, monsieur," replied Raoul, "and if I hesitate a little in
my reply, you are well assured I am not seeking for a
falsehood."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, you cannot tell a
lie; and that makes me so astonished you should be so long in
saying yes or no."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I cannot answer you
without understanding you very well; and if I have understood
you, you will take my first words in ill part.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You will displeased, no doubt,
monsieur le comte, because I have seen - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Mademoiselle de la
Valli&egrave;re - have you not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It was of her you meant
to speak, I know very well, monsieur," said Raoul, with
inexpressible sweetness.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And I asked you if you
have seen her."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur, I was
ignorant, when I entered the castle, that Mademoiselle de la
Valli&egrave;re was there; it was only on my return, after I had
performed my mission, that chance brought us together.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have had the honor of paying
my respects to her."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But what do you call
the chance that led you into the presence of Mademoiselle de la
Valli&egrave;re?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Mademoiselle de
Montalais, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And who is Mademoiselle
de Montalais?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A young lady I did not
know before, whom I had never seen.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She is maid of honor to Madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur le vicomte, I
will push my interrogatory no further, and reproach myself with
having carried it so far.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
I had desired you to avoid Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re,
and not to see her without my permission.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh, I am quite sure you have told me
the truth, and that you took no measures to approach her.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Chance has done me this
injury; I do not accuse you of it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I will be content, then, with what I
formerly said to you concerning this young lady.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I do not reproach her with anything
- God is my witness! only it is not my intention or wish that you
should frequent her place of residence.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I beg you once more, my dear Raoul,
to understand that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> It was plain the limpid
eyes of Raoul were troubled at this speech.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Now, my friend," said
the comte, with his soft smile, and in his customary tone, "let
us talk of other matters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
You are returning, perhaps, to your duty?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, monsieur, I have no
duty for to-day, except the pleasure of remaining with you.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The prince kindly appointed me
no other: which was so much in accord with my wish."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Is the king well?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Perfectly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And monsieur le prince
also?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "As usual,
monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The comte forgot to
inquire after Mazarin; that was an old habit.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, Raoul, since you
are entirely mine, I will give up my whole day to you.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Embrace me - again,
again!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You are at home,
vicomte!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Ah, there is our
old Grimaud!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Come in,
Grimaud: monsieur le vicomte is desirous of embracing you
likewise."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The good old man did not
require to be twice told; he rushed in with open arms, Raoul
meeting him half-way.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Now, if you please, we
will go into the garden, Raoul.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I will show you the new lodging I
have had prepared for you during your leave of absence; and
whilst examining the last winter's plantations, and two
saddle-horses I have just acquired, you will give me all the news
of our friends in Paris."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The comte closed his
manuscript, took the young man's arm, and went out into the
gardens with him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Grimaud looked at Raoul
with a melancholy air as the young man passed out; observing that
his head nearly touched the <i style=

stroking his white <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>royale</i>, he slowly murmured:-</p>

W</span>hilst the Comte de la F&egrave;re with Raoul visits the
new buildings he has erected, and the new horses he has bought,
with the reader's permission we will lead him back to the city of
Blois, and make him a witness of the unaccustomed activity which
pervades that city.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> It was in the hotels
that the surprise of the news brought by Raoul was most sensibly
felt.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> In fact, the king and
the court at Blois, that is to say, a hundred horsemen, ten
carriages, two hundred horses, as many lackeys as masters - where
was this crowd to be housed?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Where were to be lodged all the
gentry of the neighborhood, who would gather in two or three
hours after the news had enlarged the circle of its report, like
the increasing circumferences produced by a stone thrown into a
placid lake?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Blois, as peaceful in
the morning, as we have seen, as the calmest lake in the world,
at the announcement of the royal arrival, was suddenly filled
with the tumult and buzzing of a swarm of bees.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> All the servants of the
castle, under the inspection of the officers, were sent into the
city in quest of provisions, and ten horsemen were dispatched to
the preserves of Chambord to seek for game, to the fisheries of
Beuvron for fish, and to the gardens of Cheverny for fruits and
flowers.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Precious tapestries, and
lusters with great gilt chains, were drawn from the cupboards; an
army of the poor were engaged in sweeping the courts and washing
the stone fronts, whilst their wives went in droves to the
meadows beyond the Loire, to gather green boughs and
field-flowers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The whole
city, not to be behind in this luxury of cleanliness, assumed its
best toilette with the help of brushes, brooms, and water.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The gutters of the upper
town, swollen by these continued ablutions, became rivers at the
bottom of the city, and the pavement, generally very muddy, it
must be allowed, took a clean face, and absolutely shone in the
friendly rays of the sun.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Next the music was to be
provided; drawers were emptied; the shop-keepers did a glorious
trade in wax, ribbons, and sword-knots; housekeepers laid in
stores of bread, meat, and spices.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Already numbers of the citizens
whose houses were furnished as if for a siege, having nothing
more to do, donned their festive clothes, and directed their
course towards the city gate, in order to be the first to signal
or see the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cort&eacute;ge</i>.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They knew very well that the king
would not arrive before night, perhaps not before the next
morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Yet what is
expectation but a kind of folly, and what is that folly but an
excess of hope?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> In the lower city, at
scarcely a hundred paces from the Castle of the States, between
the mall and the castle, in a sufficiently handsome street, then
called the Rue Vieille, and which must, in fact, have been very
old, stood a venerable edifice, with pointed gables, of squat but
large dimensions, ornamented with three windows looking into the
street on the first floor, with two in the second, and with a
little <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>&oelig;il de
b&oelig;uf</i> in the third.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> On the sides of this
triangle had recently been constructed a parallelogram of
considerable size, which encroached upon the street
remorselessly, according to the familiar uses of the building of
that period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The street
was narrowed by a quarter by it, but then the house was enlarged
by a half; and was not that a sufficient compensation?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Tradition said that this
house with the pointed gables was inhabited, in the time of Henry
III., by a councilor of state whom Queen Catherine came, some say
to visit, and others to strangle.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> However that may be, the good lady
must have stepped with a circumspect foot over the threshold of
this building.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> After the councilor had
died - whether by strangulation or naturally is of no consequence
- the house had been sold, then abandoned, and lastly isolated
from the other houses of the street.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Towards the middle of the reign of
Louis XIII. only, an Italian named Cropoli, escaped from the
kitchens of the Mar&eacute;chal d'Ancre, came and took possession
of this house.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There he
established a little hostelry, in which was fabricated a macaroni
so delicious that people came from miles round to fetch it or eat
it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> So famous had the house
become for it, that when Mary de Medici was a prisoner, as we
know, in the castle of Blois, she once sent for some.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> It was precisely on the
day she had escaped by the famous window.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The dish of macaroni was left upon
the table, only just tasted by the royal mouth.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This double favor, of a
strangulation and a macaroni, conferred upon the triangular
house, gave poor Cropoli a fancy to grace his hostelry with a
pompous title.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But his
quality of an Italian was no recommendation in these times, and
his small, well-concealed fortune forbade attracting too much
attention.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> When he found himself
about to die, which happened in 1643, just after the death of
Louis XIII., he called to him his son, a young cook of great
promise, and with tears in his eyes, he recommended him to
preserve carefully the secret of the macaroni, to Frenchify his
name, and at length, when the political horizon should be cleared
from the clouds which obscured it - this was practiced then as in
our day, to order of the nearest smith a handsome sign, upon
which a famous painter, whom he named, should design two queens'
portraits, with these words as a legend: "TO THE MEDICI."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The worthy Cropoli,
after these recommendations, had only sufficient time to point
out to his young successor a chimney, under the slab of which he
had hidden a thousand ten-franc pieces, and then expired.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Cropoli the younger,
like a man of good heart, supported the loss with resignation,
and the gain without insolence.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He began by accustoming the public
to sound the final <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>i</i> of
his name so little, that by the aid of general complaisance, he
was soon called nothing but M. Cropol&eacute;, which is quite a
French name.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He then
married, having had in his eye a little French girl, from whose
parents he extorted a reasonable dowry by showing them what there
was beneath the slab of the chimney.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> These two points
accomplished, he went in search of the painter who was to paint
the sign; and he was soon found.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was an old Italian, a rival of
the Raphaels and the Caracci, but an unfortunate rival.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He said he was of the Venetian
school, doubtless from his fondness for color.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His works, of which he had never
sold one, attracted the eye at a distance of a hundred paces; but
they so formidably displeased the citizens, that he had finished
by painting no more.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> He boasted of having
painted a bath-room for Madame la Mar&eacute;chale d'Ancre, and
mourned over this chamber having been burnt at the time of the
mar&eacute;chal's disaster.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Cropoli, in his
character of a compatriot, was indulgent towards Pittrino, which
was the name of the artist.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Perhaps he had seen the famous
pictures of the bath-room.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Be this as it may, he held in such
esteem, we may say in such friendship, the famous Pittrino, that
he took him in his own house.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Pittrino, grateful, and
fed with macaroni, set about propagating the reputation of this
national dish, and from the time of its founder, he had rendered,
with his indefatigable tongue, signal services to the house of
Cropoli.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> As he grew old he
attached himself to the son as he had done to the father, and by
degrees became a kind of over-looker of a house in which his
remarkable integrity, his acknowledged sobriety, and a thousand
other virtues useless to enumerate, gave him an eternal place by
the fireside, with a right of inspection over the domestics.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Besides this, it was he who
tasted the macaroni, to maintain the pure flavor of the ancient
tradition; and it must be allowed that he never permitted a grain
of pepper too much, or an atom of parmesan too little.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His joy was at its height on
that day when called upon to share the secret of Cropoli the
younger, and to paint the famous sign.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> He was seen at once
rummaging with ardor in an old box, in which he found some
brushes, a little gnawed by the rats, but still passable; some
linseed-oil in a bottle, and a palette which had formerly
belonged to Bronzino, that <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>dieu de la pittoure</i>, as the
ultramontane artist, in his ever young enthusiasm, always called
him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Pittrino was puffed up
with all the joy of a rehabilitation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> He did as Raphael had
done- he changed his style, and painted, in the fashion of
Albani, two goddesses rather than two queens.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> These illustrious ladies appeared so
lovely on the sign, - they presented to the astonished eyes such
an assemblage of lilies and roses, the enchanting result of the
changes of style in Pittrino - they assumed the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>poses</i> of sirens so
Anacreontically - that the principal <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>&eacute;chevin</i>, when admitted to
view this capital piece in the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>salle</i> of Cropol&eacute;, at once
declared that these ladies were too handsome, of too animated a
beauty, to figure as a sign in the eyes of passers-by.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> To Pittrino he added,
"His royal highness, Monsieur, who often comes into our city,
will not be much pleased to see his illustrious mother so
slightly clothed, and he will send you to the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>oubliettes</i> of the state; for,
remember, the heart of that glorious prince is not always
tender.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You must efface
either the two sirens or the legend, without which I forbid the
exhibition of the sign.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I
say this for your sake, Master Cropol&eacute;, as well for yours,
Signor Pittrino."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> What answer could be
made to this?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was
necessary to thank the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>&eacute;chevin</i> for his kindness,
which Cropol&eacute; did.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
But Pittrino remained downcast and said he felt assured of what
was about to happen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The visitor was scarcely
gone when Cropol&eacute;, crossing his arms, said: "Well, master,
what is to be done?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "We must efface the
legend," said Pittrino, in a melancholy tone.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I have some excellent ivory-black;
it will be done in a moment, and we will replace the Medici by
the nymphs or the sirens, whichever you prefer."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No," said
Cropol&eacute;, "the will of my father must be carried out.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> My father considered - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He considered the
figures of the most importance," said Pittrino.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He thought most of the
legend," said Cropol&eacute;.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The proof of the
importance in which he held the figures," said Pittrino, "is that
he desired they should be likenesses, and they are so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes; but if they had
not been so, who would have recognized them without the
legend?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the present
day even, when the memory of the Blaisois begins to be faint with
regard to these two celebrated persons, who would recognize
Catherine and Mary without the words '<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>To the Medici</i>'?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But the figures?" said
Pittrino, in despair; for he felt that young Cropol&eacute; was
right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I should not like
to lose the fruit of my labor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And I should not wish
you to be thrown into prison, and myself into the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>oubliettes</i>."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Let us efface
'Medici'," said Pittrino, supplicatingly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No," replied
Cropol&eacute;, firmly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"I have got an idea, a sublime idea - your picture shall appear,
and my legend likewise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Does not 'Medici' mean doctor, or physician, in Italian?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, in the
plural."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, then, you shall
order another sign-frame of the smith; you shall paint six
physicians, and write underneath '<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Aux Medici</i>' which makes a very
pretty play upon words."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Six physicians!
impossible!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And the
composition?" cried Pittrino.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is your business -
but so it shall be - I insist upon it - it must be so - my
macaroni is burning."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This reasoning was
peremptory - Pittrino obeyed.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He composed the sign of six
physicians, with the legend; the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>&eacute;chevin</i> applauded and
authorized it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The sign produced an
extravagant success in the city, which proves that poetry has
always been in the wrong, before citizens, as Pittrino said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Cropol&eacute;, to make
amends to his painter-in-ordinary, hung up the nymphs of the
preceding sign in his bedroom, which made Madame Cropol&eacute;
blush every time she looked at it, when she was undressing at
night.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This is the way in which
the pointed-gable house got a sign; and this is how the hostelry
of the Medici, making a fortune, was found to be enlarged by a
quarter, as we have described.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And this is how there was at Blois a
hostelry of that name, and had for a painter-in-ordinary Master
Pittrino.</p>

'font-size:20.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>
T</span>hus founded and recommended by its sign, the hostelry of
Master Cropol&eacute; held its way steadily on towards a solid
prosperity.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> It was not an immense
fortune that Cropol&eacute; had in perspective; but he might hope
to double the thousand louis d'or left by his father, to make
another thousand louis by the sale of his house and stock, and at
length to live happily like a retired citizen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Cropol&eacute; was
anxious for gain, and was half-crazy with joy at the news of the
arrival of Louis XIV.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Himself, his wife,
Pittrino, and two cooks, immediately laid hands upon all the
inhabitants of the dove-cote, the poultry-yard, and the
rabbit-hutches; so that as many lamentations and cries resounded
in the yards of the hostelry of the Medici as were formerly heard
in Rama.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Cropol&eacute; had, at
the time, but one single traveler in his house.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This was a man of
scarcely thirty years of age, handsome, tall, austere, or rather
melancholy, in all his gestures and looks.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> He was dressed in black
velvet with jet trimmings; a white collar, as plain as that of
the severest Puritan, set off the whiteness of his youthful neck;
a small dark-colored mustache scarcely covered his curled,
disdainful lip.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> He spoke to people
looking them full in the face, without affectation, it is true,
but without scruple; so that the brilliancy of his black eyes
became so insupportable, that more than one look had sunk beneath
his, like the weaker sword in a single combat.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> At this time, in which
men, all created equal by God, were divided, thanks to
prejudices, into two distinct castes, the gentlemen and the
commoner, as they are really divided into two races, the black
and the white, - at this time, we say, he whose portrait we have
just sketched could not fail of being taken for a gentleman, and
of the best class.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To
ascertain this, there was no necessity to consult anything but
his hands, long, slender, and white, of which every muscle, every
vein, became apparent through the skin at the least movement, and
eloquently spoke of good descent.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This gentleman, then,
had arrived alone at Cropol&eacute;'s house.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had taken, without hesitation,
without reflection even, the principal apartment which the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>h&ocirc;telier</i> had
pointed out to him with a rapacious aim, very praiseworthy, some
will say, very reprehensible will say others, if they admit that
Cropol&eacute; was a physiognomist, and judged people at first
sight.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This apartment was that
which composed the whole front of the ancient triangular house; a
large <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>salon</i>, lighted by
two windows on the first stage, a small chamber by the side of
it, and another above it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Now, from the time he
had arrived, this gentleman had scarcely touched any repast that
had been served up to him in his chamber.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had spoken but two words to the
host, to warn him that a traveler of the name of Parry would
arrive, and to desire that, when he did, he should be shown up to
him immediately.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> He afterwards preserved
so profound a silence, that Cropol&eacute; was almost offended,
so much did he prefer people who were good company.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This gentleman had risen
early the morning of the day on which this history begins, and
had placed himself at the window of his <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>salon</i>, seated upon the ledge,
and leaning upon the rail of the balcony, gazing sadly but
persistently on both sides of the street, watching, no doubt, for
the arrival of the traveler he had mentioned to the host.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> In this way he had seen
the little <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cort&eacute;ge</i> of Monsieur
return from hunting, then had again partaken of the profound
tranquillity of the street, absorbed in his own expectations.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> All at once the movement
of the crowd going to the meadows, couriers setting out, washers
of pavement, purveyors of the royal household, gabbling,
scampering shop-boys, chariots in motion, hair-dressers on the
run, and pages toiling along, this tumult and bustle had
surprised him, but without losing any of that impassible and
supreme majesty which gives to the eagle and the lion that serene
and contemptuous glance amidst the hurrahs and shouts of hunters
or the curious.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Soon the cries of the
victims slaughtered in the poultry-yard, the hasty steps of
Madame Cropol&eacute; up that little wooden staircase, so narrow
and so echoing; the bounding pace of Pittrino, who only that
morning was smoking at the door with all the phlegm of a
Dutchman; all this communicated something like surprise and
agitation to the traveler.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> As he was rising to make
inquiries, the door of his chamber opened.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The unknown concluded they were
about to introduce the impatiently expected traveler, and made
three precipitate steps to meet him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> But, instead of the
person he expected, it was Master Cropol&eacute; who appeared,
and behind him, in the half-dark staircase, the pleasant face of
Madame Cropol&eacute;&sbquo; rendered trivial by curiosity.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She only gave one furtive
glance at the handsome gentleman, and disappeared.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Cropol&eacute; advanced,
cap in hand, rather bent than bowing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> A gesture of the unknown
interrogated him, without a word being pronounced.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur," said
Cropol&eacute;&sbquo; "I come to ask how - what ought I to say:
your lordship, monsieur le comte, or monsieur le marquis?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Say <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>monsieur</i>, and speak quickly,"
replied the unknown, with that haughty accent which admits of
neither discussion nor reply.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I came, then, to
inquire how monsieur had passed the night, and if monsieur
intended to keep this apartment?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur, something has
happened upon which we could not reckon."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "His majesty Louis XIV.
will enter our city to-day, and will remain here one day, perhaps
two."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Great astonishment was
painted on the countenance of the unknown.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The King of France is
coming to Blois?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He is on the road,
monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Then there is the
stronger reason for my remaining," said the unknown.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very well; but will
monsieur keep all the apartments?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I do not understand
you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Why should I require
less to-day than yesterday?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Because, monsieur, your
lordship will permit me to say, yesterday I did not think proper,
when you chose your lodging, to fix any price that might have
made your lordship believe that I prejudged your resources;
whilst to-day - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The unknown colored; the
idea at once struck him that he was supposed to be poor, and was
being insulted.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Whilst to-day," replied
he, coldly, "you do not prejudge."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur, I am a
well-meaning man, thank God! and simple <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>h&ocirc;telier</i> as I am, there
is in me the blood of a gentleman.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> My father was a servant and officer
of the late Mar&eacute;chal d'Ancre.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> God rest his soul!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I do not contest that
point with you; I only wish to know, and that quickly, to what
your questions tend?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are too reasonable,
monsieur, not to comprehend that our city is small, that the
court is about to invade it, that the houses will be overflowing
with inhabitants, and that lodgings will consequently obtain
considerable prices."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Again the unknown
colored.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Name your
terms," said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I name them with
scruple, monsieur, because I seek an honest gain, and that I wish
to carry on my business without being uncivil or extravagant in
my demands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now the room
you occupy is considerable, and you are alone."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

business."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! certainly.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I do not mean to turn monsieur
out."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The blood rushed to the
temples of the unknown; he darted at poor Cropol&eacute;&sbquo;
the descendant of one of the officers of the Mar&eacute;chal
d'Ancre, a glance that would have crushed him down to beneath
that famous chimney-slab, if Cropol&eacute; had not been nailed
to the spot by the question of his own proper interests.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do you desire me to
go?" said he.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Explain
yourself - but quickly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur, monsieur, you
do not understand me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It
is very critical - I know - that which I am doing.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I express myself badly, or perhaps,
as monsieur is a foreigner, which I perceive by his accent -
"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> In fact, the unknown
spoke with that impetuosity which is the principal character of
English accentuation, even among men who speak the French
language with the greatest purity.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "As monsieur is a
foreigner, I say, it is perhaps he who does not catch my exact
meaning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I wish for
monsieur to give up one or two of the apartments he occupies,
which would diminish his expenses and ease my conscience.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Indeed, it is hard to increase
unreasonably the price of the chambers, when one has had the
honor to let them at a reasonable price."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

amount to since yesterday?"</p>

with refreshments and the charge for the horse."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very well; and that of
to-day?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! there is the
difficulty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This is the
day of the king's arrival; if the court comes to sleep here, the
charge of the day is reckoned.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> From that it results that three
chambers, at two louis each, make six louis.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Two louis, monsieur, are not much;
but six louis make a great deal."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The unknown, from red,
as we have seen him, became very pale.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> He drew from his pocket,
with heroic bravery, a purse embroidered with a coat-of-arms,
which he carefully concealed in the hollow of his hand.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This purse was of a thinness,
a flabbiness, a hollowness, which did not escape the eye of
Cropol&eacute;.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The unknown emptied the
purse into his hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It
contained three double louis, which amounted to the six louis
demanded by the host.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> But it was seven that
Cropol&eacute; had required.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> He looked, therefore, at
the unknown, as much as to say, "And then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "There remains one
louis, does there not, master h&ocirc;telier?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, monsieur, but -
"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The unknown plunged his
hand into the pocket of his <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>haut-de-chausses</i>, and emptied
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It contained a small
pocket-book, a gold key, and some silver.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> With this change, he made up a
louis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Thank you, monsieur,"
said Cropol&eacute;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "It
now only remains for me to ask whether monsieur intends to occupy
his apartments to-morrow, in which case I will reserve them for
him; whereas, if monsieur does not mean to do so, I will promise
them to some of the king's people who are coming."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is but right,"
said the unknown, after a long silence; "but as I have no more
money, as you have seen, and as I yet must retain the apartments,
you must either sell this diamond in the city, or hold it in
pledge."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Cropol&eacute; looked at
the diamond so long, that the unknown said, hastily:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I prefer your selling
it, monsieur; for it is worth three hundred pistoles.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A Jew - are there any Jews in Blois?
- would give you two hundred or a hundred and fifty for it - take
whatever may be offered for it, if it be no more than the price
of your lodging.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Begone!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! monsieur," replied
Cropol&eacute;&sbquo; ashamed of the sudden inferiority which the
unknown reflected upon him by this noble and disinterested
confidence, as well as by the unalterable patience opposed to so
many suspicions and evasions.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Oh, monsieur, I hope people are not
so dishonest at Blois as you seem to think; and that the diamond,
being worth what you say - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The unknown here again
darted at Cropol&eacute; one of his withering glances.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I really do not
understand diamonds, monsieur, I assure you," cried he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But the jewelers do:
ask them," said the unknown.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Now I believe our accounts are
settled, are they not, monsieur l'h&ocirc;te?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, monsieur, and to
my profound regret; for I fear I have offended monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Not at all!" replied
the unknown, with ineffable majesty.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Or have appeared to be
extortionate with a noble traveler.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Consider, monsieur, the peculiarity
of the case."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Say no more about it, I
desire; and leave me to myself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Cropol&eacute; bowed
profoundly, and left the room with a stupefied air, which
announced that he had a good heart, and felt genuine remorse.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The unknown himself shut
the door after him, and, when left alone, looked mournfully at
the bottom of the purse, from which he had taken a small silken
bag containing the diamond, his last resource.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> He dwelt likewise upon
the emptiness of his pockets, turned over the papers in his
pocket-book, and convinced himself of the state of absolute
destitution in which he was about to be plunged.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> He raised his eyes
towards heaven, with a sublime emotion of despairing calmness,
brushed off with his hand some drops of sweat which trickled over
his noble brow, and then cast down upon the earth a look which
just before had been impressed with almost divine majesty.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> That the storm had
passed far from him, perhaps he had prayed in the bottom of his
soul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> He drew near to the
window, resumed his place in the balcony, and remained there,
motionless, annihilated, dead, till the moment when, the heavens
beginning to darken, the first flambeaux traversed the enlivened
street, and gave the signal for illumination to all the windows
of the city.</p>

W</span>hilst the unknown was viewing these lights with interest,
and lending an ear to the various noises, Master Cropol&eacute;
entered his apartment, followed by two attendants, who laid the
cloth for his meal.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The stranger did not pay
them the least attention; but Cropol&eacute; approaching him
respectfully, whispered, "Monsieur, the diamond has been
valued."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!" said the
traveler.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Well?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, monsieur, the
jeweler of S. A. R. gives two hundred and eighty pistoles for
it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Have you them?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I thought it best to
take them, monsieur; nevertheless, I made it a condition of the
bargain, that if monsieur wished to keep his diamond, it should
be held till monsieur was again in funds."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, no, not at all: I
told you to sell it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Then I have obeyed, or
nearly so, since, without having definitely sold it, I have
touched the money."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Pay yourself," added
the unknown.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I will do so, monsieur,
since you so positively require it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> A sad smile passed over
the lips of the gentleman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Place the money on that
trunk," said he, turning round and pointing to the piece of
furniture.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Cropol&eacute; deposited
a tolerably large bag as directed, after having taken from it the
amount of his reckoning.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Now," said he, "I hope
monsieur will not give me the pain of not taking any supper.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Dinner has already been
refused; this is affronting to the house of <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>les Medici</i>.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Look, monsieur, the supper is on the
table, and I venture to say that it is not a bad one."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The unknown asked for a
glass of wine, broke off a morsel of bread, and did not stir from
the window whilst he ate and drank.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Shortly after was heard
a loud flourish of trumpets; cries arose in the distance, a
confused buzzing filled the lower part of the city, and the first
distinct sound that struck the ears of the stranger was the tramp
of advancing horses.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The king! the king!"
repeated a noisy and eager crowd.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The king!" cried
Cropol&eacute;, abandoning his guest and his ideas of delicacy,
to satisfy his curiosity.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> With Cropol&eacute; were
mingled, and jostled, on the staircase, Madame Cropol&eacute;,
Pittrino, and the waiters and scullions.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cort&eacute;ge</i> advanced slowly,
lighted by a thousand flambeaux, in the streets and from the
windows.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> After a company of
musketeers, a closely ranked troop of gentlemen, came the litter
of monsieur le cardinal, drawn like a carriage by four black
horses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The pages and
people of the cardinal marched behind.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Next came the carriage
of the queen-mother, with her maids of honor at the doors, her
gentlemen on horseback at both sides.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king then appeared,
mounted upon a splendid horse of Saxon breed, with a flowing
mane.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The young prince
exhibited, when bowing to some windows from which issued the most
animated acclamations, a noble and handsome countenance,
illuminated by the flambeaux of his pages.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> By the side of the king,
though a little in the rear, the Prince de Cond&eacute;, M.
Dangeau, and twenty other courtiers, followed by their people and
their baggage, closed this veritably triumphant march.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The pomp was of a military
character.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Some of the courtiers -
the elder ones, for instance - wore traveling dresses; but all
the rest were clothed in warlike panoply.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Many wore the gorget and buff coat
of the times of Henry IV. and Louis XIII.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> When the king passed
before him, the unknown, who had leant forward over the balcony
to obtain a better view, and who had concealed his face by
leaning on his arm, felt his heart swell and overflow with a
bitter jealousy.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The noise of the
trumpets excited him - the popular acclamations deafened him: for
a moment he allowed his reason to be absorbed in this flood of
lights, tumult, and brilliant images.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He is a king!" murmured
he, in an accent of despair.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Then, before he had
recovered from his sombre reverie, all the noise, all the
splendor, had passed away.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the angle of the street there
remained nothing beneath the stranger but a few hoarse,
discordant voices, shouting at intervals "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>Vive le Roi!</i>"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> There remained likewise
the six candles held by the inhabitants of the hostelry <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>des Medici</i>; that is to say, two
for Cropol&eacute;, two for Pittrino, and one for each
scullion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Cropol&eacute;
never ceased repeating, "How good-looking the king is!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> How strongly he resembles his
illustrious father!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A handsome likeness!"
said Pittrino.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And what a lofty
carriage he has!" added Madame Cropol&eacute;, already in
promiscuous commentary with her neighbors of both sexes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Cropol&eacute; was
feeding their gossip with his own personal remarks, without
observing that an old man on foot, but leading a small Irish
horse by the bridle, was endeavoring to penetrate the crowd of
men and women which blocked up the entrance to the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Medici</i>.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But at that moment the voice of the
stranger was heard from the window.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Make way, monsieur
l'h&ocirc;telier, to the entrance of your house!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Cropol&eacute; turned
around, and, on seeing the old man, cleared a passage for
him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The window was instantly
closed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Pittrino pointed out the
way to the newly-arrived guest, who entered without uttering a
word.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The stranger waited for
him on the landing; he opened his arms to the old man, and led
him to a seat.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, no, no, my lord!"
said he.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Sit down in
your presence? - never!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Parry," cried the
gentleman, "I beg you will; you come from England - you come so

"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Rest yourself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

tell me nothing; for if your news had been good, you would not

news is bad."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My lord," said the old
man, "do not hasten to alarm yourself; all is not lost, I

energy, but more particularly resignation."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Parry," said the young
man, "I have reached this place through a thousand snares and
after a thousand difficulties; can you doubt my energy?<span

ten years, in spite of all counsels and all obstacles - have you
faith in my perseverance?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
I have this evening sold the last of my father's diamonds; for I
had nothing wherewith to pay for my lodgings and my host was
about to turn me out."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Parry made a gesture of
indignation, to which the young man replied by a pressure of the
hand and a smile.</p>

hundred and seventy-four pistoles left and I feel myself

Parry; have you faith in my resignation?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The old man raised his
trembling hands towards heaven.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Let me know," said the
stranger, - "disguise nothing from me - what has happened?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

short, my lord; but in the name of Heaven do not tremble so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is impatience,
Parry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Come, what did the
general say to you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

would not receive me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

spy?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, my lord; but I
wrote him a letter."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He read it, and
received me, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Did that letter
thoroughly explain my position and my views?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

with a sad smile; "it painted your very thoughts faithfully."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well - then,
Parry."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Then the general sent
me back the letter by an aide-de-camp, informing me that if I
were found the next day within the circumscription of his
command, he would have me arrested."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Arrested!" murmured the

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To all my letters, my

Whitehall, too," added the old man with a sigh.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The young man leaned
forward, thoughtful and sad.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ay, that's what he did
before his people," said he, endeavoring to cheat himself with
hopes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "But, privately -
between you and him - what did he do? Answer!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Alas! my lord, he sent
to me four cavaliers, who gave me the horse with which you just
now saw me come back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
These cavaliers conducted me, in great haste, to the little port
of Tenby, threw me, rather than embarked me, into a little
fishing-boat, about to sail for Brittany, and here I am."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh!" sighed the young
man, clasping his neck convulsively with his hand, and with a
sob.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Parry, is that all?

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> After this brief reply
ensued a long interval of silence, broken only by the convulsive
beating of the heel of the young man on the floor.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, well, my lord,"
said Parry, more uneasy at the turn the conversation had taken
than at the other.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You know," resumed the
unknown, "that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>my</i>
mother and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>my</i> sister,
whilst all this is going on in honor of the King of France, have
neither money nor bread; you know that I myself shall be poor and
degraded within a fortnight, when all Europe will become
acquainted with what you have told me.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Parry, are there not examples in
which a man of my condition should himself - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Heaven - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

am a coward, and if I do nothing for myself, what will God
do?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No, no; I have two
arms, Parry, and I have a sword."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he struck his arm violently with
his hand, and took down his sword, which hung against the
wall.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What are you going to
do, my lord?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What am I going to do,
Parry? What every one in my family does.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> My mother lives on public charity,
my sister begs for my mother; I have, somewhere or other,
brothers who equally beg for themselves; and I, the eldest, will
go and do as all the rest do - I will go and ask charity!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And with these words,
which he finished sharply with a nervous and terrible laugh, the
young man girded on his sword, took his hat from the trunk,
fastened to his shoulder a black cloak, which he had worn all
during his journey, and pressing the two hands of the old man,
who watched his proceedings with a look of anxiety, -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"My good Parry,"
said he, "order a fire, drink, eat, sleep, and be happy; let us

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> He struck the bag of
pistoles with his clenched hand as he spoke, and it fell heavily
to the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He resumed
that dismal laugh that had so alarmed Parry; and whilst the whole
household was screaming, singing, and preparing to install the
travelers who had been preceded by their lackeys, he glided out
by the principal entrance into the street, where the old man, who
had gone to the window, lost sight of him in a moment.</p>

What his Majesty King Louis XIV. was at the Age of
Twenty-Two.</p>

I</span>t has been seen, by the account we have endeavored to
give of it, that the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>entr&eacute;e</i> of King Louis XIV.
into the city of Blois had been noisy and brilliant; his young
majesty had therefore appeared perfectly satisfied with it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> On arriving beneath the
porch of the Castle of the States, the king met, surrounded by
his guards and gentlemen, with S. A. R. the duke, Gaston of
Orl&eacute;ans, whose physiognomy, naturally rather majestic, had
borrowed on this solemn occasion a fresh luster and a fresh
dignity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On her part,
Madame, dressed in her robes of ceremony, awaited, in the
interior balcony, the entrance of her nephew.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> All the windows of the old castle,
so deserted and dismal on ordinary days, were resplendent with
ladies and lights.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> It was then to the sound
of drums, trumpets, and <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>vivats</i>, that the young king
crossed the threshold of that castle in which, seventy-two years
before, Henry III. had called in the aid of assassination and
treachery to keep upon his head and in his house a crown which
was already slipping from his brow, to fall into another
family.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> All eyes, after having
admired the young king, so handsome and so agreeable, sought for
that other king of France, much otherwise king than the former,
and so old, so pale, so bent, that people called the Cardinal
Mazarin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis was at this time
endowed with all the natural gifts which make the perfect
gentleman; his eye was brilliant, mild, and of a clear azure
blue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But the most
skillful physiognomists, those divers into the soul, on fixing
their looks upon it, if it had been possible for a subject to
sustain the glance of the king, - the most skillful
physiognomists, we say, would never have been able to fathom the
depths of that abyss of mildness.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was with the eyes of the king as
with the immense depths of the azure heavens, or with those more
terrific, and almost as sublime, which the Mediterranean reveals
under the keels of its ships in a clear summer day, a gigantic
mirror in which heaven delights to reflect sometimes its stars,
sometimes its storms.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king was short of
stature - he was scarcely five feet two inches: but his youth
made up for this defect, set off likewise by great nobleness in
all his movements, and by considerable address in all bodily
exercises.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Certes, he was already
quite a king, and it was a great thing to be a king in that
period of traditional devotedness and respect; but as, up to that
time, he had been but seldom and always poorly shown to the
people, as they to whom he was shown saw him by the side of his
mother, a tall woman, and monsieur le cardinal, a man of
commanding presence, many found him so little of a king as to
say, -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why, the king is not so
tall as monsieur le cardinal!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Whatever may be thought
of these physical observations, which were principally made in
the capital, the young king was welcomed as a god by the
inhabitants of Blois, and almost like a king by his uncle and
aunt, Monsieur and Madame, the inhabitants of the castle.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> It must, however, be
allowed, that when he saw, in the hall of reception, chairs of
equal height for himself, his mother, the cardinal, and his uncle
and aunt, a disposition artfully concealed by the semi-circular
form of the assembly, Louis XIV. became red with anger, and
looked around him to ascertain by the countenances of those that
were present, if this humiliation had been prepared for him.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But as he saw nothing upon the
impassible visage of the cardinal, nothing on that of his mother,
nothing on those of the assembly, he resigned himself, and sat
down, taking care to be seated before anybody else.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The gentlemen and ladies
were presented to their majesties and monsieur le cardinal.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king remarked that
his mother and he scarcely knew the names of any of the persons
who were presented to them; whilst the cardinal, on the contrary,
never failed, with an admirable memory and presence of mind, to
talk to every one about his estates, his ancestors, or his
children, some of whom he named, which enchanted those worthy
country gentlemen, and confirmed them in the idea that he alone
is truly king who knows his subjects, from the same reason that
the sun has no rival, because the sun alone warms and
lightens.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The study of the young
king, which had begun a long time before, without anybody
suspecting it, was continued then, and he looked around him
attentively to endeavor to make out something in the
physiognomies which had at first appeared the most insignificant
and trivial.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> A collation was
served.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king, without
daring to call upon the hospitality of his uncle, had waited for
it impatiently.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This
time, therefore, he had all the honors due, if not to his rank,
at least to his appetite.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> As to the cardinal, he
contented himself with touching with his withered lips a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bouillon</i>, served in a
golden cup.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
all-powerful minister, who had taken her regency from the queen,
and his royalty from the king, had not been able to take a good
stomach from nature.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Anne of Austria, already
suffering from the cancer which six or eight years after caused
her death, ate very little more than the cardinal.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> For Monsieur, already
puffed up with the great event which had taken place in his
provincial life, he ate nothing whatever.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Madame alone, like a
true Lorrainer, kept pace with his majesty; so that Louis XIV.,
who, without this partner, might have eaten nearly alone, was at
first much pleased with his aunt, and afterwards with M. de
Saint-R&eacute;my, her <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>, who
had really distinguished himself.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The collation over, at a
sign of approbation from M. de Mazarin, the king arose, and, at
the invitation of his aunt, walked about among the ranks of the
assembly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The ladies then observed
- there are certain things for which women are as good observers
at Blois as at Paris -<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
the ladies then observed that Louis XIV. had a prompt and bold
look, which premised a distinguished appreciator of beauty.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The men, on their part,
observed that the prince was proud and haughty, that he loved to
look down those who fixed their eyes upon him too long or too
earnestly, which gave presage of a master.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis XIV. had
accomplished about a third of his review when his ears were
struck with a word which his eminence pronounced whilst
conversing with Monsieur.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This word was the name
of a woman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Scarcely had Louis XIV.
heard this word than he heard, or rather listening to nothing
else; and neglecting the arc of the circle which awaited his
visit, his object seemed to be to come as quickly as possible to
the extremity of the curve.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monsieur, like a good
courtier, was inquiring of monsieur le cardinal after the health
of his nieces; he regretted, he said, not having the pleasure of
receiving them at the same time with their uncle; they must
certainly have grown in stature, beauty and grace, as they had
promised to do the last time Monsieur had seen them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> What had first struck
the king was a certain constraint in the voices of the two
interlocutors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The voice
of Monsieur was calm and natural when he spoke thus; while that
of M. de Mazarin jumped by a note and a half to reply above the
diapason of his usual voice.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It might have been said that he
wished that voice to strike, at the end of the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>salon</i>, any ear that was too
distant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monseigneur," replied
he, "Mesdemoiselles de Mazarin have still to finish their
education: they have duties to fulfill, and a position to
make.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> An abode in a young
and brilliant court would dissipate them a little."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis, at this last
sentence, smiled sadly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The court was young, it was true, but the avarice of the cardinal
had taken good care that it should not be brilliant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You have nevertheless
no intention," replied Monsieur, "to cloister them or make them
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>borgeoises</i>?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Not at all," replied
the cardinal, forcing his Italian pronunciation in such a manner
that, from soft and velvety as it was, it became sharp and
vibrating; "not at all: I have a full and fixed intention to
marry them, and that as well as I shall be able."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Parties will not be
wanting, monsieur le cardinal," replied Monsieur, with a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bonhomie</i> worthy of one
tradesman congratulating another.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I hope not,
monseigneur, and with reason, as God has been pleased to give
them grace, intelligence, and beauty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> During this
conversation, Louis XIV., conducted by Madame, accomplished, as
we have described, the circle of presentations.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Mademoiselle Auricule,"
said the princess, presenting to his majesty a fat, fair girl of
two-and-twenty, who at a village <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>f&ecirc;te</i> might have been taken
for a peasant in Sunday finery, - "the daughter of my
music-mistress."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king smiled.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame had never been able to
extract four correct notes from either viol or harpsichord.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Mademoiselle Aure de
Montalais," continued Madame; "a young lady of rank, and my good
attendant."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This time it was not the
king that smiled; it was the young lady presented, because, for
the first time in her life, she heard, given to her by Madame,
who generally showed no tendency to spoil her, such an honorable
qualification.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Our old acquaintance
Montalais, therefore, made his majesty a profound courtesy, the
more respectful from the necessity she was under of concealing
certain contractions of her laughing lips, which the king might
not have attributed to their real cause.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> It was just at this
moment that the king caught the word which startled him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And the name of the
third?" asked Monsieur.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Mary, monseigneur,"
replied the cardinal.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> There was doubtless some
magical influence in that word, for, as we have said, the king
started in hearing it, and drew Madame towards the middle of the
circle, as if he wished to put some confidential question to her,
but, in reality, for the sake of getting nearer to the
cardinal.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Madame, my aunt," said
he, laughing, and in a suppressed voice, "my geography-master did
not teach me that Blois was at such an immense distance from
Paris."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What do you mean,
nephew?" asked Madame.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why, because it would
appear that it requires several years, as regards fashion, to
travel the distance! - Look at those young ladies!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well; I know them
all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Some of them are
pretty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Don't say that too
loud, monsieur my nephew; you will drive them wild."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Stop a bit, stop a bit,
dear aunt!" said the king, smiling; "for the second part of my
sentence will serve as a corrective to the first.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well, my dear aunt, some of them
appear old and others ugly, thanks to their ten-year-old
fashions."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But, sire, Blois is
only five days' journey from Paris."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, that is it," said
the king: "two years behind for each day."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Indeed! do you really
think so?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well, that is
strange!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It never struck
me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Now, look, aunt," said
Louis XIV., drawing still nearer to Mazarin, under the pretext of
gaining a better point of view, "look at that simple white dress
by the side of those antiquated specimens of finery, and those
pretentious coiffures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
She is probably one of my mother's maids of honor, though I don't
know her."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! ah! my dear
nephew!" replied Madame, laughing; "permit me to tell you that
your divinatory science is at fault for once.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The young lady you honor with your
praise is not a Parisian, but a Blaisoise."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, aunt!" replied the
king with a look of doubt.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Come here, Louise,"
said Madame.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And the fair girl,
already known to you under that name, approached them, timid,
blushing, and almost bent beneath the royal glance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Mademoiselle Louise
Fran&ccedil;oise de la Beaume le Blanc, the daughter of the
Marquise de la Valli&egrave;re," said Madame, ceremoniously.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The young girl bowed
with so much grace, mingled with the profound timidity inspired
by the presence of the king, that the latter lost, while looking
at her, a few words of the conversation of Monsieur and the
cardinal.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Daughter-in-law,"
continued Madame, "of M. de Saint-R&eacute;my, my <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>, who
presided over the confection of that excellent <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>daube truff&eacute;e</i> which your
majesty seemed so much to appreciate."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> No grace, no youth, no
beauty, could stand out against such a presentation.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king smiled.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Whether the words of Madame were a
pleasantry, or uttered in all innocency, they proved the pitiless
immolation of everything that Louis had found charming or poetic
in the young girl.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re, for Madame and, by rebound,
for the king, was, for a moment, no more than the daughter of a
man of a superior talent over <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>dindes truff&eacute;es</i>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> But princes are thus
constituted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The gods,
too, were just like this in Olympus.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Diana and Venus, no doubt, abused
the beautiful Alcmena and poor Io, when they condescended for
distraction's sake, to speak, amidst nectar and ambrosia, of
mortal beauties, at the table of Jupiter.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Fortunately, Louise was
so bent in her reverential salute, that she did not catch either
Madame's words or the king's smile.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In fact, if the poor child, who had
so much good taste as alone to have chosen to dress herself in
white amidst all her companions - if that dove's heart, so easily
accessible to painful emotions, had been touched by the cruel
words of Madame, or the egotistical cold smile of the king, it
would have annihilated her.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And Montalais herself,
the girl of ingenious ideas, would not have attempted to recall
her to life; for ridicule kills beauty even.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> But fortunately, as we
have said, Louise, whose ears were buzzing, and her eyes veiled
by timidity, - Louise saw nothing and heard nothing; and the
king, who had still his attention directed to the conversation of
the cardinal and his uncle, hastened to return to them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> He came up just at the
moment Mazarin terminated by saying: "Mary, as well as her
sisters, has just set off for Brouage.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I make them follow the opposite bank
of the Loire to that along which we have traveled; and if I
calculate their progress correctly, according to the orders I
have given, they will to-morrow be opposite Blois."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> These words were
pronounced with that tact - that measure, that distinctness of
tone, of intention, and reach - which made <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>del Signor Giulio Mazarini</i> the
first comedian in the world.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> It resulted that they
went straight to the heart of Louis XIV., and the cardinal, on
turning round at the simple noise of the approaching footsteps of
his majesty, saw the immediate effect of them upon the
countenance of his pupil, an effect betrayed to the keen eyes of
his eminence by a slight increase of color.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But what was the ventilation of such
a secret to him whose craft had for twenty years deceived all the
diplomatists of Europe?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> From the moment the
young king heard these last words, he appeared as if he had
received a poisoned arrow in his heart.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He could not remain quiet in a
place, but cast around an uncertain, dead, and aimless look over
the assembly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He with his
eyes interrogated his mother more than twenty times: but she,
given up to the pleasure of conversing with her sister-in-law,
and likewise constrained by the glance of Mazarin, did not appear
to comprehend any of the supplications conveyed by the looks of
her son.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> From this moment, music,
lights, flowers, beauties, all became odious and insipid to Louis
XIV.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> After he had a
hundred times bitten his lips, stretched his legs and his arms
like a well-brought-up child, who, without daring to gape,
exhausts all the modes of evincing his weariness - after having
uselessly again implored his mother and the minister, he turned a
despairing look towards the door, that is to say, towards
liberty.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> At this door, in the
embrasure of which he was leaning, he saw, standing out strongly,
a figure with a brown and lofty countenance, an aquiline nose, a
stern but brilliant eye, gray and long hair, a black mustache,
the true type of military beauty, whose gorget, more sparkling
than a mirror, broke all the reflected lights which concentrated
upon it, and sent them back as lightning.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This officer wore his gray hat with
its long red plumes upon his head, a proof that he was called
there by his duty, and not by his pleasure.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If he had been brought thither by
his pleasure - if he had been a courtier instead of a soldier, as
pleasure must always be paid for at the same price - he would
have held his hat in his hand.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> That which proved still
better that this officer was upon duty, and was accomplishing a
task to which he was accustomed, was, that he watched, with
folded arms, remarkable indifference, and supreme apathy, the
joys and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ennuis</i> of this
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>f&ecirc;te</i>.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Above all, he appeared, like a
philosopher, and all old soldiers are philosophers, - he appeared
above all to comprehend the<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ennuis</i> infinitely better than
the joys; but in the one he took his part, knowing very well how
to do without the other.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Now, he was leaning, as
we have said, against the carved door-frame when the melancholy,
weary eyes of the king, by chance, met his.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> It was not the first
time, as it appeared, that the eyes of the officer had met those
eyes, and he was perfectly acquainted with the expression of
them; for, as soon as he had cast his own look upon the
countenance of Louis XIV., and had read by it what was passing in
his heart - that is to say, all the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>ennui</i> that oppressed him - all
the timid desire to go out which agitated him, - he perceived he
must render the king a service without his commanding it, -
almost in spite of himself.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Boldly, therefore, as if he had
given the word of command to cavalry in battle, "On the king's
service!" cried he, in a clear, sonorous voice.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> At these words, which
produced the effect of a peal of thunder, prevailing over the
orchestra, the singing and the buzz of the promenaders, the
cardinal and the queen-mother looked at each other with
surprise.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis XIV., pale, but
resolved, supported as he was by that intuition of his own
thought which he had found in the mind of the officer of
musketeers, and which he had just manifested by the order given,
arose from his chair, and took a step towards the door.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Are you going, my son?"
said the queen, whilst Mazarin satisfied himself with
interrogating by a look which might have appeared mild if it had
not been so piercing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, madame," replied
the king; "I am fatigued, and, besides, wish to write this
evening."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> A smile stole over the
lips of the minister, who appeared, by a bend of the head, to
give the king permission.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monsieur and Madame
hastened to give orders to the officers who presented
themselves.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king bowed, crossed
the hall, and gained the door, where a hedge of twenty musketeers
awaited him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the
extremity of this hedge stood the officer, impassible, with his
drawn sword in his hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The king passed, and all the crowd stood on tip-toe, to have one
more look at him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Ten musketeers, opening
the crowd of the ante-chambers and the steps, made way for his
majesty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The other ten
surrounded the king and Monsieur, who had insisted upon
accompanying his majesty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The domestics walked behind.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This little <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>cort&eacute;ge</i> escorted the
king to the chamber destined for him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The apartment was the same that had
been occupied by Henry III. during his sojourn in the States.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monsieur had given his
orders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The musketeers,
led by their officer, took possession of the little passage by
which one wing of the castle communicates with the other.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This passage was commenced by
a small square ante-chamber, dark even in the finest days.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monsieur stopped Louis
XIV.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are passing now,
sire," said he, "the very spot where the Duc de Guise received
the first stab of the poniard."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king was ignorant of
all historical matters; he had heard of the fact, but he knew
nothing of the localities or the details.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!" said he with a
shudder.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And he stopped.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The rest, both behind and
before him, stopped likewise.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The duc, sire,"
continued Gaston, "was nearly were I stand: he was walking in the
same direction as your majesty; M. de Loignac was exactly where
your lieutenant of musketeers is; M. de Saint-Maline and his
majesty's ordinaries were behind him and around him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was here that he was struck."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king turned towards
his officer, and saw something like a cloud pass over his martial
and daring countenance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, from behind!"
murmured the lieutenant, with a gesture of supreme disdain.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he endeavored to resume
the march, as if ill at ease at being between walls formerly
defiled by treachery.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> But the king, who
appeared to wish to be informed, was disposed to give another
look at this dismal spot.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Gaston perceived his
nephew's desire.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Look, sire," said he,
taking a flambeaux from the hands of M. de Saint-R&eacute;my,
"this is where he fell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
There was a bed there, the curtains of which he tore with
catching at them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why does the floor seem
hollowed out at this spot?" asked Louis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Because it was here the
blood flowed," replied Gaston; "the blood penetrated deeply into
the oak, and it was only by cutting it out that they succeeded in
making it disappear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And
even then," added Gaston, pointing the flambeaux to the spot,
"even then this red stain resisted all the attempts made to
destroy it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis XIV. raised his
head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Perhaps he was
thinking of that bloody trace that had once been shown him at the
Louvre, and which, as a pendant to that of Blois, had been made
there one day by the king his father with the blood of
Concini.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Let us go on," said
he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The march was resumed
promptly; for emotion, no doubt, had given to the voice of the
young prince a tone of command which was not customary with
him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When he arrived at
the apartment destined for the king, which communicated not only
with the little passage we have passed through, but further with
the great staircase leading to the court, -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Will your majesty,"
said Gaston, "condescend to occupy this apartment, all unworthy
as it is to receive you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Uncle," replied the
young king, "I render you my thanks for your cordial
hospitality."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Gaston bowed to his
nephew, embraced him, and then went out.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Of the twenty musketeers
who had accompanied the king, ten reconducted Monsieur to the
reception-rooms, which were not yet empty, notwithstanding the
king had retired.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The ten others were
posted by their officer, who himself explored, in five minutes,
all the localities, with that cold and certain glance which not
even habit gives unless that glance belongs to genius.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Then, when all were
placed, he chose as his headquarters the ante-chamber, in which
he found a large <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>fauteuil</i>, a lamp, some wine,
some water, and some dry bread.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> He refreshed his lamp,
drank half a glass of wine, curled his lip with a smile full of
expression, installed himself in his large armchair, and made
preparations for sleeping.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

musketeers, he commanded all the company which came from Paris,
and that company consisted of a hundred and twenty men; but, with
the exception of the twenty of whom we have spoken, the other
hundred were engaged in guarding the queen-mother, and more
particularly the cardinal.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monsignor Giulio
Mazarini economized the traveling expenses of his guards; he
consequently used the king's, and that largely, since he took
fifty of them for himself - a peculiarity which would not have
failed to strike any one unacquainted with the usages of that
court.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> That which would still
further have appeared, if not inconvenient, at least
extraordinary, to a stranger, was, that the side of the castle
destined for monsieur le cardinal was brilliant, light and
cheerful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The musketeers
there mounted guard before every door, and allowed no one to
enter, except the couriers, who, even while he was traveling,
followed the cardinal for the carrying on of his
correspondence.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Twenty men were on duty
with the queen-mother; thirty rested, in order to relieve their
companions the next day.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> On the king's side, on
the contrary, were darkness, silence, and solitude.<span style=

"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> All the servitors had by degrees

Prince had sent to know if his majesty required his attendance;
and on the customary "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>No</i>" of the lieutenant of
musketeers, who was habituated to the question and the reply, all
appeared to sink into the arms of sleep, as if in the dwelling of
a good citizen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And yet it was possible
to hear from the side of the house occupied by the young king the
music of the banquet, and to see the windows of the great hall
richly illuminated.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Ten minutes after his
installation in his apartment, Louis XIV. had been able to learn,
by movement much more distinguished than marked his own leaving,
the departure of the cardinal, who, in his turn, sought his
bedroom, accompanied by a large escort of ladies and
gentlemen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Besides, to perceive
this movement, he had nothing to do but look out at his window,
the shutters of which had not been closed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> His eminence crossed the
court, conducted by Monsieur, who himself held a flambeau; then
followed the queen-mother, to whom Madame familiarly gave her
arm; and both walked chatting away, like two old friends.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Behind these two couples
filed nobles, ladies, pages and officers; the flambeaux gleamed
over the whole court, like the moving reflections of a
conflagration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then the
noise of steps and voices became lost in the upper floors of the
castle.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> No one was then thinking
of the king, who, leaning on his elbow at his window, had sadly
seen pass away all that light, and heard that noise die off - no,
not one, if it was not that unknown of the hostelry <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>des Medici</i>, whom we have seen
go out, enveloped in his cloak.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> He had come straight up
to the castle, and had, with his melancholy countenance, wandered
round and round the palace, from which the people had not yet
departed; and finding that on one guarded the great entrance, or
the porch, seeing that the soldiers of Monsieur were fraternizing
with the royal soldiers - that is to say, swallowing Beaugency at
discretion, or rather indiscretion - the unknown penetrated
through the crowd, then ascended to the court, and came to the
landing of the staircase leading to the cardinal's apartment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> What, according to all
probability, induced him to direct his steps that way, was the
splendor of the flambeaux, and the busy air of the pages and
domestics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But he was
stopped short by a presented musket and the cry of the
sentinel.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Where are you going, my
friend?" asked the soldier.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

king's apartment," replied the unknown, haughtily, but
tranquilly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The soldier called one
of his eminence's officers, who, in the tone in which a youth in
office directs a solicitor to a minister, let fall these words:
"The other staircase, in front."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And the officer, without
further notice of the unknown, resumed his interrupted
conversation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The stranger, without
reply, directed his steps towards the staircase pointed out to
him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On this side there
was no noise, there were no more flambeaux.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

the guard.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

arms, overcome by the dignity with which these words were
pronounced.</p>

he; "and if you ask me anything in my power - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

absolutely speak to the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The lieutenant looked
attentively at the unknown, and in that look, he saw all he
wished to see - that is to say, a person of high distinction in
an ordinary dress.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I do not suppose you to
be mad," replied he; "and yet you seem to me to be in a condition
to know, monsieur, that people do not enter a king's apartments
in this manner without his consent."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He will consent."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur, permit me to
doubt that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king has

given."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

he will recall the word."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The officer was more and
more surprised, more and more subdued.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "If I consent to
announce you, may I at least know whom to announce,
monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You will announce His
Majesty Charles II., King of England, Scotland, and Ireland."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The officer uttered a
cry of astonishment, drew back, and there might be seen upon his
pallid countenance one of the most poignant emotions that ever an
energetic man endeavored to drive back to his heart.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, yes, sire; in
fact," said he, "I ought to have recognized you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You have seen my
portrait, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Or else you have seen
me formerly at court, before I was driven from France?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, sire, it is not
even that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "How then could you have
recognized me, if you have never seen my portrait or my
person?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, I saw his majesty
your father at a terrible moment."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The day - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> A dark cloud passed over
the brow of the prince; then, dashing his hand across it, "Do you
see any difficulty in announcing me?" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, pardon me,"
replied the officer, "but I could not imagine a king under so
simple an exterior; and yet I had the honor to tell your majesty
just now that I had seen Charles I.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But pardon me, monsieur; I will go
and inform the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> But returning after
going a few steps, "Your majesty is desirous, without doubt, that
this interview should be a secret?" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I do not require it;
but if it were possible to preserve it - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is possible, sire,
for I can dispense with informing the first gentleman on duty;
but, for that, your majesty must please to consent to give up
your sword."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "True, true; I had
forgotten that no one armed is permitted to enter the chamber of
a king of France."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your majesty will form
an exception, if you wish it; but then I shall avoid my
responsibility by informing the king's attendant."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Here is my sword,
monsieur.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Will you now
please to announce me to his majesty?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Instantly, sire."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And the officer immediately
went and knocked at the door of communication, which the valet
opened to him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "His Majesty the King of
England!" said the officer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

England!" replied the <i style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> At these words a
gentleman opened the folding-doors of the king's apartment, and
Louis XIV. was seen, without hat or sword, and his <i style=

signs of the greatest surprise.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You, my brother - you
at Blois!" cried Louis XIV., dismissing with a gesture both the
gentlemen and the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>valet de

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire," replied Charles
II., "I was going to Paris, in the hope of seeing your majesty,
when report informed me of your approaching arrival in this
city.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I therefore
prolonged my abode here, having something very particular to
communicate to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Will this closet suit
you, my brother?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

for I think no one can hear us here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I have dismissed my
gentleman and my watcher; they are in the next chamber.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There, behind that partition,
is a solitary closet, looking into the ante-chamber, and in that
ante-chamber you found nobody but a solitary officer, did
you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, then, speak, my
brother; I listen to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, I commence, and
entreat your majesty to have pity on the misfortunes of our
house."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king of France
colored, and drew his chair closer to that of the king of
England.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire," said Charles
II., "I have no need to ask if your majesty is acquainted with
the details of my deplorable history."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis XIV. blushed, this
time more strongly than before; then, stretching forth his hand
to that of the king of England, "My brother," said he, "I am
ashamed to say so, but the cardinal scarcely ever speaks of
political affairs before me.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Still more, formerly I used to get
Laporte, my <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>valet de

to these readings, and took away Laporte from me.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> So that I beg my brother Charles to
tell me all those matters as to a man who knows nothing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, sire, I think
that by taking things from the beginning I shall have a better
chance of touching the heart of your majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

speak on."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You know, sire, that
being called in 1650 to Edinburgh, during Cromwell's expedition
into Ireland, I was crowned at Scone.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A year after, wounded in one of the
provinces he had usurped, Cromwell returned upon us.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To meet him was my object; to leave
Scotland was my wish."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And yet," interrupted
the young king, "Scotland is almost your native country, is it
not, my brother?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, but the Scots were
cruel compatriots for me, sire; they had forced me to forsake the
religion of my fathers; they had hung Lord Montrose, the most
devoted of my servants, because he was not a Covenanter; and as
the poor martyr, to whom they had offered a favor when dying, had
asked that his body might be cut into as many pieces as there are
cities in Scotland, in order that evidence of his fidelity might
be met with everywhere, I could not leave one city, or go into
another, without passing under some fragments of a body which had
acted, fought, and breathed for me.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "By a bold, almost
desperate march, I passed through Cromwell's army, and entered
England.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The Protector
set out in pursuit of this strange flight, which had a crown for
its object.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If I had been

write all this, sire, for the instruction of my brother
kings.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

on arriving at the residence of Mr. Norton, I met with a court
chaplain, who was looking on at a party playing at skittles, and
an old servant who named me, bursting into tears, and who was as
near and as certainly killing me by his fidelity as another might
have been by treachery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Then I will tell of my terrors - yes, sire, of my terrors - when,
at the house of Colonel Windham, a farrier who came to shoe our

Louis XIV.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I never heard

Louis XIV., "how, after being so roughly received in England, you

signed a treaty with France, in which his name is placed above
yours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He died on the 3rd

heavy for Richard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Richard was neither a republican nor a royalist; Richard allowed
his guards to eat his dinner, and his generals to govern the

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "From that time England
is nothing but a tennis-court, in which the players throw dice

Lambert and Monk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well,

corrupt one of these players and make an ally of him, or two

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

month, whether I oppose Lambert to Monk, or Monk to Lambert, I
shall have reconquered my paternal inheritance, without having
cost my country a guinea, or my subjects a drop of blood, for

republics, and ask nothing better than to fall staggering to
sleep in the arms of royalty.<span style=

owe you more than I owe my father, - my poor father, who bought
at so dear a rate the ruin of our house!<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

appeared to revolt against the filial blasphemy.</p>

you!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We have not obtained
our end yet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To ask money
of Mazarin - that is worse than traversing the enchanted forest,
each tree of which inclosed a demon.<span style=

the king of England turn pale.</p>

wounded man, made a retreating movement - "Pardon me, my

W</span>hilst the king was directing his course rapidly towards
the wing of the castle occupied by the cardinal, taking nobody
with him but his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>valet de
chambre</i>, the officer of musketeers came out, breathing like a
man who has for a long time been forced to hold his breath, from
the little cabinet of which we have already spoken, and which the
king believed to be quite solitary.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This little cabinet had formerly
been part of the chamber, from which it was only separated by a
thin partition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It
resulted that this partition, which was only for the eye,
permitted the ear the least indiscreet to hear every word spoken
in the chamber.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> There was no doubt,
then, that this lieutenant of musketeers had heard all that
passed in his majesty's apartment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Warned by the last words
of the young king, he came out just in time to salute him on his
passage, and to follow him with his eyes till he had disappeared
in the corridor.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Then as soon as he had
disappeared, he shook his head after a fashion peculiarly his
own, and in a voice which forty years' absence from Gascony had
not deprived of its Gascon accent, "A melancholy service," said
he, "and a melancholy master!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> These words pronounced,
the lieutenant resumed his place in his <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>fauteuil</i>, stretched his legs
and closed his eyes, like a man who either sleeps or
meditates.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> During this short
monologue and the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mise en
sc&egrave;ne</i> that had accompanied it, whilst the king,
through the long corridors of the old castle, proceeded to the
apartment of M. de Mazarin, a scene of another sort was being
enacted in those apartments.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Mazarin was in bed,
suffering a little from the gout.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But as he was a man of order, who
utilized even pain, he forced his wakefulness to be the humble
servant of his labor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He
had consequently ordered Bernouin, his <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>valet de chambre</i>, to bring him
a little traveling-desk, so that he might write in bed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But the gout is not an
adversary that allows itself to be conquered so easily;
therefore, at each movement he made, the pain from dull became
sharp.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Is Brienne there?"
asked he of Bernouin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, monseigneur,"
replied the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>valet de
chambre</i>; "M. de Brienne, with your permission, is gone to
bed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But if it is the
wish of your eminence, he can speedily be called."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, it is not worth

however.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Cursed
ciphers!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And the cardinal began
to think, counting on his fingers the while.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, ciphers is it?"
said Bernouin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Very

two hundred and sixty thousand livres, monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!" cried the
cardinal, in a tone of vexation; "there are not yet forty
millions!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Bernouin recommenced the
addition.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, monseigneur; there
want seven hundred and forty thousand livres."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Mazarin asked for the
account, and revised it carefully.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, but," said
Bernouin, "thirty-nine millions two hundred and sixty thousand
livres make a good round sum."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah, Bernouin; I wish
the king had it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your eminence told me
that this money was his majesty's."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Doubtless, as clear, as
transparent as possible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
These thirty-nine millions are bespoken, and much more."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Bernouin smiled after
his own fashion - that is, like a man who believes no more than
he is willing to believe - whilst preparing the cardinal's night
draught, and putting his pillow to rights.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh!" said Mazarin, when
the valet had gone out; "not yet forty millions!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I must, however, attain that sum,
which I had set down for myself.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But who knows whether I shall have
time?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I sink, I am going,
I shall never reach it!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
And yet, who knows that I may not find two or three millions in
the pockets of my good friends the Spaniards?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They discovered Peru, those people
did, and - what the devil! they must have something left."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> As he was speaking thus,
entirely occupied with his ciphers, and thinking no more of his
gout, repelled by a preoccupation which, with the cardinal, was
the most powerful of all preoccupations, Bernouin rushed into the
chamber, quite in a fright.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well!" asked the
cardinal, "what is the matter now?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The king, monseigneur,
- the king!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "How? - the king!" said
Mazarin, quickly concealing his paper.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "The king here! the king at this
hour!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I thought he was in
bed long ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What is the
matter, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king could hear
these last words, and see the terrified gesture of the cardinal
rising up in his bed, for he entered the chamber at that
moment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is nothing, monsieur
le cardinal, or at least nothing which can alarm you.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is an important communication
which I wish to make to your eminence to-night, - that is
all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Mazarin immediately
thought of that marked attention which the king had given to his
words concerning Mademoiselle de Mancini, and the communication
appeared to him probably to refer to this source.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He recovered his serenity then
instantly, and assumed his most agreeable air, a change of
countenance which inspired the king with the greatest joy; and
when Louis was seated, -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire," said the
cardinal, "I ought certainly to listen to your majesty standing,
but the violence of my complaint - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No ceremony between us,
my dear monsieur le cardinal," said Louis kindly: "I am your
pupil, and not the king, you know very well, and this evening in
particular, as I come to you as a petitioner, as a solicitor, and
one very humble, and desirous to be kindly received, too."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Mazarin, seeing the
heightened color of the king, was confirmed in his first idea;
that is to say, that love thoughts were hidden under all these
fine words.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This time,
political cunning, as keen as it was, made a mistake; this color
was not caused by the bashfulness of a juvenile passion, but only
by the painful contraction of the royal pride.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Like a good uncle,
Mazarin felt disposed to facilitate the confidence.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Speak, sire," said he,
"and since your majesty is willing for an instant to forget that
I am your subject, and call me your master and instructor, I
promise your majesty my most devoted and tender
consideration."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Thanks, monsieur le
cardinal," answered the king; "that which I have to ask of your
eminence has but little to do with myself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "So much the worse!"
replied the cardinal; "so much the worse!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Sire, I should wish your majesty to
ask of me something of importance, even a sacrifice; but whatever
it may be that you ask me, I am ready to set your heart at rest
by granting it, my dear sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, this is what
brings me here," said the king, with a beating of the heart that
had no equal except the beating of the heart of the minister; "I
have just received a visit from my brother, the king of
England."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Mazarin bounded in his
bed as if he had been put in relation with a Leyden jar or a
voltaic pile, at the same time that a surprise, or rather a
manifest disappointment, inflamed his features with such a blaze
of anger, that Louis XIV., little diplomatist as he was, saw that
the minister had hoped to hear something else.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Charles II.?" exclaimed
Mazarin, with a hoarse voice and a disdainful movement of his
lips.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "You have received
a visit from Charles II.?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "From King Charles II.,"
replied Louis, according in a marked manner to the grandson of
Henry IV. the title which Mazarin had forgotten to give him.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Yes, monsieur le cardinal,
that unhappy prince has touched my heart with the relation of his
misfortunes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His distress
is great, monsieur le cardinal, and it has appeared painful to
me, who have seen my own throne disputed, who have been forced in
times of commotion to quit my capital, - to me, in short, who am
acquainted with misfortune, - to leave a deposed and fugitive
brother without assistance."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Eh!" said the cardinal,
sharply; "why had he not, as you have, a Jules Mazarin by his
side?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His crown would
then have remained intact."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I know all that my
house owes to your eminence," replied the king, haughtily, "and
you may well believe that I, on my part, shall never forget
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is precisely
because my brother, the king of England has not about him the
powerful genius who has saved me, it is for that, I say, that I
wish to conciliate the aid of that same genius, and beg you to
extend your arm over his head, well assured, monsieur le
cardinal, that your hand, by touching him only, would know how to
replace upon his brow the crown which fell at the foot of his
father's scaffold."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire," replied Mazarin,
"I thank you for your good opinion with regard to myself, but we
have nothing to do yonder: they are a set of madmen who deny God,
and cut off the heads of their kings.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They are dangerous, observe, sire,
and filthy to the touch after having wallowed in royal blood and
covenantal murder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That
policy has never suited me, - I scorn it and reject it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Therefore you ought to
assist in establishing a better."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What is that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The restoration of
Charles II., for example."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Good heavens!" cried
Mazarin, "does the poor prince flatter himself with that
chimera?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, he does," replied
the young king, terrified at the difficulties opposed to this
project, which he fancied he could perceive in the infallible eye
of his minister; "he only asks for a million to carry out his
purpose."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Is that all - a little
million, if you please!" said the cardinal, ironically, with an
effort to conquer his Italian accent.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "A little million, if you please,
brother!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Bah! a family of
mendicants!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Cardinal," said Louis,
raising his head, "that family of mendicants is a branch of my
family."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Are you rich enough to
give millions to other people, sire?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Have you millions to throw
away?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh!" replied Louis
XIV., with great pain, which he, however, by a strong effort,
prevented from appearing on his countenance; - "oh! yes, monsieur
le cardinal, I am well aware I am poor, and yet the crown of
France is worth a million, and to perform a good action I would
pledge my crown if it were necessary.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I could find Jews who would be
willing to lend me a million."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "So, sire, you say you
want a million?" said Mazarin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

the king, "are you going to consult a lackey about my

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Bernouin; that is all I wanted to know.<span style=

fixing his brilliant eye upon the young king, who sat mute with
stupefaction.</p>

the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

under his bolster the paper covered with figures, which he
presented to the king, who turned away his eyes, his vexation was
so deep.</p>

'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Therefore, as it is a

the world would lend such a sum, even upon the crown of
France."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king, clenching his
hands beneath his ruffles, pushed away his chair.</p>

said he; "my brother the king of England will die of hunger."</p>

in the same tone, "remember this proverb, which I give you as the
expression of the soundest policy: 'Rejoice at being poor when
your neighbor is poor likewise.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis meditated this for
a few moments, with an inquisitive glance directed to the paper,
one end of which remained under the bolster.</p>

I</span>nstead of the hesitation with which he had accosted the
cardinal a quarter of an hour before, there might be read in the
eyes of the young king that will against which a struggle might
be maintained, and which might be crushed by its own impotence,
but which, at least, would preserve, like a wound in the depth of
the heart, the remembrance of its defeat.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

cried the minister, with a triumphant accent.<span style=

million. - 'I shall conquer with these five hundred gentlemen,
sire, and all the honor will be yours.'<span style=

that purpose, was it not? - turning those plain words into
brilliant metaphors and pompous images, for they are fine talkers

custom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I return, then,
to M. Cromwell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You have
a treaty with him, that is to say, with England, since when you

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

his son Richard has succeeded him, and has abdicated."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

exactly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Richard
inherited after the death of his father, and England at the
abdication of Richard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The treaty formed part of the inheritance, whether in the hands
of M. Richard or in the hands of England.<span style=

as valid as ever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Why
should you evade it, sire?<span style=

"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Charles wants to-day what we were
not willing to grant him ten years ago; but that was foreseen and
provided against.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You are
the ally of England, sire, and not of Charles II.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was doubtless wrong, from a
family point of view, to sign a treaty with a man who had cut off
the head of the king your father's brother-in-law, and to
contract an alliance with a parliament which they call yonder the
Rump Parliament; it was unbecoming, I acknowledge, but it was not
unskillful from a political point of view, since, thanks to that
treaty, I saved your majesty, then a minor, the trouble and
danger of a foreign war, which the Fronde - you remember the
Fronde, sire?" - the young king hung his head - "which the Fronde
might have fatally complicated.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And thus I prove to your majesty
that to change our plan now, without warning our allies, would be
at once unskillful and dishonest.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We should make war with the
aggression on our side; we should make it, deserving to have it
made against us; and we should have the appearance of fearing it
whilst provoking it, for a permission granted to five hundred
men, to two hundred men, to fifty men, to ten men, is still a
permission.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> One
Frenchman, that is the nation; one uniform, that is the army.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Suppose, sire, for
example, that you should have war with Holland, which, sooner or
later, will certainly happen; or with Spain, which will perhaps
ensue if your marriage fails" (Mazarin stole a furtive glance at
the king), "and there are a thousand causes that might yet make
your marriage fail, - well, would you approve of England's
sending to the United Provinces or to Spain a regiment, a
company, a squadron even, of English gentlemen?<span style=

within the limits of their treaty of alliance?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis listened; it
seemed so strange to him that Mazarin should invoke good faith,
and he the author of so many political tricks, called
Mazarinades.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "And yet,"
said the king, "without manifest of my authorization, I cannot
prevent gentlemen of my states from passing over into England, if
such should be their good pleasure."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You should compel them

enemies in a allied country."</p>

cardinal, you who are so profound a genius, try if you cannot
find a means to assist this poor king, without compromising
ourselves."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And that is exactly
what I am not willing to do, my dear sire," said Mazarin.<span

exactly according to my wishes, she could not act better than she
does; if I directed the policy of England from this place, I
should not direct it otherwise.<span style=

it is true, sire; you must confess that.<span style=

possibility of breaking your word, and evading the treaty - such
a thing as sometimes happens, but that is when some great
interest is to be promoted by it, or when the treaty is found to
be too troublesome - well, you will authorize the engagement
asked of you: France - her banner, which is the same thing - will
cross the Straits and will fight; France will be conquered."</p>

out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Cromwell has thus

conditions of success which always accompany an unforeseen
event.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That is Monk,
sire, of whom, perhaps, you have never even heard - of whom,
perhaps, you did not even know the name, before your brother,
Charles II., who knows what he is, pronounced it before you.<span

tenacity, the two only things against which intelligence and
ardor are blunted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Sire,
I had ardor when I was young; I always was intelligent.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I may safely boast of it,
because I am reproached with it.<span style=

qualities, since, from the son of a fisherman of Piscina, I have
become prime minister to the king of France; and in that position
your majesty will perhaps acknowledge I have rendered some
service to the throne of your majesty.<span style=

Monsieur le Prince - well, we should have been ruined.<span

sire, you will fall into the talons of this politic soldier.<span

should stop at an idea, and, in spite of myself, should pursue
that idea.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Since that man

of this devotion, I am not the dupe.<span style=

operations; and his work must be accomplished; - so I believe -

from habit - I believe that Monk is keeping on friendly terms
with the parliament till the day comes for dispersing it.<span

they are to fight against Monk.<span style=

against Monk, sire; for Monk would beat us, and I should never
console myself after being beaten by Monk.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I should say to myself, Monk has
foreseen that victory ten years.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> For God's sake, sire, out of
friendship for you, if not out of consideration for himself, let
Charles II. keep quiet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Your majesty will give him a little income here; give him one of
your ch&acirc;teaux.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Yes,
yes - wait awhile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But I
forget the treaty - that famous treaty of which we were just now
speaking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Your majesty
has not even the right to give him a ch&acirc;teau."</p>

him to leave France even.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
It was on this account we forced him to quit you, and yet here he
is again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Sire, I hope
you will give your brother to understand that he cannot remain
with us; that it is impossible he should be allowed to compromise
us; or I myself - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Enough, my lord," said
Louis XIV., rising.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "In
refusing me a million, perhaps you may be right; your millions
are your own.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In refusing
me two hundred gentlemen, you are still further in the right; for
you are prime minister, and you have, in the eyes of France, the
responsibility of peace and war.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But that you should pretend to
prevent me, who am king, from extending my hospitality to the
grandson of Henry IV., to my cousin-german, to the companion of
my childhood - there your power stops, and there begins my
will."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire," said Mazarin,
delighted at being let off so cheaply, and who had, besides, only
fought so earnestly to arrive at that, - "sire, I shall always
bend before the will of my king.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Let my king, then, keep near him, or
in one of his ch&acirc;teaux, the king of England; let Mazarin
know it, but let not the minister know it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Good-night, my lord,"
said Louis XIV., "I go away in despair."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

is all I desire, sire," replied Mazarin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king made no answer,
and retired quite pensive, convinced, not of all Mazarin had told
him, but of one thing which he took care not to mention to him;
and that was, that it was necessary for him to study seriously
both his own affairs and those of Europe, for he found them very
difficult and very obscure.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis found the king of England
seated in the same place where he had left him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On perceiving him, the English
prince arose; but at the first glance he saw discouragement
written in dark letters upon his cousin's brow.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then, speaking first, as if to
facilitate the painful avowal that Louis had to make to him,
-</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Whatever it may be,"
said he, "I shall never forget all the kindness, all the
friendship you have exhibited towards me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Alas!" replied Louis,
in a melancholy tone, "only barren good-will, my brother."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Charles II. became
extremely pale; he passed his cold hand over his brow, and
struggled for a few instants against a faintness that made him
tremble.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I understand,"
said he at last; "no more hope!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis seized the hand of
Charles II. "Wait, my brother," said he; "precipitate nothing;
everything may change; hasty resolutions ruin all causes; add
another year of trial, I implore you, to the years you have
already undergone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You
have, to induce you to act now rather than at another time,
neither occasion nor opportunity.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Come with me, my brother; I will
give you one of my residences, whichever you prefer, to
inhabit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I, with you,
will keep my eyes upon events; we will prepare.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Come, then, my brother, have
courage!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Charles II. withdrew his
hand from that of the king, and drawing back, to salute him with
more ceremony, "With all my heart, thanks!" replied he, "sire;
but I have prayed without success to the greatest king on earth;
now I will go and ask a miracle of God."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he went out without being
willing to hear any more, his head carried loftily, his hand
trembling, with a painful contraction of his noble countenance,
and that profound gloom which, finding no more hope in the world
of men, appeared to go beyond it, and ask it in worlds
unknown.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The officer of
musketeers, on seeing him pass by thus pale, bowed almost to his
knees as he saluted him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
He then took a flambeau, called two musketeers, and descended the
deserted staircase with the unfortunate king, holding in his left
hand his hat, the plume of which swept the steps.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Arrived at the door, the musketeer
asked the king which way he was going, that he might direct the
musketeers.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur," replied
Charles II., in a subdued voice, "you who have known my father,
say, did you ever pray for him?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If you have done so, do not forget
me in your prayers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now,
I am going alone, and beg of you not to accompany me, or have me
accompanied any further."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The officer bowed and
sent away the musketeers into the interior of the palace.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But he himself remained an
instant under the porch watching the departing Charles II., till
he was lost in the turn of the next street.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "To him as to his father formerly,"
murmured he, "Athos, if he were here, would say with reason, -
'Salute fallen majesty!'"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Then, reascending the staircase: "Oh! the vile service that I
follow!" said he at every step.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Oh! my pitiful master!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Life thus carried on is no longer
tolerable, and it is at length time that I should do
something!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No more
generosity, no more energy!<span style=

entering the ante-chamber, "why are you all looking at me
so?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Extinguish these
torches and return to your posts.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Ah! you were guarding me?<span

not, worthy fellows?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Brave fools!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am not the
Duc de Guise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Begone!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They will not
assassinate me in the little passage.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Besides," added he, in a low voice,
"that would be a resolution, and no resolutions have been formed
since Monsieur le Cardinal Richelieu died.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now, with all his faults, that was a
man!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is settled:
to-morrow I will throw my cassock to the nettles."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Then, reflecting: "No,"
said he, "not yet!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have

it, shall be the last, <i style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

speaking when a voice issued from the king's chamber.<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

interims?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

sire, but for twenty or thirty men who rest out of a hundred and
twenty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the Louvre it

me, seeing that I am not accustomed to it."</p>

conceal the inclination to yawn, that your majesty looked with
eloquent supplications, first to his eminence, and then at her

it might have been said to be the proud and energetic profile of
the eagle facing the sun.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>

as M. Daangeau himself could have done - I heard him, and I know
the meaning of his words.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
'To-morrow morning,' said he, 'they will pass opposite the bridge

cause of this order - 'Monsieur the lieutenant of my musketeers,

said, - 'Monsieur the lieutenant of my musketeers, to-morrow, at

I, humble as I am, have in my possession, while it is in
action.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And how do I get
it?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Because I have good

allow him to marry her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>

whether such a marriage, contracted against her will, would be
valid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh, if I were but
twenty-five!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If I had by
my side those I no longer have!<span style=

France with Spain, and I would make a queen after my own
fashion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But let that
pass."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And the lieutenant
snapped his fingers in disdain.</p>

T</span>he sun had scarcely shed its first beams on the majestic
trees of the park and the lofty turrets of the castle, when the
young king, who had been awake more than two hours, possessed by
the sleeplessness of love, opened his shutters himself, and cast
an inquiring look into the courts of the sleeping palace.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He saw that it was the hour
agreed upon: the great court clock pointed to a quarter past
four.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He did not disturb
his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>valet de chambre</i>,
who was sleeping soundly at some distance; he dressed himself,
and the valet, in a great fright, sprang up, thinking he had been
deficient in his duty; but the king sent him back again,
commanding him to preserve the most absolute silence.<span style=

staircase, went out at a lateral door, and perceived at the end

could not be recognized in his cloak and slouched hat.<span

that of a rich citizen, it offered nothing remarkable to the most
experienced eye.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis
took the bridle: the officer held the stirrup without
dismounting, and asked his majesty's orders in a low voice.</p>

sire," replied the officer, fully instructed in the object of his
search.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He put his horse
to the trot, and rode sharply on in the direction pointed out by
the king.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But he had
scarcely gone five hundred paces when he saw four mules, and then
a carriage, loom up from behind a little hill.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Behind this carriage came
another.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It required only
one glance to assure him that these were the equipages he was in
search of; he therefore turned his bridle, and rode back to the
king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire," said he, "here
are the carriages.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
first, as you said, contains two ladies with their <i style=

contains the footmen, provisions, and necessaries."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

that is enough to make a musketeer burst with pride."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> He approached the
carriage, and delivered his message gallantly and
intelligently.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There were
two ladies in the carriage: one of great beauty, although rather
thin; the other less favored by nature, but lively, graceful, and
uniting in the delicate lines of her brow all the signs of a
strong will.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Her eyes,
animated and piercing, in particular, spoke more eloquently than
all the amorous phrases in fashion in those days of
gallantry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was to her
D'Artagnan addressed himself, without fear of being mistaken,
although the other was, as we have said, the more handsome of the
two.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Madame," said he, "I am
the lieutenant of the musketeers, and there is on the road a
horseman who awaits you, and is desirous of paying his respects
to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> At these words, the
effect of which he watched closely, the lady with the black eyes
uttered a cry of joy, leant out of the carriage window, and
seeing the cavalier approaching, held out her arms,
exclaiming:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah, my dear sire!" and
the tears gushed from her eyes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The coachman stopped his
team; the women rose in confusion from the back of the carriage,
and the second lady made a slight curtsey, terminated by the most
ironical smile that jealousy ever imparted to the lips of
woman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Marie, dear Marie,"
cried the king, taking the hand of the black-eyed lady in both
his.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And opening the
heavy door himself, he drew her out of the carriage with so much
ardor, that she was in his arms before she touched the
ground.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The lieutenant,
posted on the other side of the carriage, saw and heard all
without being observed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king offered his arm
to Mademoiselle de Mancini, and made a sign to the coachman and
lackeys to proceed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It
was nearly six o'clock; the road was fresh and pleasant; tall
trees with their foliage still inclosed in the golden down of
their buds, let the dew of morning filter from their trembling
branches, like liquid diamonds; the grass was bursting at the
foot of the hedges; the swallows having returned only a few days
since, described their graceful curves between the heavens and
the water; a breeze, laden with the perfumes of the blossoming
woods, sighed along the road, and wrinkled the surface of the
waters of the river; all these beauties of the day, all these
perfumes of the plants, all these aspirations of the earth
towards heaven, intoxicated the two lovers, walking side by side,
leaning upon each other, eyes fixed upon eyes, hand clasping
hand, and who, lingering as by a common desire, did not dare to
speak, they had so much to say.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The officer saw that the
king's horse, in wandering this way and that, annoyed
Mademoiselle de Mancini.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
He took advantage of the pretext of securing the horse to draw
near them, and dismounting, walked between the two horses he led;
he did not lose a single word or gesture of the lovers.<span

who at length began.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

she, "you do not abandon me, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

king; "you see I do not."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I had so often been
told, though, that as soon as we should be separated you would no
longer think of me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

to-day only that you have discovered we are surrounded by people
interested in deceiving us?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But then, sire, this
journey, this alliance with Spain?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They are going to marry you
off!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis hung his
head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the same time
the officer could see the eyes of Marie de Mancini shine in the
sun with the brilliancy of a dagger starting from its
sheath.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "And you have
done nothing in favor of our love?" asked the girl, after a
silence of a moment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! mademoiselle, how
could you believe that?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I
threw myself at the feet of my mother; I begged her, I implored
her; I told her all my hopes of happiness were in you; I even
threatened - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well?" asked Marie,
eagerly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, the queen-mother
wrote to the court of Rome, and received as answer, that a
marriage between us would have no validity, and would be
dissolved by the holy father.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At length, finding there was no hope
for us, I requested to have my marriage with the infanta at least
delayed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And yet that does not
prevent your being on the road to meet her?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "How can I help it?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To my prayers, to my
supplications, to my tears, I received no answer but reasons of
state."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, well?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, what is to be
done, mademoiselle, when so many wills are leagued against
me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> It was now Marie's turn
to hang her head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Then I
must bid you adieu forever," said she.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "You know that I am being exiled;
you know that I am going to be buried alive; you know still more
that they want to marry me off, too."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis became very pale,
and placed his hand upon his heart.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "If I had thought that
my life only had been at stake, I have been so persecuted that I
might have yielded; but I thought yours was concerned, my dear
sire, and I stood out for the sake of preserving your
happiness."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, yes! my happiness,
my treasure!" murmured the king, more gallantly than
passionately, perhaps.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The cardinal might have
yielded," said Marie, "if you had addressed yourself to him, if
you had pressed him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> For
the cardinal to call the king of France his nephew! do you not
perceive, sire?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He would
have made war even for that honor; the cardinal, assured of
governing alone, under the double pretext of having brought up
the king and given his niece to him in marriage - the cardinal
would have fought all antagonists, overcome all obstacles.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh, sire!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I can answer for that.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am a woman, and I see clearly into
everything where love is concerned."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> These words produced a
strange effect upon the king.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Instead of heightening his passion,
they cooled it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He
stopped, and said hastily, -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What is to be said,
mademoiselle?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Everything
has failed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

trust, my dear sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Alas!" said the king,
coloring, "have I a will?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh!" said Mademoiselle
de Mancini mournfully, wounded by that expression.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The king has no will
but that which policy dictates, but that which reasons of state
impose upon him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! it is because you
have no love," cried Mary; "if you loved, sire, you would have a
will."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> On pronouncing these
words, Mary raised her eyes to her lover, whom she saw more pale
and more cast down than an exile who is about to quit his native
land forever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Accuse
me," murmured the king, "but do not say I do not love you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> A long silence followed
these words, which the young king had pronounced with a perfectly
true and profound feeling.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I am unable to think that
to-morrow, and after to-morrow, I shall see you no more; I cannot
think that I am going to end my sad days at a distance from
Paris; that the lips of an old man, of an unknown, should touch
that hand which you hold within yours; no, in truth, I cannot
think of all that, my dear sire, without having my poor heart
burst with despair."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And Marie de Mancini did
shed floods of tears.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On
his part, the king, much affected, carried his handkerchief to
his mouth, and stifled a sob.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "See," said she, "the
carriages have stopped, my sister waits for me, the time is come;
what you are about to decide upon will be decided for life.<span

then, that I should lose you?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You are willing, then, Louis, that
she to whom you have said 'I love you,' should belong to another
than to her king, to her master, to her lover?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh! courage, Louis! courage!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> One word, a single word!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Say 'I will!' and all my life
is enchained to yours, and all my heart is yours forever."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king made no
reply.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mary then looked
at him as Dido looked at &AElig;neas in the Elysian fields,
fierce and disdainful.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Farewell, then," said
she; "farewell life! love! heaven!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And she took a step
away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king detained
her, seizing her hand, which he pressed to his lips, and despair
prevailing over the resolution he appeared to have inwardly
formed, he let fall upon that beautiful hand a burning tear of
regret, which made Mary start, so really had that tear burnt
her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She saw the humid
eyes of the king, his pale brow, his convulsed lips, and cried,
with an accent that cannot be described, -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

king, you weep, and yet I depart!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> As his sole reply, the
king hid his face in his handkerchief.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The officer uttered something so
like a roar that it frightened the horses.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mademoiselle de Mancini, quite
indignant, quitted the king's arm, hastily entered the carriage,
crying to the coachman, "Go on, go on, and quick!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The coachman obeyed,
flogging his mules, and the heavy carriage rocked upon its
creaking axle, whilst the king of France, alone, cast down,
annihilated, did not dare to look either behind or before
him.</p>

the carriage which bore away his mistress; when he had turned and
turned again a hundred times to the same side and had at length
succeeded in somewhat calming the agitation of his heart and
thoughts, he recollected that he was not alone.<span style=

pushed on sharply, the lieutenant followed him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the bridge Louis turned around
for the last time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
lieutenant, patient as a god who has eternity behind and before
him, still hoped for a return of energy.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But it was groundless, nothing
appeared.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis gained
the street which led to the castle, and entered as seven was
striking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When the king
had returned, and the musketeer, who saw everything, had seen a
corner of the tapestry over the cardinal's window lifted up, he
breathed a profound sigh, like a man unloosed from the tightest
bonds, and said in a low voice:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

hope that it is over."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

gentleman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Please to

he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

"let him come in."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

entered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king made a
sign, and the gentleman and the valet retired.<span style=

until they had shut the door, and when the tapestries had fallen
behind them, - "You remind me by your presence, monsieur, of
something I had forgotten to recommend to you, that is to say,
the most absolute discretion."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! sire, why does your
majesty give yourself the trouble of making me such a

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The officer bowed.<span

to say to me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, monsieur; you may
retire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Shall I obtain
permission not to do so till I have spoken to the king,
sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What do you have to say
to me?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Explain yourself,
monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, a thing without
importance to you, but which interests me greatly.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Pardon me, then, for speaking of
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Without urgency,
without necessity, I never would have done it, and I would have
disappeared, mute and insignificant as I always have been."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "How!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Disappeared!<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, in a word," said
the officer, "I am come to ask for my discharge from your
majesty's service."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king made a movement
of surprise, but the officer remained as motionless as a
statue.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your discharge - yours,
monsieur? and for how long a time, I pray?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why, forever,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What, you are desirous
of quitting my service, monsieur?" said Louis, with an expression
that revealed something more than surprise.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, I regret to say
that I am."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is so, however,
sire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am getting old; I
have worn harness now thirty-five years; my poor shoulders are
tired; I feel that I must give place to the young.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I don't belong to this age; I have
still one foot in the old one; it results that everything is
strange in my eyes, everything astonishes and bewilders me.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In short, I have the honor to
ask your majesty for my discharge."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur," said the
king, looking at the officer, who wore his uniform with an ease
that would have caused envy in a young man, "you are stronger and
more vigorous than I am."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh!" replied the
officer, with an air of false modesty, "your majesty says so
because I still have a good eye and a tolerably firm foot -
because I can still ride a horse, and my mustache is black; but,
sire, vanity of vanities all that - illusions all that -
appearance, smoke, sire!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
I have still a youthful air, it is true, but I feel old, and
within six months I am certain I shall be broken down, gouty,
impotent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Therefore,
then, sire - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur," interrupted
the king, "remember your words of yesterday.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You said to me in this very place
where you now are, that you were endowed with the best health of
any man in France; that fatigue was unknown to you! that you did
not mind spending whole days and nights at your post.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Did you tell me that, monsieur, or
not?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Try and recall,
monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The officer sighed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Sire," said he, "old age is
boastful; and it is pardonable for old men to praise themselves
when others no longer do it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is very possible I said that; but
the fact is, sire, I am very much fatigued, an request permission
to retire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur," said the
king, advancing towards the officer with a gesture full of
majesty, "you are not assigning me the true reason.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You wish to quit my service, it may
be true, but you disguise from me the motive of your
retreat."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, believe that -
"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I believe what I see,
monsieur; I see a vigorous, energetic man, full of presence of
mind, the best soldier in France, perhaps; and this personage
cannot persuade me the least in the world that he stands in need
of rest."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! sire," said the
lieutenant, with bitterness, "what praise!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Indeed, your majesty confounds
me!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Energetic, vigorous,
brave, intelligent, the best soldier in the army!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But, sire, your majesty exaggerates
my small portion of merit to such a point, that however good an
opinion I may have of myself, I do not recognize myself; in truth
I do not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If I were vain
enough to believe only half of your majesty's words, I should
consider myself a valuable, indispensable man.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I should say that a servant
possessed of such brilliant qualities was a treasure beyond all
price.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now, sire, I have
been all my life - I feel bound to say it - except at the present
time, appreciated, in my opinion, much below my value.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I therefore repeat, your
majesty exaggerates."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king knitted his
brow, for he saw a bitter raillery beneath the words of the
officer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Come,
monsieur," said he, "let us meet the question frankly.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Are you dissatisfied with my
service, say?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No
evasions; speak boldly, frankly - I command you to do so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The officer, who had
been twisting his hat about in his hands, with an embarrassed
air, for several minutes, raised his head at these words.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Oh! sire," said he, "that
puts me a little more at my ease.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To a question put so frankly, I will
reply frankly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To tell
the truth is a good thing, as much from the pleasure one feels in
relieving one's heart, as on account of the rarity of the
fact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I will speak the
truth, then, to my king, at the same time imploring him to excuse
the frankness of an old soldier."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis looked at his
officer with anxiety, which he manifested by the agitation of his
gesture.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Well, then,
speak," said he, "for I am impatient to hear the truths you have
to tell me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The officer threw his
hat upon a table, and his countenance, always so intelligent and
martial, assumed, all at once, a strange character of grandeur
and solemnity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Sire,"
said he, "I quit the king's service because I am
dissatisfied.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The valet,
in these times, can approach his master as respectfully as I do,
can give him an account of his labor, bring back his tools,
return the funds that have been intrusted to him, and say
'Master, my day's work is done.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Pay me, if you please, and let us
part.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur! monsieur!"
exclaimed the king, crimson with rage.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! sire," replied the
officer, bending his knee for a moment, "never was servant more
respectful than I am before your majesty; only you commanded me
to tell the truth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now I
have begun to tell it, it must come out, even if you command me
to hold my tongue."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> There was so much
resolution expressed in the deep-sunk muscles of the officer's
countenance, that Louis XIV. had no occasion to tell him to
continue; he continued, therefore, whilst the king looked at him
with a curiosity mingled with admiration.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, I have, as I have
said, now served the house of France thirty-five years; few
people have worn out so many swords in that service as I have,
and the swords I speak of were good swords, too, sire.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I was a boy, ignorant of
everything except courage, when the king your father guessed that
there was a man in me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I
was a man, sire, when the Cardinal de Richelieu, who was a judge
of manhood, discovered an enemy in me.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Sire, the history of that enmity
between the ant and the lion may be read from the first to the
last line, in the secret archives of your family.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If ever you feel an inclination to
know it, do so, sire; the history is worth the trouble - it is I
who tell you so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You will
there read that the lion, fatigued, harassed, out of breath, at
length cried for quarter, and the justice must be rendered him to
say, that he gave as much as he required.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh! those were glorious times, sire,
strewed over with battles like one of Tasso's or Ariosto's
epics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The wonders of
those times, to which the people of ours would refuse belief,
were every-day occurrences.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> For five years together, I was a
hero every day; at least, so I was told by persons of judgment;
and that is a long period for heroism, trust me, sire, a period
of five years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Nevertheless, I have faith in what these people told me, for the
were good judges.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They
were named M. de Richelieu, M. de Buckingham, M. de Beaufort, M.
de Retz, a mighty genius himself in street warfare, - in short,
the king, Louis XIII., and even the queen, your noble mother, who
one day condescended to say, '<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Thank you</i>.'<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I don't know what service I had had
the good fortune to render her.<span style=

boldly; but what I relate to you, as I have already had the honor
to tell your majesty, is history."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

and threw himself violently on a chair.</p>

your majesty," said the lieutenant.<span style=

steel; she wounds those whom she attacks, and sometimes him who
speaks her."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, monsieur," replied
the king: "I bade you speak - speak then."</p>

the king and the cardinal, came the service of the regency, sire;

first time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The men began
to diminish in stature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I
have, nevertheless, led your majesty's musketeers on some
perilous occasions, which stand upon the orders of the day of the
company.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mine was a
beautiful luck at that time.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I was the favorite of M. de
Mazarin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Lieutenant here!
lieutenant there! lieutenant to the right! lieutenant to the
left!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There was not a
buffet dealt in France, of which your humble servant did not have
the dealing; but soon France was not enough.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The cardinal sent me to England on
Cromwell's account; another gentleman who was not over gentle, I
assure you, sire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I had
the honor of knowing him, and I was well able to appreciate
him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A great deal was
promised me on account of that mission.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> So, as I did much more than I had
been bidden to do, I was generously paid, for I was at length
appointed captain of the musketeers; that is to say, the most
envied position in court, which takes precedence over the
marshals of France, and justly; for who says captain of the
musketeers says the flower of chivalry and king of the
brave."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

master by condemning to want another king, his equal.<span style=

not the gentleman, whose name I then demanded, called M.
d'Artagnan? say, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your majesty has a good
memory," replied the officer, coldly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You see, then,"
continued the king, "if I have such remembrances of my childhood,
what an amount I may gather in the age of reason."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your majesty has been
richly endowed by God," said the officer, in the same tone.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Come, Monsieur
d'Artagnan," continued Louis, with feverish agitation, "ought you
not to be patient as I am?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Ought you not to do as I do?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Come!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And what do you do,
sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I wait."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your majesty may do so,
because you are young; but I, sire, have not time to wait; old
age is at my door, and death is behind it, looking into the very
depths of my house.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Your
majesty is beginning life, its future is full of hope and
fortune; but I, sire, I am on the other side of the horizon, and
we are so far from each other, that I should never have time to
wait till your majesty came up to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis made another turn
in his apartment, still wiping the moisture from his brow, in a
manner that would have terrified his physicians, if his
physicians had witnessed the state his majesty was in.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is very well,
monsieur," said Louis XIV., in a sharp voice; "you are desirous
of having your discharge, and you shall have it.<span style=

rank of lieutenant of the musketeers?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

your majesty's feet, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

king, with a violent effort, "I think you are losing a good

sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

such another?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, sire!<span style=

the world; therefore will I never again take service with any
other king upon earth, and will never again have other master
than myself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You say so?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

word, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan bowed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And you know I have a
good memory," said the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, sire; and yet I
should desire that that memory should fail your majesty in this
instance, in order that you might forget all the miseries I have
been forced to spread before your eyes.<span style=

poor and the mean, that I hope - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My majesty, monsieur,
will act like the sun, which looks upon all, great and small,

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

hoarse sob, which was lost in his throat, passed quickly into the

Thanks to your good counsels, and, above all, thanks to your
firmness, I have succeeded in overcoming a weakness unworthy of a

arranged my destiny to allow gratitude not to stop me at the

LOUIS."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king, after
reperusing the letter, sealed it himself.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At Mazarin's door he
found Bernouin waiting with anxiety.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well?" asked the

that his majesty - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "As first minister, it
belongs to the duties of our charge to know everything.<span

implores, I presume."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I don't know, but he
sighed frequently whilst he was writing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, yes, yes; we
understand all that; people sigh sometimes from happiness as well
as from grief, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And yet the king did
not look very happy when he returned, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You did not see
clearly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Besides, you
only saw his majesty on his return, for he was only accompanied
by the lieutenant of the guards.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But I had his eminence's telescope;
I looked through it when he was tired, and I am sure they both
wept."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well! was it for
happiness they wept?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, but for love, and
they vowed to each other a thousand tendernesses, which the king
asks no better to keep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Now this letter is a beginning of the execution."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And what does his
eminence think of this love, which is, by the bye, no secret to
anybody?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Bernouin took the
gentleman by the arm, and whilst ascending the staircase, - "In
confidence," said he, in a low voice, "his eminence looks for
success in the affair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I
know very well we shall have war with Spain; but, bah! war will
please the nobles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> My
lord cardinal, besides, can endow his niece royally, nay, more
than royally.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There will
be money, festivities, and fire-works - everybody will be
delighted."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, for my part,"
replied the gentleman, shaking his head, "it appears to me that
this letter is very light to contain all that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My friend," replied
Bernouin, "I am certain of what I tell you.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M. d'Artagnan related all that
passed to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ay, ay! and what did he
tell you?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Let us
hear."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I accosted him by
asking him, on the part of the cardinal, if there were any news,
without discovering my designs, observe, for M. d'Artagnan is a
cunning hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> 'My dear
Monsieur Bernouin,' he replied, 'the king is madly in love with
Mademoiselle de Mancini, that is all I have to tell you.'<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And then I asked him: 'Do you
think, to such a degree that it will urge him to act contrary to
the designs of his eminence?'<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> 'Ah! don't ask me,' said he; 'I
think the king capable of anything; he has a will of iron, and
what he wills he wills in earnest.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If he takes it into his head to
marry Mademoiselle de Mancini, he will marry her, depend upon
it.'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And thereupon he
left me and went straight to the stables, took a horse, saddled
it himself, jumped upon its back, and set off as if the devil
were at his heels."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "So that you believe,
then - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I believe that monsieur
the lieutenant of the guards knew more than he was willing to
say."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In you opinion, then,
M. d'Artagnan - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Is gone, according to
all probability, after the exiles, to carry out all that can
facilitate the success of the king's love."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Chatting thus, the two
confidants arrived at the door of his eminence's apartment.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His eminence's gout had left
him; he was walking about his chamber in a state of great
anxiety, listening at doors and looking out of windows.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Bernouin entered, followed by
the gentleman, who had orders from the king to place the letter
in the hands of the cardinal himself.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mazarin took the letter, but before
opening it, he got up a ready smile, a smile of circumstance,
able to throw a veil over emotions of whatever sort they might
be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> So prepared, whatever
was the impression received from the letter, no reflection of
that impression was allowed to transpire upon his
countenance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well," said he, when he
had read and reread the letter, "very well, monsieur.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Inform the king that I thank him for
his obedience to the wishes of the queen-mother, and that I will
do everything for the accomplishment of his will."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The gentleman left the
room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The door had
scarcely closed before the cardinal, who had no mask for
Bernouin, took off that which had so recently covered his face,
and with a most dismal expression, - "Call M. de Brienne," said
he.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Five minutes
afterward the secretary entered.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur," said
Mazarin, "I have just rendered a great service to the monarchy,
the greatest I have ever rendered it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You will carry this letter, which
proves it, to her majesty the queen-mother, and when she shall
have returned it to you, you will lodge it in portfolio B., which
is filed with documents and papers relative to my ministry."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Brienne went as desired,
and, as the letter was unsealed, did not fail to read it on his
way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There is likewise no
doubt that Bernouin, who was on good terms with everybody,
approached so near to the secretary as to be able to read the
letter over his shoulder; so that the news spread with such
activity through the castle, that Mazarin might have feared it
would reach the ears of the queen-mother before M. de Brienne
could convey Louis XIV.'s letter to her.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A moment after orders were given for
departure, and M. de Cond&eacute; having been to pay his respects
to the king on his pretended rising, inscribed the city of
Poitiers upon his tablets, as the place of sojourn and rest for
their majesties.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Thus in a few instants
was unraveled an intrigue which had covertly occupied all the
diplomacies of Europe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It
had nothing, however, very clear as a result, but to make a poor
lieutenant of musketeers lose his commission and his
fortune.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is true, that
in exchange he gained his liberty.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We shall soon know how M. d'Artagnan
profited by this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> For the
moment, if the reader will permit us, we shall return to the
hostelry of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>les Medici</i>,
of which one of the windows opened at the very moment the orders
were given for the departure of the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The window that opened
was that of one of the rooms of Charles II.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The unfortunate prince had passed
the night in bitter reflections, his head resting on his hands,
and his elbows on the table, whilst Parry, infirm and old,
wearied in body and in mind, had fallen asleep in a corner.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A singular fortune was that of
this faithful servant, who saw beginning for the second
generation the fearful series of misfortunes which had weighed so
heavily on the first.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
When Charles II. had well thought over the fresh defeat he had
experienced, when he perfectly comprehended the complete
isolation into which he had just fallen, on seeing his fresh hope
left behind him, he was seized as with a vertigo, and sank back
into the large armchair in which he was seated.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then God took pity on the unhappy
prince, and sent to console him sleep, the innocent brother of
death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He did not wake
till half-past six, that is to say, till the sun shone brightly
into his chamber, and Parry, motionless with fear of waking him,
was observing with profound grief the eyes of the young man
already red with wakefulness, and his cheeks pale with suffering
and privations.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> At length the noise of
some heavy carts descending towards the Loire awakened
Charles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He arose, looked
around him like a man who has forgotten everything, perceived
Parry, shook him by the hand, and commanded him to settle the
reckoning with Master Cropol&eacute;.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Master Cropol&eacute;, being called
upon to settle his account with Parry, acquitted himself, it must
be allowed, like an honest man; he only made his customary
remark, that the two travelers had eaten nothing, which had the
double disadvantage of being humiliating for his kitchen, and of
forcing him to ask payment for a repast not consumed, but not the
less lost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Parry had
nothing to say to the contrary, and paid.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I hope," said the king,
"it has not been the same with the horses.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I don't see that they have eaten at
your expense, and it would be a misfortune for travelers like us,
who have a long journey to make, to have our horses fail us."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> But Cropol&eacute;, at
this doubt, assumed his majestic air, and replied that the
stables of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>les Medici</i>
were not less hospitable than its refectory.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king mounted his
horse; his old servant did the same, and both set out towards
Paris, without meeting a single person on their road, in the
streets or the faubourgs of the city.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> For the prince the blow was the more
severe, as it was a fresh exile.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The unfortunates cling to the
smallest hopes, as the happy do to the greatest good; and when
they are obliged to quit the place where that hope has soothed
their hearts, they experience the mortal regret which the
banished man feels when he places his foot upon the vessel which
is to bear him into exile.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It appears that the heart already
wounded so many times suffers from the least scratch; it appears
that it considers as a good the momentary absence of evil, which
is nothing but the absence of pain; and that God, into the most
terrible misfortunes, has thrown hope as the drop of water which
the rich sinner in hell entreated of Lazarus.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> For one instant even the
hope of Charles II. had been more than a fugitive joy; - that was
when he found himself so kindly welcomed by his brother king;
then it had taken a form that had become a reality; then, all at
once, the refusal of Mazarin had reduced the fictitious reality
to the state of a dream.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
This promise of Louis XIV., so soon retracted, had been nothing
but a mockery; a mockery like his crown - like his scepter - like
his friends - like all that had surrounded his royal childhood,
and which had abandoned his proscribed youth.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mockery! everything was a mockery
for Charles II. except the cold, black repose promised by
death.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Such were the ideas of
the unfortunate prince while sitting listlessly upon his horse,
to which he abandoned the reins: he rode slowly along beneath the
warm May sun, in which the somber misanthropy of the exile
perceived a last insult to his grief.</p>

A</span> horseman going rapidly along the road leading towards
Blois, which he had left nearly half an hour before, passed the
two travelers, and, though apparently in haste, raised his hat as
he passed them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king
scarcely observed this young man, who was about twenty-five years
of age, and who, turning round several times, made friendly
signals to a man standing before the gate of a handsome
white-and-red house; that is to say, built of brick and stone,
with a slated roof, situated on the left hand of the road the
prince was traveling.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This man, old, tall, and
thin, with white hair, - we speak of the one standing by the
gate; - this man replied to the farewell signals of the young one
by signs of parting as tender as could have been made by a
father.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The young man
disappeared at the first turn of the road, bordered by fine
trees, and the old man was preparing to return to the house, when
the two travelers, arriving in front of the gate, attracted his
attention.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king, as we have
said, was riding with his head cast down, his arms inert, leaving
his horse to go what pace he liked, whilst Parry, behind him, the
better to imbibe the genial influence of the sun, had taken off
his hat, and was looking about right and left.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His eyes encountered those of the
old man leaning against the gate; the latter, as if struck by
some strange spectacle, uttered an exclamation, and made one step
towards the two travelers.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> From Parry his eyes immediately
turned towards the king, upon whom they rested for an
instant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This
examination, however rapid, was instantly reflected in a visible
manner upon the features of the tall old man.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> For scarcely had he recognized the
younger of the travelers - and we said recognized, for nothing
but a perfect recognition could have explained such an act -
scarcely, we say, had he recognized the younger of the two
travelers, than he clapped his hands together, with respectful
surprise, and, raising his hat from his head, bowed so profoundly
that it might have been said he was kneeling.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This demonstration, however absent,
or rather, however absorbed was the king in his reflections,
attracted his attention instantly; and checking his horse and
turning towards Parry, he exclaimed, "Good God, Parry, who is
that man who salutes me in such a marked manner?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Can he know me, think you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Parry, much agitated and
very pale, had already turned his horse towards the gate.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Ah, sire!" said he, stopping
suddenly at five or six paces' distance from the still bending
old man: "sire, I am seized with astonishment, for I think I
recognize that brave man.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Yes, it must be he!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Will
your majesty permit me to speak to him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Certainly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Can it be you, Monsieur
Grimaud?" asked Parry.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, it is I," replied
the tall old man, drawing himself up, but without losing his
respectful demeanor.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire," then said Parry,
"I was not deceived.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This
good man is the servant of the Comte de la F&egrave;re, and the
Comte de la F&egrave;re, if you remember, is the worthy gentleman
of whom I have so often spoken to your majesty that the
remembrance of him must remain, not only in your mind, but in
your heart."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He who assisted my
father at his last moments?" asked Charles, evidently affected at
the remembrance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The same, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Alas!" said Charles;
and then addressing Grimaud, whose penetrating and intelligent
eyes seemed to search and divine his thoughts. - "My friend,"
said he, "does your master, Monsieur le Comte de la F&egrave;re,
live in this neighborhood?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "There," replied
Grimaud, pointing with his outstretched arm to the white-and-red
house behind the gate.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And is Monsieur le
Comte de la F&egrave;re at home at present?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "At the back, under the
chestnut trees."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Parry," said the king,
"I will not miss this opportunity, so precious for me, to thank
the gentleman to whom our house is indebted for such a noble
example of devotedness and generosity.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Hold my horse, my friend, if you
please."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And, throwing
the bridle to Grimaud, the king entered the abode of Athos, quite
alone, as one equal enters the dwelling of another.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Charles had been informed by the
concise explanation of Grimaud, - "At the back, under the
chestnut trees;" he left, therefore, the house on the left, and
went straight down the path indicated.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The thing was easy; the tops of
those noble trees, already covered with leaves and flowers, rose
above all the rest.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> On arriving under the
lozenges, by turns luminous and dark, which checkered the ground
of this path according as the trees were more or less in leaf,
the young prince perceived a gentleman walking with his arms
behind him, apparently plunged in a deep meditation.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Without doubt, he had often had this
gentleman described to himself, for, without hesitating, Charles
II. walked straight up to him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the sound of his footsteps, the
Comte de la F&egrave;re raised his head, and seeing an unknown
man of noble and elegant carriage coming towards him, he raised
his hat and waited.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At
some paces from him, Charles II. likewise took off his hat.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then, as if in reply to the
comte's mute interrogation, -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur le Comte,"
said he, "I come to discharge a debt towards you.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have, for a long time, had the
expression of a profound gratitude to bring you.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am Charles II., son of Charles
Stuart, who reigned in England, and died on the scaffold."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> On hearing this
illustrious name, Athos felt a kind of shudder creep through his
veins, but at the sight of the young prince standing uncovered
before him, and stretching out his hand towards him, two tears,
for an instant, dimmed his brilliant eyes.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He bent respectfully, but the prince
took him by the hand.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "See how unfortunate I
am, my lord count; it is only due to chance that I have met with
you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Alas!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I ought to have people around me
whom I love and honor, whereas I am reduced to preserve their
services in my heart, and their names in my memory: so that if
your servant had not recognized mine, I should have passed by
your door as by that of a stranger."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is but too true,"
said Athos, replying with his voice to the first part of the
king's speech, and with a bow to the second; "it is but too true,
indeed, that your majesty has seen many evil days."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And the worst, alas!"
replied Charles, "are perhaps still to come."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, let us hope."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Count, count,"
continued Charles, shaking his head, "I entertained hope till
last night, and that of a good Christian, I swear."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Athos looked at the king
as if to interrogate him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, the history is soon
related," said Charles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Proscribed, despoiled, disdained, I resolved, in spite of all my
repugnance, to tempt fortune one last time.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Is it not written above, that, for
our family, all good fortune and all bad fortune shall eternally
come from France?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You
know something of that, monsieur, - you, who are one of the
Frenchmen whom my unfortunate father found at the foot of his
scaffold, on the day of his death, after having found them at his
right hand on the day of battle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire," said Athos
modestly, "I was not alone.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> My companions and I did, under the
circumstances, our duty as gentlemen, and that was all.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Your majesty was about to do
me the honor to relate - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is true, I had the
protection, - pardon my hesitation, count, but, for a Stuart,
you, who understand everything, you will comprehend that the word
is hard to pronounce; - I had, I say, the protection of my cousin
the stadtholder of Holland; but without the intervention, or at
least without the authorization of France, the stadtholder would
not take the initiative.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
I came, then, to ask this authorization of the king of France,
who has refused me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The king has refused
you, sire!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

must be rendered to my younger brother Louis; but Monsieur de
Mazarin - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Athos bit his lips.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You perhaps think I
should have expected this refusal?" said the king, who had
noticed the movement.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That was, in truth, my
thought, sire," replied Athos, respectfully; "I know that Italian
of old."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Then I determined to
come to the test, and know at once the last word of my
destiny.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I told my
brother Louis, that, not to compromise either France or Holland,
I would tempt fortune myself in person, as I had already done,
with two hundred gentlemen, if he would give them to me; and a
million, if he would lend it me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, monsieur, I am
suffering at this moment something strange, and that is, the
satisfaction of despair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
There is in certain souls, - and I have just discovered that mine
is of the number,- a real satisfaction in the assurance that all
is lost, and the time is come to yield."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, I hope," said
Athos, "that your majesty is not come to that extremity."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To say so, my lord
count, to endeavor to revive hope in my heart, you must have ill
understood what I have just told you.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I came to Blois to ask of my brother
Louis the alms of a million, with which I had the hopes of
re-establishing my affairs; and my brother Louis has refused
me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You see, then,
plainly, that all is lost."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Will your majesty
permit me to express a contrary opinion?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "How is that,
count?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do you think my
heart of so low an order that I do not know how to face my
position?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, I have always
seen that it was in desperate positions that suddenly the great
turns of fortune have taken place."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Thank you, count: it is
some comfort to meet with a heart like yours; that is to say,
sufficiently trustful in God and in monarchy, never to despair of
a royal fortune, however low it may be fallen.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Unfortunately, my dear count, your
words are like those remedies they call 'sovereign,' and which,
though able to cure curable wounds or diseases, fail against
death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Thank you for your
perseverance in consoling me, count, thanks for your devoted
remembrance, but I know in what I must trust - nothing will save
me now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And see, my
friend, I was so convinced, that I was taking the route of exile,
with my old Parry; I was returning to devour my poignant griefs
in the little hermitage offered me by Holland.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There, believe me, count, all will
soon be over, and death will come quickly; it is called so often
by this body, eaten up by its soul, and by this soul, which
aspires to heaven."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your majesty has a
mother, a sister, and brothers; your majesty is the head of the
family, and ought, therefore, to ask a long life of God, instead
of imploring Him for a prompt death.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Your majesty is an exile, a
fugitive, but you have right on your side; you ought to aspire to
combats, dangers, business, and not to rest in heavens."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Count," said Charles
II., with a smile of indescribable sadness, "have you ever heard
of a king who reconquered his kingdom with one servant the age of
Parry, and with three hundred crowns which that servant carried
in his purse?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, sire; but I have
heard - and that more than once - that a dethroned king has
recovered his kingdom with a firm will, perseverance, some
friends, and a million skillfully employed."</p>

'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But you cannot have
understood me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire," said Athos,
"will your majesty grant me a few minutes, and listen attentively
to what remains for me to say to you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Charles II. looked
earnestly at Athos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Willingly, monsieur," said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Then I will show your
majesty the way," resumed the count, directing his steps towards
the house.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He then
conducted the king to his study, and begged him to be
seated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Sire," said he,
"your majesty just now told me that, in the present state of
England, a million would suffice for the recovery of your
kingdom."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To attempt it at least,
monsieur; and to die as a king if I should not succeed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

your majesty, according to the promise you have made me, have the
goodness to listen to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
what I have to say."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Charles made an affirmative sign with his head.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos walked straight up to the
door, the bolts of which he drew, after looking to see if anybody
was near, and then returned.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Sire," said he, "your majesty has
kindly remembered that I lent assistance to the very noble and
very unfortunate Charles I., when his executioners conducted him
from St. James's to Whitehall."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Speak on,

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "When the king your
father ascended the scaffold, or rather when he passed from his
chamber to the scaffold, on a level with his window, everything
was prepared for his escape.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The executioner was got out of the
way; a hole contrived under the floor of his apartment; I myself
was beneath the funeral vault, which I heard all at once creak
beneath his feet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Parry has related to me
all these terrible details, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

something he had not related to you, sire, for what follows
passed between God, your father, and myself; and never has the
revelation of it been made even to my dearest friends.<span

freedom."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Charles II., turning very pale," but you, count, who know so many
details of this melancholy event, - details which, as you said
just now, have never been revealed to any one, - do you know the
name of that infernal executioner, of that base wretch who
concealed his face that he might assassinate a king with
impunity?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Athos became slightly
pale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "His name?" said
he, "yes, I know it, but cannot tell it."</p>

him, for nobody in England knows his destiny?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

the death of the good?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

after having, as I have said, spoken thus to the masked

stretch out my arms, saying - REMEMBER!'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I was aware," said
Charles, in an agitated voice, "that that was the last word

in a voice choked by emotion, "you are, for me, what an angel
sent from heaven would be, - you are a preserver sent to me from
the tomb of my father himself; but, believe me, for ten years'
civil war has passed over my country, striking down men, tearing
up soil, it is no more probable that gold should remain in the
entrails of the earth, than love in the hearts of my
subjects."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

his majesty buried the million is well known to me, and no one, I

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But what your majesty

that I could succeed in accomplishing?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

would go?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

here, count?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

king, forgetting all royal etiquette and throwing his arms around
the neck of Athos, "you prove to me that there is a God in

unfortunate who groan on the earth."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Athos, exceedingly moved

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

"it is a habit contracted long since, in the service of the queen
your aunt, and of the king your father.<span style=

at the moment your majesty's service calls for it?"</p>

the king.</p>

reflection, - "But no, count, I cannot expose you to such

means of rewarding such services."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Bah!" said Athos,
laughing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Your majesty
is joking; have you not a million? Ah! why am I not possessed of
half such a sum!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I would
already have raised a regiment.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But, thank God!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have still a few rolls of gold and
some family diamonds left.<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

with me hereafter!"</p>

opening a casket, form which he drew both gold and jewels, "you
see, sire, we are too rich.<span style=

in the event of our meeting with thieves."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Joy made the blood rush
to the pale cheeks of Charles II., as he saw Athos's two horses,
led by Grimaud, already booted for the journey, advance towards
the porch.</p>

before the gate, and with a sonorous "<i style=

stable-boys, who, with the gardeners, had formed a circle round
Blaisois, the historian-in-ordinary to the household of the

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> A swarm of eight brisk

himself, "the fellow is unbearable."<span style=

house, turned his horse's head, and set off like a man who has
nothing either annoying or embarrassing in his mind.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When he was at the end of the wall,
and out of sight, - "Well, now, I wonder," said he, breathing
quickly, "whether Athos was at home.<span style=

Melun, in a certain presbytery I am acquainted with.<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Melun, as he had intended.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan was never in
the habit of asking any one on the road for any common
information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> For these
sorts of details, unless in very serious circumstances, he
confided in his perspicacity, which was so seldom at fault, in
his experience of thirty years, and in a great habit of reading
the physiognomies of houses, as well as those of men.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At Melun, D'Artagnan immediately
found the presbytery - a charming house, plastered over red
brick, with vines climbing along the gutters, and a cross, in
carved stone, surmounting the ridge of the roof.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> From the ground-floor of this house
came a noise, or rather a confusion of voices, like the chirping
of young birds when the brood is just hatched under the
down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> One of these voices
was spelling the alphabet distinctly.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A voice thick, yet pleasant, at the
same time scolded the talkers and corrected the faults of the
reader.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan
recognized that voice, and as the window of the ground-floor was
open, he leant down from his horse under the branches and red
fibers of the vine and cried, "Bazin, my dear Bazin! good-day to
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> A short, fat man, with a
flat face, a cranium ornamented with a crown of gray hairs, cut
short, in imitation of a tonsure, and covered with an old black
velvet cap, arose as soon as he heard D'Artagnan - we ought not
to say <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>arose</i>, but <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>bounded up</i>.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In fact, Bazin bounded up, carrying
with him his little low chair, which the children tried to take
away, with battles more fierce than those of the Greeks
endeavoring to recover the body of Patroclus from the hands of
the Trojans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Bazin did
more than bound; he let fall both his alphabet and his
ferule.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "You!" said he;
"you, Monsieur D'Artagnan?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

D'Artagnan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Bazin

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

a diocese?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why, where can you come
from," said Bazin, rather irreverently, "that you don't know
that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My dear Bazin, we
pagans, we men of the sword, know very well when a man is made a
colonel, or <i style=

of France; but if he be made a bishop, arch-bishop, or pope -
devil take me if the news reaches us before the three quarters of
the earth have had the advantage of it!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Hush! hush!" said
Bazin, opening his eyes: "do not spoil these poor children, in
whom I am endeavoring to inculcate such good principles."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In fact, the children had
surrounded D'Artagnan, whose horse, long sword, spurs, and
martial air they very much admired.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But above all, they admired his
strong voice; so that, when he uttered his oath, the whole school
cried out, "The devil take me!" with fearful bursts of laughter,
shouts, and bounds, which delighted the musketeer, and bewildered
the old pedagogue.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "There!" said he, "hold
your tongues, you brats!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
You have come, M. d'Artagnan, and all my good principles fly
away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> With you, as usual,
comes disorder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Babel is

"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Ah! the wild little wretches!"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And the worthy Bazin
distributed right and left blows which increased the cries of his
scholars by changing the nature of them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

"you will no longer decoy any one here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

D'Artagnan, with a smile which made a shudder creep over the

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He is right there,"
said D'Artagnan, looking attentively at the house, the aspect of
which announced solitude.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

have written you an account of his promotion."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh," said Bazin,
without hesitation, "now that monseigneur is a bishop, I shall
soon have my orders, or at least my dispensations."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he rubbed his hands.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Decidedly," said
D'Artagnan to himself, "there will be no means of uprooting these
people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Get me some
supper, Bazin."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "With pleasure,
monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A fowl, a <i style=

wine."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "This is Saturday night,
monsieur - it is a day of abstinence."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I have a dispensation,"
said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Bazin looked at him
suspiciously.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah, ah, master
hypocrite!" said the musketeer, "for whom do you take me?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If you, who are the valet,
hope for dispensation to commit a crime, shall not I, the friend
of your bishop, have dispensation for eating meat at the call of
my stomach?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Make yourself
agreeable with me, Bazin, or by heavens!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I will complain to the king, and you
shall never confess.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now
you know that the nomination of bishops rests with the king, - I
have the king, I am the stronger."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Bazin smiled
hypocritically.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Ah, but
we have monsieur le surintendant," said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And you laugh at the
king, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Bazin made no reply; his
smile was sufficiently eloquent.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My supper," said
D'Artagnan, "it is getting towards seven o'clock."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Bazin turned round and
ordered the eldest of the pupils to inform the cook.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the meantime, D'Artagnan surveyed
the presbytery.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Phew!" said he,
disdainfully, "monseigneur lodged his grandeur very meanly
here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "We have the
Ch&acirc;teau de Vaux," said Bazin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Which is perhaps equal
to the Louvre?" said D'Artagnan, jeeringly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Which is better,"
replied Bazin, with the greatest coolness imaginable.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah, ah!" said
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> He would perhaps have
prolonged the discussion, and maintained the superiority of the
Louvre, but the lieutenant perceived that his horse remained
fastened to the bars of a gate.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The devil!" said
he.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Get my horse looked
after; your master the bishop has none like him in his
stables."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Bazin cast a sidelong
glance at the horse, and replied, "Monsieur le surintendant gave
him four from his own stables; and each of the four is worth four
of yours."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The blood mounted to the
face of D'Artagnan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His
hand itched and his eye glanced over the head of Bazin, to select
the place upon which he should discharge his anger.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But it passed away; reflection came,
and D'Artagnan contented himself with saying, -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The devil! the
devil!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have done well
to quit the service of the king.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Tell me, worthy Master Bazin," added
he, "how many musketeers does monsieur le surintendant retain in
his service?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He could have all there
are in the kingdom with his money," replied Bazin, closing his
book, and dismissing the boys with some kindly blows of his
cane.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The devil! the devil!"
repeated D'Artagnan, once more, as if to annoy the
pedagogue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But as supper
was now announced, he followed the cook, who introduced him into
the refectory, where it awaited him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan placed himself at the
table, and began a hearty attack upon his fowl.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It appears to me," said
D'Artagnan, biting with all his might at the tough fowl they had
served up to him, and which they had evidently forgotten to
fatten, - "it appears that I have done wrong in not seeking
service with that master yonder.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A powerful noble this intendant,
seemingly!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In good truth,
we poor fellows know nothing at the court, and the rays of the
sun prevent our seeing the large stars, which are also suns, at a
little greater distance from our earth, - that is all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> As D'Artagnan delighted,
both from pleasure and system, in making people talk about things
which interested him, he fenced in his best style with Master
Bazin, but it was pure loss of time; beyond the tiresome and
hyperbolical praises of monsieur le surintendant of the finances,
Bazin, who, on his side, was on his guard, afforded nothing but
platitudes to the curiosity of D'Artagnan, so that our musketeer,
in a tolerably bad humor, desired to go to bed as soon as he had
supped.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan was
introduced by Bazin into a mean chamber, in which there was a
poor bed; but D'Artagnan was not fastidious in that respect.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had been told that Aramis
had taken away the key of his own private apartment, and as he
knew Aramis was a very particular man, and had generally many
things to conceal in his apartment, he had not been
surprised.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He, therefore,
although it seemed comparatively even harder, attacked the bed as
bravely as he had done the fowl; and, as he had as good an
inclination to sleep as he had had to eat, he took scarcely
longer time to be snoring harmoniously than he had employed in
picking the last bones of the bird.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Since he was no longer
in the service of any one, D'Artagnan had promised himself to
indulge in sleeping as soundly as he had formerly slept lightly;
but with whatever good faith D'Artagnan had made himself this
promise, and whatever desire he might have to keep it
religiously, he was awakened in the middle of the night by a loud
noise of carriages, and servants on horseback. <span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A sudden illumination flashed over
the walls of his chamber; he jumped out of bed and ran to the
window in his shirt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Can
the king be coming this way?" he thought, rubbing his eyes; "in
truth, such a suite can only be attached to royalty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Vive le monsieur le
surintendant!</i>" cried, or rather vociferated, from a window on
the ground-floor, a voice which he recognized as Bazin's, who at
the same time waved a handkerchief with one hand, and held a
large candle in the other.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan then saw something like a
brilliant human form leaning out of the principal carriage; at
the same time loud bursts of laughter, caused, no doubt, by the
strange figure of Bazin, and issuing from the same carriage,
left, as it were, a train of joy upon the passage of the rapid <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cort&eacute;ge</i>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I might easily see it
was not the king," said D'Artagnan; "people don't laugh so
heartily when the king passes.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hol&agrave;</i> , Bazin!" cried he
to his neighbor, three-quarters of whose body still hung out of
the window, to follow the carriage with his eyes as long as he
could.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "What is all that
about?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is M. Fouquet," said
Bazin, in a patronizing tone.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And all those
people?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is the court of M.
Fouquet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, oh!" said
D'Artagnan; "what would M. de Mazarin say to that if he heard
it?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he returned to
his bed, asking himself how Aramis always contrived to be
protected by the most powerful personages in the kingdom.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Is it that he has more luck
than I, or that I am a greater fool than he?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Bah!"<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That was the concluding word by the
aid of which D'Artagnan, having become wise, now terminated every
thought and every period of his style.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Formerly he said, "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mordioux!</i>" which was a prick of
the spur, but now he had become older, and he murmured that
philosophical "<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Bah!</i>"
which served as a bridle to all the passions.</p>

W</span>hen D'Artagnan had perfectly convinced himself that the
absence of the Vicar-General d'Herblay was real, and that his
friend was not to be found at Melun or in its vicinity, he left
Bazin without regret, cast an ill-natured glance at the
magnificent Ch&acirc;teau de Vaux, which was beginning to shine
with that splendor which brought on its ruin, and, compressing
his lips like a man full of mistrust and suspicion, he put spurs
to his pied horse, saying, "Well, well!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have still Pierrefonds left, and
there I shall find the best man and the best filled coffer.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And that is all I want, for I
have an idea of my own."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> We will spare our
readers the prosaic incidents of D'Artagnan's journey, which
terminated on the morning of the third day within sight of
Pierrefonds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan
came by the way of Nanteuil-le-Haudouin and Cr&eacute;py.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At a distance he perceived the
Castle of Louis of Orl&eacute;ans, which, having become part of
the crown domain, was kept by an old <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>concierge</i>.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This was one of those marvelous
manors of the middle ages, with walls twenty feet in thickness,
and a hundred in height.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan rode slowly
past its walls, measured its towers with his eye and descended
into the valley.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> From
afar he looked down upon the ch&acirc;teau of Porthos, situated
on the shores of a small lake, and contiguous to a magnificent
forest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was the same
place we have already had the honor of describing to our readers;
we shall therefore satisfy ourselves with naming it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The first thing D'Artagnan perceived
after the fine trees, the May sun gilding the sides of the green
hills, the long rows of feather-topped trees which stretched out
towards Compi&egrave;gne, was a large rolling box, pushed forward
by two servants and dragged by two others.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In this box there was an enormous
green-and-gold thing, which went along the smiling glades of the
park, thus dragged and pushed.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This thing, at a distance, could not
be distinguished, and signified absolutely nothing; nearer, it
was a hogshead muffled in gold-bound green cloth; when close, it
was a man, or rather a <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>poussa</i>, the inferior extremity
of whom, spreading over the interior of the box, entirely filled
it; when still closer, the man was Mousqueton - Mousqueton, with
gray hair and a face as red as Punchinello's.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Pardieu!</i>" cried D'Artagnan;
"why, that's my dear Monsieur Mousqueton!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!" cried the fat man
- "ah! what happiness! what joy!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There's M. d'Artagnan. <span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Stop, you rascals!"<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> These last words were addressed to
the lackeys who pushed and dragged him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The box stopped, and the four
lackeys, with a precision quite military, took off their laced
hats and ranged themselves behind it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, Monsieur
d'Artagnan!" said Mousqueton, "why can I not embrace your
knees?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But I have become
impotent, as you see."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "<i style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

age; it is infirmities - troubles."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Troubles! you,
Mousqueton?" said D'Artagnan, making the tour of the box; "are
you out of your mind, my dear friend?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Thank God! you are as hearty as a
three-hundred-year-old oak."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! but my legs,
monsieur, my legs!" groaned the faithful servant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

your legs?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

bear me!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah, the ungrateful
things!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And yet you feed
them well, Mousqueton, apparently."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Alas, yes!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They can reproach me with nothing in
that respect," said Mousqueton, with a sigh; "I have always done
what I could for my poor body; I am not selfish."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And Mousqueton sighed afresh.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I wonder whether
Mousqueton wants to be a baron, too, as he sighs after that

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Mousqueton, as if rousing himself from a painful reverie; "how
happy monseigneur will be that you have thought of him!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

D'Artagnan, "I am anxious to embrace him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

much affected, "I shall certainly write to him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

D'Artagnan, "you will write to him?"</p>

"Fall back, you fellows," with such powerful lungs that the
breath, without the words, would have been sufficient to disperse
the four lackeys.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan seated himself on the shaft of the box and opened his
ears.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Monsieur," said
Mousqueton, "monseigneur, then, received a letter from M. le

Wednesday."</p>

so many pleasures to take in this delightful country, that we
were encumbered by them; so much so, that we have been forced to
regulate the distribution of them."</p>

religious: monseigneur goes to mass, makes the bread-offering,

is not very amusing, but we expect a Carmelite from Paris who
will do the duty of our almonry, and who, we are assured, speaks
very well, which will keep us awake, whereas our present almoner
always sends us to sleep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>

struck the wall a blow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>

monsieur?" said he, casting down his eyes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

wine - evenings occupied in passing the bottle."</p>

resumed D'Artagnan, "pardon me, but I was so absorbed in your
charming recital that I have forgotten the principal object of
our conversation, which was to learn what M. le

your master about."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is true,

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monseigneur read it and

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

was for some duel?" said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, monsieur, there
were only these words: 'Dear Porthos, set out, if you would wish

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "<i style=

thoughtfully, "that was pressing, apparently."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

continued Mousqueton, "monseigneur set out the very same day with
his secretary, in order to endeavor to arrive in time."</p>

"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The Equinox?<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And you think Porthos
will have arrived first, do you?" asked D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am sure of it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This Equinox, however rich he
may be, has certainly no horses so good as monseigneur's."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan repressed his
inclination to laugh, because the brevity of Aramis's letter gave
rise to reflection.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He
followed Mousqueton, or rather Mousqueton's chariot, to the
castle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He sat down to a
sumptuous table, of which they did him the honors as to a
king.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But he could draw
nothing from Mousqueton, - the faithful servant seemed to shed
tears at will, but that was all.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan, after a
night passed in an excellent bed, reflected much upon the meaning
of Aramis's letter; puzzled himself as to the relation of the
Equinox with the affairs of Porthos; and being unable to make
anything out unless it concerned some <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>amour</i> of the bishop's, for which
it was necessary that the days and nights should be equal,
D'Artagnan left Pierrefonds as he had left Melun, as he had left
the ch&acirc;teau of the Comte de la F&egrave;re.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was not, however, without a
melancholy, which might in good sooth pass for one of the most
dismal of D'Artagnan's moods.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His head cast down, his eyes fixed,
he suffered his legs to hang on each side of his horse, and said
to himself, in that vague sort of reverie which ascends sometimes
to the sublimest eloquence:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No more friends! no
more future! no more anything!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> My energies are broken like the
bonds of our ancient friendship.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh, old age is coming, cold and
inexorable; it envelopes in its funeral cr&ecirc;pe all that was
brilliant, all that was embalming in my youth; then it throws
that sweet burthen on its shoulders and carries it away with the
rest into the fathomless gulf of death."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> A shudder crept through
the heart of the Gascon, so brave and so strong against all the
misfortunes of life; and during some moments the clouds appeared
black to him, the earth slippery and full of pits as that of
cemeteries.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Whither am I going?"
said he to himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "What
am I going to do!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Alone,
quite alone - without family, without friends!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Bah!" cried he all at once.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he clapped spurs to his
horse, who, having found nothing melancholy in the heavy oats of
Pierrefonds, profited by this permission to show his gayety in a
gallop which absorbed two leagues.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "To Paris!" said D'Artagnan to
himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And on the

D'Artagnan, stooping to enter the shop.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Planchet, "to look after Monsieur d'Artagnan's horse, - somebody

this coffee, this treacle, and these raisins," said Planchet;

much the better!"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And
Planchet breathed freely again, whilst D'Artagnan seated himself
quietly down in the shop, upon a bale of corks, and made a survey
of the premises.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The shop
was well stocked; there was a mingled perfume of ginger,
cinnamon, and ground pepper, which made D'Artagnan sneeze.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The shop-boy, proud of being
in company with so renowned a warrior, of a lieutenant of
musketeers, who approached the person of the king, began to work
with an enthusiasm which was something like delirium, and to
serve the customers with a disdainful haste that was noticed by
several.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Planchet put away his
money, and made up his accounts, amidst civilities addressed to
his former master.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Planchet had with his equals the short speech and haughty
familiarity of the rich shopkeeper who serves everybody and waits
for nobody.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan
observed this habit with a pleasure which we shall analyze
presently.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He saw night
come on by degrees, and at length Planchet conducted him to a
chamber on the first story, where, amidst bales and chests, a
table very nicely set out awaited the two guests.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

advantage of a moment's pause to examine the countenance of
Planchet, whom he had not seen for a year.<span style=

slight protuberance in front, but his countenance was not
puffed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His keen eye
still played with facility in its deep-sunk orbit; and fat, which
levels all the characteristic saliences of the human face, had
not yet touched either his high cheek-bones, the sign of cunning
and cupidity, or his pointed chin, the sign of acuteness and
perseverance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Planchet
reigned with as much majesty in his dining-room as in his
shop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He set before his
master a frugal, but perfectly Parisian repast: roast meat,
cooked at the baker's, with vegetables, salad, and a dessert
borrowed from the shop itself.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan was pleased that the
grocer had drawn from behind the fagots a bottle of that Anjou

wine.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

A</span>fter a moment's silence, in which D'Artagnan appeared to
be collecting, not one idea, but all his ideas - "It cannot be,
my dear Planchet," said he, "that you have not heard of his
majesty Charles I. of England?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Alas! yes, monsieur,
since you left France in order to assist him, and that, in spite

his fall."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Exactly so; I see you

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

would be, if I could have lost that memory, however bad it might
have been.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When one has
heard Grimaud, who, you know, is not given to talking, relate how
the head of King Charles fell, how you sailed the half of a night
in a scuttled vessel, and saw floating on the water that good M.
Mordaunt with a certain gold-hafted dagger buried in his breast,
one is not very likely to forget such things."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And yet there are
people who forget them, Planchet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

you of one thing, and that is that Charles I. had a son."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Without contradicting
you, monsieur, he had two," said Planchet; "for I saw the second
one in Paris, M. le Duke of York, one day, as he was going to the
Palais Royal, and I was told that he was not the eldest son of
Charles I.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As to the
eldest, I have the honor of knowing him by name, but not
personally."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

point, Planchet, we must come to: it is to this eldest son,

Charles II., king of England."</p>

may add an unfortunate prince, more unfortunate than the poorest
man of the people lost in the worst quarter of Paris."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

full of that sort of compassion which we grant to strangers with
whom we think we can never possibly find ourselves in
contact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Besides, he did
not see in this politico-sentimental operation any sign of the
commercial idea of M. d'Artagnan, and it was in this idea that
D'Artagnan, who was, from habit, pretty well acquainted with men
and things, had principally interested Planchet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Prince of Wales, a king without a kingdom, as you have so well
said, Planchet, has interested me.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I, D'Artagnan, have seen him begging
assistance of Mazarin, who is a miser, and the aid of Louis, who
is a child, and it appeared to me, who am acquainted with such
things, that in the intelligent eye of the fallen king, in the
nobility of his whole person, a nobility apparent above all his
miseries, I could discern the stuff of a man and the heart of a
king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Planchet tacitly
approved of all this; but it did not at all, in his eyes at

is the reasoning which I made with myself.<span style=

king without a kingdom is, in my opinion, a grain of seed which
will blossom in some season or other, provided a skillful,
discreet, and vigorous hand sow it duly and truly, selecting
soil, sky, and time."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Planchet still approved
by a nod of his head, which showed that he did not perfectly

Planchet, looking earnestly at his old master, as if in doubt as
to the state of his reason.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

and fifty thousand livres," said Planchet, innocently, perceiving
that D'Artagnan hesitated.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, the devil, no!"
said D'Artagnan, "the division cannot be made by half; that would
not be just."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And yet, monsieur, we
each lay down half," objected Planchet, timidly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes; but listen to this
clause, my dear Planchet, and if you do not find if equitable in
every respect when it is written, well, we can scratch it out
again: - 'Nevertheless, as M. d'Artagnan brings to the
association, besides his capital of twenty thousand livres, his
time, his idea, his industry, and his skin, - things which he
appreciates strongly, particularly the last, - M. d'Artagnan will
keep, of the three hundred thousand livres, two hundred thousand
livres for himself, which will make his share two-thirds."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very well," said
Planchet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Perfectly just,
monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And you will be
contented with a hundred thousand livres?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "How, in a month?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, I only ask one
month."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur," said
Planchet, generously, "I give you six weeks."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Thank you," replied the
musketeer, politely; after which the two partners reperused their
deed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is perfect,
monsieur," said Planchet; "and the late M. Coquenard, the first
husband of Madame la Baronne du Vallon, could not have done it
better."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do you find it so?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Let us sign it then."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And both affixed their
signatures.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

D'Artagnan, "I shall be under obligations to no one."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But I shall be under
obligations to you," said Planchet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No; for whatever store
I set by it, Planchet, I may lose my skin yonder, and you will
lose all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>A propos - peste! -</i> that makes
me think of the principal, an indispensable clause.<span style=

d'Artagnan dying in this enterprise, liquidation will be
considered made, and the Sieur Planchet will give quittance from
that moment to the shade of Messire d'Artagnan for the twenty
thousand livres paid by him into the hands of the said
company.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This last clause made
Planchet knit his brows a little, but when he saw the brilliant
eye, the muscular hand, the supple and strong back of his
associate, he regained his courage, and, without regret, he at
once added another stroke to his signature.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan did the same.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Thus was drawn the first known
company contract; perhaps such things have been abused a little
since, both in form and principle.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Now," said Planchet,
pouring out the last glass of Anjou wine for D'Artagnan, - "now
go to sleep, my dear master."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No," replied
D'Artagnan; "for the most difficult part now remains to be done,
and I will think over that difficult part."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

have such great confidence in you, M. d'Artagnan, that I would
not give my hundred thousand livres for ninety thousand livres
down."</p>

'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And devil take me if I
don't think you are right!"<span style=

D</span>'Artagnan reflected to such good purpose during the night
that his plan was settled by morning.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "This is it," said he, sitting up in
bed, supporting his elbow on his knee, and his chin in his hand;
- "this is it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I shall
seek out forty steady, firm men, recruited among people a little
compromised, but having habits of discipline.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I shall promise them five hundred
livres for a month if they return; nothing if they do not return,
or half for their kindred.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As to food and lodging, that
concerns the English, who have cattle in their pastures, bacon in
their bacon-racks, fowls in their poultry-yards, and corn in
their barns.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I will
present myself to General Monk with my little body of
troops.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He will receive
me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I shall win his
confidence, and take advantage of it, as soon as possible."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> But without going
further, D'Artagnan shook his head and interrupted himself.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "No," said he; "I should not
dare to relate this to Athos; the way is therefore not
honorable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I must use
violence," continued he, - "very certainly I must, but without
compromising my loyalty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
With forty men I will traverse the country as a partisan.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But if I fall in with, not
forty thousand English, as Planchet said, but purely and simply
with four hundred, I shall be beaten.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Supposing that among my forty
warriors there should be found at least ten stupid ones - ten who
will allow themselves to be killed one after the other, from mere
folly?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No; it is, in
fact, impossible to find forty men to be depended upon - they do
not exist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I must learn
how to be contented with thirty.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> With ten men less I should have the
right of avoiding any armed encounter, on account of the small
number of my people; and if the encounter should take place, my
chance is better with thirty men than forty.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Besides, I should save five thousand
francs; that is to say, the eighth of my capital; that is worth
the trial.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This being so,
I should have thirty men.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
I shall divide them into three bands, - we will spread ourselves
about over the country, with an injunction to reunite at a given
moment; in this fashion, ten by ten, we should excite no
suspicion - we should pass unperceived.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Yes, yes, thirty - that is a magic
number.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There are three
tens - three, that divine number!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And then, truly, a company of thirty
men, when all together, will look rather imposing.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Ah! stupid wretch that I am!"
continued D'Artagnan, "I want thirty horses.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That is ruinous.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Where the devil was my head when I
forgot the horses?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We
cannot, however, think of striking such a blow without
horses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well, so be it,
that sacrifice must be made; we can get the horses in the country
- they are not bad, besides.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But I forgot - <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>peste!</i><span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Three bands - that necessitates
three leaders; there is the difficulty.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Of the three commanders I have
already one - that is myself; - yes, but the two others will of
themselves cost almost as much money as all the rest of the
troop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No; positively I
must have but one lieutenant.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In that case, then, I should reduce
my troop to twenty men.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I
know very well that twenty men is but very little; but since with
thirty I was determined not to seek to come to blows, I should do
so more carefully still with twenty.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Twenty - that is a round number;
that, besides, reduces the number of the horses by ten, which is
a consideration; and then, with a good lieutenant - <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mordioux!</i> what things patience
and calculation are!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Was
I not going to embark with forty men, and I have now reduced them
to twenty for an equal success?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Ten thousand livres saved at one
stroke, and more safety; that is well!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now, then, let us see; we have
nothing to do but to find this lieutenant - let him be found,
then; and after -<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That is
not so easy; he must be brave and good, a second myself.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Yes, but a lieutenant must
have my secret, and as that secret is worth a million, and I
shall only pay my man a thousand livres, fifteen hundred at the
most, my man will sell the secret to Monk.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mordioux!</i> no lieutenant.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Besides, this man, were he as
mute as a disciple of Pythagoras, - this man would be sure to
have in the troop some favorite soldier, whom he would make his
sergeant; the sergeant would penetrate the secret of the
lieutenant, in case the latter should be honest and unwilling to
sell it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then the
sergeant, less honest and less ambitious, will give up the whole
for fifty thousand livres.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Come, come! that is impossible.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The lieutenant is
impossible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But then I
must have no fractions; I cannot divide my troop in two, and act
upon two points, at once, without another self, who -<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But what is the use of acting upon
two points, as we have only one man to take?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What can be the use of weakening a
corps by placing the right here, and the left there?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A single corps - <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mordioux!</i> a single one, and that
commanded by D'Artagnan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Very well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But twenty men
marching in one band are suspected by everybody; twenty horsemen
must not be seen marching together, or a company will be detached
against them and the password will be required; the which
company, upon seeing them embarrassed to give it, would shoot M.
d'Artagnan and his men like so many rabbits.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I reduce myself then to ten men; in
this fashion I shall act simply and with unity; I shall be forced
to be prudent, which is half the success in an affair of the kind
I am undertaking; a greater number might, perhaps, have drawn me
into some folly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Ten
horses are not many, either, to buy or take.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A capital idea; what tranquillity it
infuses into my mind! no more suspicions - no passwords - no more
dangers!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Ten men, they
are valets or clerks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Ten
men, leading ten horses laden with merchandise of whatever kind,
are tolerated, well received everywhere.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Ten men travel on account of the
house of Planchet &amp; Co., of France, - nothing can be said
against that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> These ten
men, clothed like manufacturers, have a good cutlass or a good
musket at their saddle-bow, and a good pistol in the
holster.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They never allow
themselves to be uneasy, because they have no evil designs.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They are, perhaps, in truth, a
little disposed to be smugglers, but what harm is in that?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Smuggling is not, like
polygamy, a hanging offense.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The worst that can happen to us is
the confiscation of our merchandise.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Our merchandise confiscated - a fine
affair that!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Come, come!
it is a superb plan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Ten
men only - ten men, whom I will engage for my service; ten men
who shall be as resolute as forty, who would cost me four times
as much, and to whom, for greater security, I will never open my
mouth as to my designs, and to whom I shall only say 'My friends,
there is a blow to be struck.'<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Things being after this fashion,
Satan will be very malicious if he plays me one of his
tricks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fifteen thousand
livres saved - that's superb - out of twenty!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Thus fortified by his
laborious calculations, D'Artagnan stopped at this plan, and
determined to change nothing in it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had already on a list furnished
by his inexhaustible memory, ten men illustrious amongst the
seekers of adventure, ill-treated by fortune, and not on good
terms with justice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Upon
this D'Artagnan rose, and instantly set off on the search,
telling Planchet not to expect him to breakfast, and perhaps not
to dinner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A day and a
half spent in rummaging amongst certain dens of Paris sufficed
for his recruiting; and, without allowing his adventurers to
communicate with each other, he had picked up and got together,
in less than thirty hours, a charming collection of ill-looking
faces, speaking a French less pure than the English they were
about to attempt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> These
men were, for the most part, guards, whose merit D'Artagnan had
had an opportunity of appreciating in various encounters, whom
drunkenness, unlucky sword-thrusts, unexpected winnings at play,
or the economical reforms of Mazarin, had forced to seek shade
and solitude, those two great consolers of irritated and chafing
spirits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They bore upon
their countenances and in their vestments the traces of the
heartaches they had undergone.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Some had their visages scarred, -
all had their clothes in rags.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan comforted the most needy
of these brotherly miseries by a prudent distribution of the
crowns of the company; then, having taken care that these crowns
should be employed in the physical improvement of the troop, he
appointed a trysting place in the north of France, between
Bergues and Saint Omer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Six days were allowed as the utmost term, and D'Artagnan was
sufficiently acquainted with the good-will, the good-humor, and
the relative probity of these illustrious recruits, to be certain
that not one of them would fail in his appointment.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> These orders given, this rendezvous
fixed, he went to bid farewell to Planchet, who asked news of his
army.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan did not
think it proper to inform him of the reduction he had made in his
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>personnel</i>.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He feared that the confidence of his
associate would be abated by such an avowal.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Planchet was delighted to learn that
the army was levied, and that he (Planchet) found himself a kind
of half king, who from his throne-counter kept in pay a body of
troops destined to make war against perfidious Albion, that enemy
of all true French hearts.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Planchet paid down in double louis,
twenty thousand livres to D'Artagnan, on the part of himself
(Planchet), and twenty thousand livres, still in double louis, in
account with D'Artagnan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan placed each of the twenty thousand francs in a bag,
and weighing a bag in each hand, - "This money is very
embarrassing, my dear Planchet," said he.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Do you know this weighs thirty
pounds?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Bah! your horse will
carry that like a feather."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan shook his
head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Don't tell me such
things, Planchet: a horse overloaded with thirty pounds, in
addition to the rider and his portmanteau, cannot cross a river
so easily - cannot leap over a wall or ditch so lightly; and the
horse failing, the horseman fails.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is true that you, Planchet, who
have served in the infantry, may not be aware of all that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Then what is to be
done, monsieur?" said Planchet, greatly embarrassed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Listen to me," said
D'Artagnan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I will pay
my army on its return home.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Keep my half of twenty thousand
livres, which you can use during that time."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And my half?" said
Planchet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I shall take that with
me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your confidence does me
honor," said Planchet: "but supposing you should not return?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is possible,
though not very probable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Then, Planchet, in case I should not return - give me a pen; I
will make my will."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan took a pen and some paper, and wrote upon a plain
sheet, - "I, D'Artagnan, possess twenty thousand livres, laid up
cent per cent during thirty years that I have been in the service
of his majesty the king of France.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I leave five thousand to Athos, five
thousand to Porthos, and five thousand to Aramis, that they may
give the said sums in my name and their own to my young friend
Raoul, Vicomte de Bragelonne.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I give the remaining five thousand
to Planchet, that he may distribute the fifteen thousand with
less regret among my friends.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> With which purpose I sign these
presents. - D'ARTAGNAN."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Planchet appeared very
curious to know what D'Artagnan had written.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Here," said the
musketeer, "read it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> On reading the last
lines the tears came into Planchet's eyes.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "You think, then, that I would not
have given the money without that?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then I will have none of your five
thousand francs."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan smiled.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Accept it, accept it,
Planchet; and in that way you will only lose fifteen thousand
francs instead of twenty thousand, and you will not be tempted to
disregard the signature of your master and friend, by losing
nothing at all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> How well that dear
Monsieur d'Artagnan knew the hearts of men and grocers!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They who have pronounced Don
Quixote mad because he rode out to the conquest of an empire with
nobody but Sancho his squire, and they who have pronounced Sancho
mad because he accompanied his master in his attempt to conquer
the said empire, - they certainly will have no hesitation in
extending the same judgment to D'Artagnan and Planchet.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And yet the first passed for
one of the most subtle spirits among the astute spirits of the
court of France.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As to
the second, he had acquired by good right the reputation of
having one of the longest heads among the grocers of the Rue des
Lombards; consequently of Paris, and consequently of France.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now, to consider these two men
from the point of view from which you would consider other men,
and the means by the aid of which they contemplated to restore a
monarch to his throne, compared with other means, the shallowest
brains of the country where brains are most shallow must have
revolted against the presumptuous madness of the lieutenant and
the stupidity of his associate.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fortunately, D'Artagnan was not a
man to listen to the idle talk of those around him, or to the
comments that were made on himself.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had adopted the motto, "Act well,
and let people talk."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Planchet, on his part had adopted this, "Act and say
nothing."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It resulted
from this, that, according to the custom of all superior
geniuses, these two men flattered themselves, <i style=

right against all who found fault with them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> As a beginning,
D'Artagnan set out in the finest of possible weather, without a
cloud in the heavens - without a cloud on his mind, joyous and
strong, calm and decided, great in his resolution, and
consequently carrying with him a tenfold dose of that potent
fluid which the shocks of mind cause to spring from the nerves,
and which procure for the human machine a force and an influence
of which future ages will render, according to all probability, a
more arithmetical account than we can possibly do at
present.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was again, as
in times past, on that same road of adventures which had led him
to Boulogne, and which he was now traveling for the fourth
time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It appeared to him
that he could almost recognize the trace of his own steps upon
the road, and that of his fist upon the doors of the hostelries;
- his memory, always active and present, brought back that youth
which neither thirty years later his great heart nor his wrist of
steel would have belied.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
What a rich nature was that of this man!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had all the passions, all the
defects, all the weaknesses, and the spirit of contradiction
familiar to his understanding changed all these imperfections
into corresponding qualities.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan, thanks to his ever
active imagination, was afraid of a shadow, and ashamed of being
afraid, he marched straight up to that shadow, and then became
extravagant in his bravery, if the danger proved to be real.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Thus everything in him was
emotion, and therefore enjoyment.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He loved the society of others, but
never became tired of his own; and more than once, if he could
have been heard when he was alone, he might have been seen
laughing at the jokes he related to himself or the tricks his
imagination created just five minutes before <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ennui</i> might have been looked
for.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan was not
perhaps so gay this time as he would have been with the prospect
of finding some good friends at Calais, instead of joining the
ten scamps there; melancholy, however, did not visit him more
than once a day, and it was about five visits that he received
from that somber deity before he got sight of the sea at
Boulogne, and then these visits were indeed but short.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But when once D'Artagnan found
himself near the field of action, all other feelings but that of
confidence disappeared never to return.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> From Boulogne he followed the coast
to Calais.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Calais was the
place of general rendezvous, and at Calais he had named to each
of his recruits the hostelry of "Le Grande Monarque," where
living was not extravagant, where sailors messed, and where men
of the sword, with sheath of leather, be it understood, found
lodging, table, food, and all the comforts of life, for thirty
sous per diem.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan
proposed to himself to take them by surprise <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in flagrante delicto</i> of
wandering life, and to judge by the first appearance if he could
count on them as trusty companions.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

half past four in the afternoon.</p>

T</span>he hostelry of "Le Grand Monarque" was situated in a
little street parallel to the port without looking out upon the
port itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Some lanes
cut - as steps cut the two parallels of the ladder - the two
great straight lines of the port and the street.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> By these lanes passengers came
suddenly from the port into the street, or from the street on to
the port.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan,
arrived at the port, took one of these lanes, and came out in
front of the hostelry of "Le Grand Monarque."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The moment was well chosen and might
remind D'Artagnan of his start in life at the hostelry of the
"Franc-Meunier" at Meung.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Some sailors who had been playing at dice had started a quarrel,
and were threatening each other furiously.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The host, hostess, and two lads were
watching with anxiety the circle of these angry gamblers, from
the midst of which war seemed ready to break forth, bristling
with knives and hatchets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The play, nevertheless, was continued.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A stone bench was occupied by two
men, who appeared thence to watch the door; four tables, placed
at the back of the common chamber, were occupied by eight other
individuals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Neither the
men at the door, nor those at the tables took any part in the
play or the quarrel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan recognized his ten men in these cold, indifferent
spectators.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The quarrel
went on increasing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Every
passion has, like the sea, its tide which ascends and
descends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Reaching the
climax of passion, one sailor overturned the table and the money
which was upon it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
table fell, and the money rolled about.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In an instant all belonging to the
hostelry threw themselves upon the stakes, and many a piece of
silver was picked up by people who stole away whilst the sailors
were scuffling with each other.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The two men on the bench
and the eight at the tables, although they seemed perfect
strangers to each other, these ten men alone, we say, appeared to
have agreed to remain impassible amidst the cries of fury and the
chinking of money.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Two
only contented themselves with pushing with their feet combatants
who came under their table.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Two others, rather than take part in
this disturbance, buried their hands in their pockets; and
another two jumped upon the table they occupied, as people do to
avoid being submerged by overflowing water.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Come, come," said
D'Artagnan to himself, not having lost one of the details we have
related, "this is a very fair gathering - circumspect, calm,
accustomed to disturbance, acquainted with blows!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Peste!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></i> I have been lucky."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> All at once his
attention was called to a particular part of the room.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The two men who had pushed the
strugglers with their feet, were assailed with abuse by the
sailors, who had become reconciled.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> One of them, half drunk with
passion, and quite drunk with beer, came, in a menacing manner,
to demand of the shorter of these two sages by what right he had
touched with his foot creatures of the good God, who were not
dogs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And whilst putting
this question, in order to make it more direct, he applied his
great fist to the nose of D'Artagnan's recruit.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This man became pale,
without its being to be discerned whether his pallor arose from
anger or fear; seeing which, the sailor concluded it was from
fear, and raised his fist with the manifest intention of letting
it fall upon the head of the stranger.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But though the threatened man did
not appear to move, he dealt the sailor such a severe blow in the
stomach that he sent him rolling and howling to the other side of
the room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the same
instant, rallied by the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>espirit de corps</i>, all the
comrades of the conquered man fell upon the conqueror</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The latter, with the
same coolness of which he had given proof, without committing the
imprudence of touching his weapons, took up a beer-pot with a
pewter-lid, and knocked down two or three of his assailants;
then, as he was about to yield to numbers, the seven other silent
men at the tables, who had not yet stirred, perceived that their
cause was at stake, and came to the rescue.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the same time, the two
indifferent spectators at the door turned round with frowning
bows, indicating their evident intention of taking the enemy in
the rear, if the enemy did not cease their aggressions.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The host, his helpers,
and two watchmen who were passing, and who from the curiosity had
penetrated too far into the room, were mixed up in the tumult and
showered with blows.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
Parisians hit like Cyclops, with an <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ensemble</i> and a tactic delightful
to behold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At length,
obliged to beat a retreat before superior numbers, they formed an
intrenchment behind the large table, which they raised by main
force; whilst the two others, arming themselves each with a
trestle, and using it like a great sledge-hammer, knocked down at
a blow eight sailors upon whose heads they had brought their
monstrous catapult in play.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The floor was already strewn with
wounded, and the room filled with cries and dust, when
D'Artagnan, satisfied with the test, advanced, sword in hand, and
striking with the pommel every head that came in his way, he
uttered a vigorous <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>hol&agrave;!</i> which put an
instantaneous end to the conflict.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A great back-flood directly took
place from the center to the sides of the room, so that
D'Artagnan found himself isolated and dominator.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What is this all
about?" then demanded he of the assembly, with the majestic tone
of Neptune pronouncing the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Quos ego</i>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> At the very instant, at
the first sound of his voice, to carry on the Virgilian metaphor,
D'Artagnan's recruits, recognizing each his sovereign lord,
discontinued their plank-fighting and trestle blows.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On their side, the sailors, seeing
that long naked sword, that martial air, and the agile arm which
came to the rescue of their enemies, in the person of a man who
seemed accustomed to command, the sailors picked up their wounded
and their pitchers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
Parisians wiped their brows, and viewed their leader with
respect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan was
loaded with thanks by the host of "Le Grand Monarque."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He received them like a man
who knows that nothing is being offered that does not belong to
him, and then said he would go and walk upon the port till supper
was ready.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Immediately
each of the recruits, who understood the summons, took his hat,
brushed the dust off his clothes, and followed D'Artagnan.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But D'Artagnan, whilst walking
and observing, took care not to stop; he directed his course
towards the downs, and the ten men - surprised at finding
themselves going in the track of each other, uneasy at seeing on
their right, on their left, and behind them, companions upon whom
they had not reckoned - followed him, casting furtive glances at
each other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was not
till he had arrived at the hollow part of the deepest down that
D'Artagnan, smiling to see them outdone, turned towards them,
making a friendly sign with his hand.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Eh! come, come,
gentlemen," said he, "let us not devour each other; you are made
to live together, to understand each other in all respects, and
not to devour one another."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Instantly all hesitation
ceased; the men breathed as if they had been taken out of a
coffin, and examined each other complacently.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> After this examination they turned
their eyes towards their leader, who had long been acquainted
with the art of speaking to men of that class, and who improvised
the following little speech, pronounced with an energy truly
Gascon:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Gentlemen, you all know
who I am.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have engaged
you from knowing you to be brave, and willing to associate you
with me in a glorious enterprise.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Imagine that in laboring for me you
labor for the king.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I
only warn you that if you allow anything of this supposition to
appear, I shall be forced to crack your skulls immediately, in
the manner most convenient to me.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You are not ignorant, gentlemen,
that state secrets are like a mortal poison: as long as that
poison is in its box and the box is closed, it is not injurious;
out of the box, it kills.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Now draw near, and you shall know as much of this secret as I am
able to tell you."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> All
drew close to him with an expression of curiosity.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Approach," continued D'Artagnan,
"and let not the bird which passes over our heads, the rabbit
which sports on the downs, the fish which bounds from the waters,
hear us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Our business is
to learn and to report to monsieur le surintendant of the
finances to what extent English smuggling is injurious to the
French merchants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I shall
enter every place, and see everything.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We are poor Picard fishermen, thrown
upon the coast by a storm.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is certain that we must sell
fish, neither more nor less, like true fishermen.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Only people might guess who we are,
and might molest us; it is therefore necessary that we should be
in a condition to defend ourselves.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And this is why I have selected men
of spirit and courage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We
shall lead a steady life, and not incur much danger, seeing that
we have behind us a powerful protector, thanks to whom no
embarrassment is possible.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> One thing alone puzzles me; but I
hope that after a short explanation, you will relieve me from
that difficulty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
thing which puzzles me is taking with me a crew of stupid
fishermen, which crew will annoy me immensely, whilst if, by
chance, there were among you any who have seen the sea - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! don't let that
trouble you," said one of the recruits; "I was a prisoner among
the pirates of Tunis three years, and can maneuver a boat like an
admiral."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "See," said D'Artagnan,
"what an admirable thing chance is!"<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan pronounced these words
with an indefinable tone of feigned <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bonhomie</i>, for he knew very well
that the victim of the pirates was an old corsair, and had
engaged him in consequence of that knowledge.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But D'Artagnan never said more than
there was need to say, in order to leave people in doubt.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He paid himself with the
explanation, and welcomed the effect, without appearing to be
preoccupied with the cause.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And I," said a second,
"I, by chance, had an uncle who directed the works of the port of
La Rochelle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When quite a
child, I played about the boats, and I know how to handle an oar
or a sail as well as the best Ponantais sailor."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The latter did not lie much more
than the first, for he had rowed on board his majesty's galleys
six years, at Ciotat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Two
others were more frank: they confessed honestly that they had
served on board a vessel as soldiers as punishment, and did not
blush for it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan
found himself, then, the leader of ten men of war and four
sailors, having at once an land army and a sea force, which would
have carried the pride of Planchet to its height, if Planchet had
known the details.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Nothing was now left but
arranging the general orders, and D'Artagnan gave them with
precision.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He enjoined
his men to be ready to set out for the Hague, some following the
coast which leads to Breskens, others the road to Antwerp.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The rendezvous was given, by
calculating each day's march, a fortnight from that time, upon
the chief place at the Hague.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan recommended his men to go
in couples, as they liked best, from sympathy.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He himself selected from among those
with the least disreputable look, two guards whom he had formerly
known, and whose only faults were being drunkards and
gamblers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> These men had
not entirely lost all ideas of civilization, and under proper
garments their hearts would beat again.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan, not to create any
jealousy with the others, made the rest go forward.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He kept his two selected ones,
clothed them from his own wardrobe, and set out with them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> It was to these two,
whom he seemed to honor with an absolute confidence, that
D'Artagnan imparted a false secret, destined to secure the
success of the expedition.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He confessed to them that the object
was not to learn to what extent French merchants were injured by
English smuggling, but to learn how far French smuggling could
annoy English trade.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
These men appeared convinced; they were effectively so.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan was quite sure that
at the first debauch, when thoroughly drunk, one of the two would
divulge the secret to the whole band.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His game appeared infallible.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> A fortnight after all we
have said had taken place at Calais, the whole troop assembled at
the Hague.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Then D'Artagnan
perceived that all his men, with remarkable intelligence, had
already travestied themselves into sailors, more or less
ill-treated by the sea.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan left them to sleep in a den in Newkerke street, whilst
he lodged comfortably upon the Grand Canal.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He learned that the king of England
had come back to his old ally, William II. of Nassau, stadtholder
of Holland.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He learned
also that the refusal of Louis XIV. had a little cooled the
protection afforded him up to that time, and in consequence he
had gone to reside in a little village house at Scheveningen,
situated in the downs, on the sea-shore, about a league from the
Hague.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> There, it was said, the
unfortunate banished king consoled himself in his exile, by
looking, with the melancholy peculiar to the princes of his race,
at that immense North Sea, which separated him from his England,
as it had formerly separated Mary Stuart from France.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There, behind the trees of the
beautiful wood of Scheveningen, on the fine sand upon which grows
the golden broom of the down, Charles II. vegetated as it did,
more unfortunate, for he had life and thought, and he hoped and
despaired by turns.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan went once as
far as Scheveningen, in order to be certain that all was true
that was said of the king.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He beheld Charles II., pensive and
alone, coming out of a little door opening into the wood, and
walking on the beach in the setting sun, without even attracting
the attention of the fishermen, who, on their return in the
evening, drew, like the ancient mariners of the Archipelago,
their barks up upon the sand of the shore.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan recognized
the king; he saw him fix his melancholy look upon the immense
extent of the waters, and absorb upon his pale countenance the
red rays of the sun already cut by the black line of the
horizon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then Charles
returned to his isolated abode, always alone, slow and sad,
amusing himself with making the friable and moving sand creak
beneath his feet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> That very evening
D'Artagnan hired for a thousand livres a fishing-boat worth four
thousand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He paid a
thousand livres down, and deposited the three thousand with a
Burgomaster, after which he brought on board, without their being
seen, the six men who formed his land army; and with the rising
tide, at three o'clock in the morning, he got into the open sea,
maneuvering ostensibly with the four others, and depending upon
the science of his galley slave as upon that of the first pilot
of the port.</p>

W</span>hile kings and men were thus occupied with England, which
governed itself quite alone, and which, it must be said in its
praise, had never been so badly governed, a man upon whom God had
fixed his eye, and placed his finger, a man predestined to write
his name in brilliant letters upon the page of history, was
pursuing in the face of the world a work full of mystery and
audacity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He went on, and
no one knew whither he meant to go, although not only England,
but France, and Europe, watched him marching with a firm step and
head held high.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> All that
was known of this man we are about to tell.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk had just declared
himself in favor of the liberty of the Rump Parliament, a
parliament which General Lambert, imitating Cromwell, whose
lieutenant he had been, had just blocked up so closely, in order
to bring it to his will, that no member, during all the blockade,
was able to go out, and only one, Peter Wentworth, had been able
to get in.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Lambert and Monk -
everything was summed up in these two men; the first representing
military despotism, the second pure republicanism.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> These men were the two sole
political representatives of that revolution in which Charles I.
had first lost his crown, and afterwards his head.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As regarded Lambert, he did not
dissemble his views; he sought to establish a military
government, and to be himself the head of that government.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk, a rigid
republican, some said, wished to maintain the Rump Parliament,
that visible though degenerated representative of the
republic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk, artful
and ambitious, said others, wished simply to make of this
parliament, which he affected to protect, a solid step by which
to mount the throne which Cromwell had left empty, but upon which
he had never dared to take his seat.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Thus Lambert by
persecuting the parliament, and Monk by declaring for it, had
mutually proclaimed themselves enemies of each other.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk and Lambert, therefore, had at
first thought of creating an army each for himself: Monk in
Scotland, where were the Presbyterians and the royalists, that is
to say, the malcontents; Lambert in London, where was found, as
is always the case, the strongest opposition to the existing
power which it had beneath its eyes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk had pacified
Scotland, he had there formed for himself an army, and found an
asylum.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The one watched
the other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk knew that
the day was not yet come, the day marked by the Lord for a great
change; his sword, therefore, appeared glued to the sheath.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Inexpugnable in his wild and
mountainous Scotland, an absolute general, king of an army of
eleven thousand old soldiers, whom he had more than once led on
to victory; as well informed, nay, even better, of the affairs of
London, than Lambert, who held garrison in the city, - such was
the position of Monk, when, at a hundred leagues from London, he
declared himself for the parliament.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Lambert, on the contrary, as we have
said, lived in the capital.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That was the center of all his
operations, and he there collected all around him all his
friends, and all the people of the lower class, eternally
inclined to cherish the enemies of constituted power.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> It was then in London
that Lambert learnt the support that, from the frontiers of
Scotland, Monk lent to the parliament.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He judged there was no time to be
lost, and that the Tweed was not so far distant from the Thames
that an army could not march from one river to the other,
particularly when it was well commanded.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He knew, besides, that as fast as
the soldiers of Monk penetrated into England, they would form on
their route that ball of snow, the emblem of the globe of
fortune, which is for the ambitious nothing but a step growing
unceasingly higher to conduct him to his object.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He got together, therefore, his
army, formidable at the same time for its composition and its
numbers, and hastened to meet Monk, who, on his part, like a
prudent navigator sailing amidst rocks, advanced by very short
marches, listening to the reports which came from London.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The two armies came in
sight of each other near Newcastle; Lambert, arriving first,
encamped in the city itself.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk, always circumspect, stopped
where he was, and placed his general quarters at Coldstream, on
the Tweed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The sight of
Lambert spread joy through Monk's army, whilst, on the contrary,
the sight of Monk threw disorder into Lambert's army.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It might have been thought that
these intrepid warriors, who had made such a noise in the streets
of London, had set out with the hopes of meeting no one, and that
now seeing that they had met an army, and that that army hoisted
before them not only a standard, but still further, a cause and a
principle, - it might have been believed, we say, that these
intrepid warriors had begun to reflect that they were less good
republicans than the soldiers of Monk, since the latter supported
the parliament; whilst Lambert supported nothing, not even
himself.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> As to Monk, if he had
had to reflect, or if he did reflect, it must have been after a
sad fashion, for history relates - and that modest dame, it is
well known, never lies - history relates, that the day of his
arrival at Coldstream search was made in vain throughout the
place for a single sheep.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> If Monk had commanded an
English army, that was enough to have brought about a general
desertion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But it is not
with the Scots as it is with the English, to whom that fluid
flesh which is called blood is a paramount necessity; the Scots,
a poor and sober race, live upon a little barley crushed between
two stones, diluted with the water of the fountain, and cooked
upon another stone, heated.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The Scots, their
distribution of barley being made, cared very little whether
there was or was not any meat in Coldstream.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk, little accustomed to
barley-cakes, was hungry, and his staff, at least as hungry as
himself, looked with anxiety right and left, to know what was
being prepared for supper.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk ordered search to
be made; his scouts had on arriving in the place found it
deserted and the cupboards empty; upon butchers and bakers it was
of no use depending in Coldstream.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The smallest morsel of bread, then,
could not be found for the general's table.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> As accounts succeeded
each other, all equally unsatisfactory, Monk, seeing terror and
discouragement upon every face, declared that he was not hungry;
besides, they should eat on the morrow, since Lambert was there
probably with the intention of giving battle, and consequently
would give up his provisions, if he were forced from Newcastle,
or forever to relieve Monk's soldiers from hunger if he
conquered.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This consolation was
only efficacious upon a very small number; but of what importance
was it to Monk? for Monk was very absolute, under the appearance
of the most perfect mildness.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Every one, therefore, was obliged to
be satisfied, or at least to appear so.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk, quite as hungry as his people,
but affecting perfect indifference for the absent mutton, cut a
fragment of tobacco, half an inch long, from the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>carotte</i> of a sergeant who formed
part of his suite, and began to masticate the said fragment,
assuring his lieutenant that hunger was a chimera, and that,
besides, people were never hungry when they had anything to
chew.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This joke satisfied some
of those who had resisted Monk's first deduction drawn from the
neighborhood of Lambert's army; the number of the dissentients
diminished greatly; the guard took their posts, the patrols
began, and the general continued his frugal repast beneath his
open tent.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Between his camp and
that of the enemy stood an old abbey, of which, at the present
day, there only remain some ruins, but which then was in
existence, and was called Newcastle Abbey.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was built upon a vast site,
independent at once of the plain and of the river, because it was
almost a marsh fed by springs and kept up by rains.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Nevertheless, in the midst of these
pools of water, covered with long grass, rushes, and reeds, were
seen solid spots of ground, formerly used as the kitchen-garden,
the park, the pleasure-gardens, and other dependencies of the
abbey, looking like one of those great sea-spiders, whose body is
round, whilst the claws go diverging round from this
circumference.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The kitchen-garden, one
of the longest claws of the abbey, extended to Monk's camp.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Unfortunately it was, as we
have said, early in June, and the kitchen-garden, being
abandoned, offered no resources.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk had ordered this
spot to be guarded, as most subject to surprises.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The fires of the enemy's general
were plainly to be perceived on the other side of the abbey.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But between these fires and
the abbey extended the Tweed, unfolding its luminous scales
beneath the thick shade of tall green oaks.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk was perfectly well acquainted
with this position, Newcastle and its environs having already
more than once been his headquarters.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He knew that by this day his enemy
might without doubt throw a few scouts into these ruins and
promote a skirmish, but that by night he would take care to
abstain from such a risk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
He felt himself, therefore, in security.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Thus his soldiers saw
him, after what he boastingly called his supper - that is to say,
after the exercise of mastication reported by us at the
commencement of this chapter - like Napoleon on the eve of
Austerlitz, seated asleep in his rush chair, half beneath the
light of his lamp, half beneath the reflection of the moon,
commencing its ascent in the heavens, which denoted that it was
nearly half past nine in the evening.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> All at once Monk was roused from his
half sleep, fictitious perhaps, by a troop of soldiers, who came
with joyous cries, and kicked the poles of his tent with a
humming noise as if on purpose to wake him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There was no need of so much noise;
the general opened his eyes quickly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, my children, what
is going on now?" asked the general.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "General!" replied
several voices at once, "General! you shall have some
supper."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I have had my supper,
gentlemen," replied he quietly, "and was comfortably digesting
it, as you see.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But come
in, and tell me what brings you hither."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Good news,
general."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Bah!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Has Lambert sent us word that he
will fight to-morrow?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No; but we have just
captured a fishing-boat conveying fish to Newcastle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And you have done very
wrong, my friends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> These
gentlemen from London are delicate, must have their first course;
you will put them sadly out of humor this evening, and to-morrow
they will be pitiless.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It
would really be in good taste to send back to Lambert both his
fish and his fishermen, unless - " and the general reflected an
instant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Tell me," continued he,
"what are these fishermen, if you please?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Some Picard seamen who
were fishing on the coasts of France or Holland, and who have
been thrown upon ours by a gale of wind."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do any among them speak
our language?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The leader spoke some
few words of English."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The mistrust of the
general was awakened in proportion as fresh information reached
him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "That is well," said
he.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I wish to see these
men; bring them to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> An officer immediately
went to fetch them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "How many are there of
them?" continued Monk; "and what is their vessel?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "There are ten or twelve
of them, general, and they were aboard of a kind of <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>chasse-mar&eacute;e</i>, as it is
called - Dutch-built, apparently."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And you say they were
carrying fish to Lambert's camp?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, general, and they
seem to have had good luck in their fishing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Humph!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We shall see that," said Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> At this moment the
officer returned, bringing the leader of the fishermen with
him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was a man from
fifty to fifty-five years old, but good-looking for his age.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was of middle height, and
wore a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>justaucorps</i> of
coarse wool, a cap pulled down over his eyes, a cutlass hung from
his belt, and he walked with the hesitation peculiar to sailors,
who, never knowing, thanks to the movement of the vessel, whether
their foot will be placed upon the plank or upon nothing, give to
every one of their steps a fall as firm as if they were driving a
pile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk, with an acute
and penetrating look, examined the fisherman for some time, while
the latter smiled, with that smile, half cunning, half silly,
peculiar to French peasants.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do you speak English?"
asked Monk, in excellent French.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! but badly, my
lord," replied the fisherman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This reply was made much
more with the lively and sharp accentuation of the people beyond
the Loire, than with the slightly-drawling accent of the
countries of the west and north of France.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But you do speak it?"
persisted Monk, in order to examine his accent once more.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Eh! we men of the sea,"
replied the fisherman, "speak a little of all languages."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Then you are a sea
fisherman?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am at present, my
lord - a fisherman, and a famous fisherman, too.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have taken a barbel that weighs at
least thirty pounds, and more than fifty mullets; I have also
some little whitings that will fry beautifully."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You appear to me to
have fished more frequently in the Gulf of Gascony than in the
Channel," said Monk, smiling.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, I am from the
south; but does that prevent me from being a good fisherman, my
lord?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! not at all; I shall
buy your fish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And now
speak frankly; for whom did you destine them?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My lord, I will conceal
nothing from you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I was
going to Newcastle, following the coast, when a party of horsemen
who were passing along in an opposite direction made a sign to my
bark to turn back to your honor's camp, under penalty of a
discharge of musketry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As
I was not armed for fighting," added the fisherman, smiling, "I
was forced to submit."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And why did you go to
Lambert's camp in preference to mine?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My lord, I will be
frank; will your lordship permit me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, and even if need
be shall command you to be so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, my lord, I was
going to M. Lambert's camp because those gentlemen from the city
pay well - whilst your Scotchmen, Puritans, Presbyterians,
Covenanters, or whatever you chose to call them, eat but little,
and pay for nothing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk shrugged his
shoulders, without, however, being able to refrain from smiling
at the same time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "How is
it that, being from the south, you come to fish on our
coasts?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Because I have been
fool enough to marry in Picardy."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes; but even Picardy
is not England."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My lord, man shoves his
boat into the sea, but God and the wind do the rest, and drive
the boat where they please."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You had, then, no
intention of landing on our coasts?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Never."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And what route were you
steering?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "We were returning from
Ostend, where some mackerel had already been seen, when a sharp
wind from the south drove us from our course; then, seeing that
it was useless to struggle against it, we let it drive us.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It then became necessary, not
to lose our fish, which were good, to go and sell them at the
nearest English port, and that was Newcastle.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We were told the opportunity was
good, as there was an increase of population in the camp, an
increase of population in the city; both, we were told, were full
of gentlemen, very rich and very hungry.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> So we steered our course towards
Newcastle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And your companions,
where are they?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, my companions have
remained on board; they are sailors without the least
instruction."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Whilst you - " said
Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Who, I?" said the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>patron</i>, laughing; "I have
sailed about with my father; and I know what is called a sou, a
crown, a pistole, a louis, and a double louis, in all the
languages of Europe; my crew, therefore, listen to me as they
would to an oracle, and obey me as if I were an admiral."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Then it was you who
preferred M. Lambert as the best customer?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, certainly.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And, to be frank, my lord, was
I wrong?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You will see that by
and by."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "At all events, my lord,
if there is a fault, the fault is mine; and my comrades should
not be dealt hardly with on that account."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "This is decidedly an
intelligent, sharp fellow," thought Monk.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then, after a few minutes' silence
employed in scrutinizing the fisherman, - "You come from Ostend,
did you not say?" asked the general.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, my lord, in a
straight line."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You have then heard of
the affairs of the day; for I have no doubt that both in France
and Holland they excite interest.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What is he doing who calls himself
king of England?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, my lord!" cried the
fisherman, with loud and expansive frankness, "that is a lucky
question, and you could not put it to anybody better than to me,
for in truth I can make you a famous reply.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Imagine, my lord, that when putting
into Ostend to sell the few mackerel we had caught, I saw the
ex-king walking on the downs waiting for his horses, which were
to take him to the Hague.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
He is a rather tall, pale man, with black hair, and somewhat
hard-featured.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He looks
ill, and I don't think the air of Holland agrees with him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk followed with the
greatest attention the rapid, heightened, and diffuse
conversation of the fisherman, in a language which was not his
own, but which, as we have said, he spoke with great
facility.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The fisherman,
on his part, employed sometimes a French word, sometimes an
English word, and sometimes a word which appeared not to belong
to any language, but was, in truth, pure Gascon.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fortunately his eyes spoke for him,
and that so eloquently, that it was possible to lose a word from
his mouth, but not a single intention from his eyes.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The general appeared more and more
satisfied with his examination.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "You must have heard that this
ex-king, as you call him, was going to the Hague for some
purpose?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, yes," said the
fisherman, "I heard that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And what was his
purpose?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Always the same," said
the fisherman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Must he
not always entertain the fixed idea of returning to England?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is true," said
Monk, pensively.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Without reckoning,"
added the fisherman, "that the stadtholder - you know, my lord,
William II.? - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He will assist him with
all his power."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! did you hear that
said?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, but I think
so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are quite a
politician, apparently," said Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why, we sailors, my
lord, who are accustomed to study the water and the air - that is
to say, the two most changeable things in the world - are seldom
deceived as to the rest."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Now, then," said Monk,
changing the conversation, "I am told you are going to provision
us."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

earnestly than ever at the fisherman, about whom he still
appeared to entertain some suspicion.<span style=

a piece of advice; for the two things are connected.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If you return, then, to General
Lambert - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The fisherman made a
movement of his head and shoulders, which signified, "If he
persists in it, I won't contradict him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do not cross the
marsh," continued Monk: "you will have money in your pocket, and
there are in the marsh some Scottish ambuscaders I have placed
there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Those people are
very intractable; they understand but very little of the language
which you speak, although it appears to me to be composed of
three languages.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They
might take from you what I have given you, and, on your return to
your country, you would not fail to say that General Monk has two
hands, the one Scottish, and the other English; and that he takes
back with the Scottish hand what he has given with the English
hand."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! general, I shall go
where you like, be sure of that," said the fisherman, with a fear
too expressive not to be exaggerated.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I only wish to remain here, if you
will allow me to remain."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I readily believe you,"
said Monk, with an imperceptible smile, "but I cannot,
nevertheless, keep you in my tent."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I have no such wish, my
lord, and desire only that your lordship should point out where
you will have me posted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Do not trouble yourself about us - with us a night soon passes
away."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "As your lordship
pleases.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Only, if your
lordship would allow me to be taken back by a carpenter, I should
be extremely grateful."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why so?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Because the gentlemen
of your army, in dragging my boat up the river with a cable
pulled by their horses, have battered it a little upon the rocks
of the shore, so that I have at least two feet of water in my
hold, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The greater reason why
you should watch your boat, I think."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My lord, I am quite at
your orders," said the fisherman; "I shall empty my baskets where
you wish; then you will pay me, if you please to do so; and you
will send me away, if it appears right to you.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You see I am very easily managed and
pleased, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Come, come, you are a
very good sort of fellow," said Monk, whose scrutinizing glance
had not been able to find a single shade in the clear eye of the
fisherman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Holloa,
Digby!"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> An aid-de-camp
appeared.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "You will
conduct this good fellow and his companions to the little tents
of the canteens, in front of the marshes, so that they will be
near their bark, and yet will not sleep on board to-night.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What is the matter,
Spithead?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Spithead was the
sergeant from whom Monk had borrowed a piece of tobacco for his
supper.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Spithead having
entered the general's tent without being sent for, had drawn this
question from Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My lord," said he, "a
French gentleman has just presented himself at the outposts and
wishes to speak to your honor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> All this was said, be it
understood, in English; but, notwithstanding, it produced a
slight emotion in the fisherman, which Monk, occupied with his
sergeant, did not remark.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Who is the gentleman?"
asked Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My lord," replied
Spithead, "he told it me; but those devils of French names are so
difficult to pronounce for a Scottish throat, that I could not
retain it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I believe,
however, from what the guards say, that it is the same gentleman
who presented himself yesterday at the halt, and whom your honor
would not receive."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is true; I was
holding a council of officers."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Will your honor give
any orders respecting this gentleman?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, let him be brought
here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Must we take any
precautions?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Such as what?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Blinding his eyes, for
instance?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To what purpose?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He can only see what I desire
should be seen; that is to say, that I have around me eleven
thousand brave men, who ask no better than to have their throats
cut in honor of the parliament of Scotland and England."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And this man, my lord?"
said Spithead, pointing to the fisherman, who, during this
conversation, had remained standing and motionless, like a man
who sees but does not understand.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah, that is true," said
Monk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then turning
towards the fisherman, - "I shall see you again, my brave
fellow," said he; "I have selected a lodging for you.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Digby, take him to it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fear nothing; your money shall be
sent to you presently."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Thank you, my lord,"
said the fisherman, and after having bowed, he left the tent,
accompanied by Digby.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Before he had gone a hundred paces he found his companions, who
were whispering with a volubility which did not appear exempt
from uneasiness, but he made them a sign which seemed to reassure
them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hol&agrave;</i> , you fellows!" said
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>patron</i>, "come this
way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His lordship,
General Monk, has the generosity to pay us for our fish, and the
goodness to give us hospitality for to-night."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The fishermen gathered
round their leader, and, conducted by Digby, the little troop
proceeded towards the canteens, the post, as may be remembered,
which had been assigned them.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As they went along in the dark, the
fishermen passed close to the guards who were conducting the
French gentleman to General Monk.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This gentleman was on horseback and
enveloped in a large cloak, which prevented the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>patron</i> from seeing him, however
great his curiosity might be.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As to the gentleman, ignorant that
he was elbowing compatriots, he did not pay any attention to the
little troop.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The aid-de-camp settled
his guests in a tolerably comfortable tent, from which was
dislodged an Irish canteen woman, who went, with her six
children, to sleep where she could.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A large fire was burning in front of
this tent, and threw its purple light over the grassy pools of
the marsh, rippled by a fresh breeze.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The arrangements made, the
aid-de-camp wished the fishermen good-night, calling to their
notice that they might see from the door of the tent the masts of
their bark, which was tossing gently on the Tweed, a proof that
it had not yet sunk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
sight of this appeared to delight the leader of the fishermen
infinitely.</p>

T</span>he French gentleman whom Spithead had announced to Monk,
and who, closely wrapped in his cloak, had passed by the
fishermen who left the general's tent five minutes before he
entered it, - the French gentleman went through the various posts
without even casting his eyes around him, for fear of appearing
indiscreet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As the order
had been given, he was conducted to the tent of the general.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The gentleman was left alone
in the sort of ante-chamber in front of the principal body of the
tent, where he awaited Monk, who only delayed till he had heard
the report of his people, and observed through the opening of the
canvas the countenance of the person who solicited an
audience.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Without doubt, the
report of those who had accompanied the French gentleman
established the discretion with which he had behaved, for the
first impression the stranger received of the welcome made him by
the general was more favorable than he could have expected at
such a moment, and on the part of so suspicious a man.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Nevertheless, according to his
custom, when Monk found himself in the presence of a stranger, he
fixed upon him his penetrating eyes, which scrutiny, the
stranger, on his part, sustained without embarrassment or
notice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the end of a
few seconds, the general made a gesture with his hand and head in
sign of attention.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My lord," said the
gentleman, in excellent English, "I have requested an interview
with your honor, for an affair of importance."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur," replied
Monk, in French, "you speak our language well for a son of the
continent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I ask your
pardon - for doubtless the question is indiscreet - do you speak
French with the same purity?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "There is nothing
surprising, my lord, in my speaking English tolerably; I resided
for some time in England in my youth, and since then I have made
two voyages to this country."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> These words were spoken in French,
and with a purity of accent that bespoke not only a Frenchman,
but a Frenchman from the vicinity of Tours.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And what part of
England have you resided in, monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In my youth, London, my
lord; then, about 1635, I made a pleasure trip to Scotland; and
lastly, in 1648, I lived for some time at Newcastle, particularly
in the convent, the gardens of which are now occupied by your
army."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Excuse me, monsieur;
but you must comprehend that these questions are necessary on my
part - do you not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It would astonish me,
my lord, if they were not asked."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Now, then, monsieur,
what can I do to serve you?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What do you wish?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "This, my lord; - but,
in the first place, are we alone?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Perfectly so, monsieur,
except, of course, the post which guards us."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> So saying, Monk pulled open the
canvas with his hand, and pointed to the soldier placed at ten
paces from the tent, and who, at the first call, could have
rendered assistance in a second.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In that case, my lord,"
said the gentleman, in as calm a tone as if he had been for a
length of time in habits of intimacy with his interlocutor, "I
have made up my mind to address myself to you, because I believe
you to be an honest man.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Indeed, the communication I am about to make to you will prove to
you the esteem in which I hold you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk, astonished at this
language, which established between him and the French gentleman
equality at least,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> raised
his piercing eye to the stranger's face, and with a sensible
irony conveyed by the inflection of his voice alone, for not a
muscle of his face moved, - "I thank you, monsieur," said he;
"but, in the first place, to whom have I the honor of
speaking?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I sent you my name by
your sergeant, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Excuse him, monsieur,
he is a Scotsman, - he could not retain it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am called the Comte
de la F&egrave;re, monsieur," said Athos, bowing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The Comte de la
F&egrave;re?" said Monk, endeavoring to recollect the name.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Pardon me, monsieur, but this
appears to be the first time I have ever heard that name.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do you fill any post at the
court of France?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "None; I am a simple
gentleman."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What dignity?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "King Charles I. made me
a knight of the Garter, and Queen Anne of Austria has given me
the cordon of the Holy Ghost.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> These are my only dignities."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The Garter! the Holy
Ghost!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Are you a knight
of those two orders, monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And on what occasions
have such favors been bestowed upon you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "For services rendered
to their majesties."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk looked with
astonishment at this man, who appeared to him so simple and so
great at the same time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Then, as if he had renounced endeavoring to penetrate this
mystery of a simplicity and grandeur upon which the stranger did
not seem disposed to give him any other information than that
which he had already received, - "Did you present yourself
yesterday at our advanced posts?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And was sent back?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Yes, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Many officers,
monsieur, would permit no one to enter their camp, particularly
on the eve of a probable battle.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But I differ from my colleagues, and
like to leave nothing behind me.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Every advice is good to me; all
danger is sent to me by God, and I weigh it in my hand with the
energy He has given me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
So, yesterday, you were only sent back on account of the council
I was holding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To-day I
am at liberty, - speak."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My lord, you have done
much better in receiving me, for what I have to say has nothing
to do with the battle you are about to fight with General
Lambert, or with your camp; and the proof is, that I turned away
my head that I might not see your men, and closed my eyes that I
might not count your tents.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No, I came to speak to you, my lord,
on my own account."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Speak then, monsieur,"
said Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Just now," continued
Athos, "I had the honor of telling your lordship that for a long
time I lived in Newcastle; it was in the time of Charles I., and
when the king was given up to Cromwell by the Scots."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I know," said Monk,
coldly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I had at that time a
large sum in gold, and on the eve of the battle, from a
presentiment perhaps of the turn which things would take on the
morrow, I concealed it in the principal vault of the covenant of
Newcastle, in the tower whose summit you now see silvered by the
moonbeams.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> My treasure
has then remained interred there, and I have come to entreat your
honor to permit me to withdraw it before, perhaps, the battle
turning that way, a mine or some other war engine has destroyed
the building and scattered my gold, or rendered it so apparent
that the soldiers will take possession of it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk was well acquainted
with mankind; he saw in the physiognomy of this gentleman all the
energy, all the reason, all the circumspection possible; he could
therefore only attribute to a magnanimous confidence the
revelation the Frenchman had made him, and he showed himself
profoundly touched by it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur," said he,
"you have augured well of me.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But is the sum worth the trouble to
which you expose yourself?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do you even believe that it can be
in the same place where you left it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is there monsieur, I
do not doubt."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is a reply to one
question; but to the other.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I asked you if the sum was so large
as to warrant your exposing yourself thus."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is really large;
yes, my lord, for it is a million I inclosed in two barrels."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A million!" cried Monk,
at whom this time, in turn, Athos looked earnestly and long.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk perceived this, and his
mistrust returned.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Here is a man," said he
to himself, "who is laying a snare for me.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> So you wish to withdraw this money,
monsieur," replied he, "as I understand?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "If you please, my
lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To-day?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "This very evening, and
that on account of the circumstances I have named."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But, monsieur,"
objected Monk, "General Lambert is as near the abbey where you
have to act as I am.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Why,
then, have you not addressed yourself to him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Because, my lord, when
one acts in important matters, it is best to consult one's
instinct before everything.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well, General Lambert does not
inspire with me so much confidence as you do."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Be it so,
monsieur.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I shall assist
you in recovering your money, if, however, it can still be there;
for that is far from likely.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Since 1648 twelve years have rolled
away, and many events have taken place."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk dwelt upon this point to see if
the French gentleman would seize the evasions that were open to
him, but Athos did not hesitate.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I assure you, my lord,"
he said firmly, "that my conviction is, that the two barrels have
neither changed place nor master."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This reply had removed one suspicion
from the mind of Monk, but it had suggested another.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Without doubt this Frenchman was
some emissary sent to entice into error the protector of the
parliament; the gold was nothing but a lure; and by the help of
this lure they thought to excite the cupidity of the
general.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This gold might
not exist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was Monk's
business, then, to seize the Frenchman in the act of falsehood
and trick, and to draw from the false step itself in which his
enemies wished to entrap him, a triumph for his renown.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When Monk was determined how
to act, -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur," said he to
Athos, "without doubt you will do me the honor to share my supper
this evening?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, my lord," replied
Athos, bowing; "for you do me an honor of which I feel myself
worthy, by the inclination which drew me towards you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is so much the more
gracious on your part to accept my invitation with such
frankness, as my cooks are but few and inexperienced, and my
providers have returned this evening empty-handed; so that if it
had not been for a fisherman of your nation who strayed into our
camp, General Monk would have gone to bed without his supper
to-day; I have, then, some fresh fish to offer you, as the vendor
assures me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My lord, it is
principally for the sake of having the honor to pass an hour with
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> After this exchange of
civilities, during which Monk had lost nothing of his
circumspection, the supper, or what was to serve for one, had
been laid upon a deal table.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk invited the Comte de la
F&egrave;re to be seated at this table, and took his place
opposite to him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A single
dish of boiled fish, set before the two illustrious guests, was
more tempting to hungry stomachs than to delicate palates.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Whilst supping, that is,
while eating the fish, washed down with bad ale, Monk got Athos
to relate to him the last events of the Fronde, the
reconciliation of M. de Cond&eacute; with the king, and the
probable marriage of the infanta of Spain; but he avoided, as
Athos himself avoided it, all allusion to the political interests
which united, or rather which disunited at this time, England,
France and Holland.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk, in this
conversation, convinced himself of one thing, which he must have
remarked after the first words exchanged: that was, that he had
to deal with a man of high distinction.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He could not be an assassin, and it
was repugnant to Monk to believe him to be a spy; but there was
sufficient <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>finesse</i> and
at the same time firmness in Athos to lead Monk to fancy he was a
conspirator.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When they
had quitted the table, "You still believe in your treasure, then,
monsieur?" asked Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Quite seriously?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Seriously."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And you think you can
find the place again where it was buried?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "At the first
inspection."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, monsieur, from
curiosity I shall accompany you.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And it is so much the more necessary
that I should accompany you, that you would find great
difficulties in passing through the camp without me or one of my
lieutenants."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "General, I would not
suffer you to inconvenience yourself if I did not, in fact, stand
in need of your company; but as I recognize that this company is
not only honorable, but necessary, I accept it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do you desire we should
take any people with us?" asked Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "General, I believe that
would be useless, if you yourself do not see the necessity for
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Two men and a horse
will suffice to transport the two casks on board the felucca
which brought me hither."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But it will be
necessary to pick, dig, and remove the earth, and split stones;
you don't intend doing this work yourself, monsieur, do you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "General, there is no
picking or digging required.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The treasure is buried in the
sepulchral vault of the convent, under a stone in which is fixed
a large iron ring, and under which there are four steps leading
down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The two casks are
there, placed end to end, covered with a coat of plaster in the
form of a bier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There is,
besides, an inscription, which will enable me to recognize the
stone; and as I am not willing, in an affair of delicacy and
confidence, to keep the secret from your honor, here is the
inscription: - '<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hic jacet

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk did not lose a
single word.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was
astonished either at the marvelous duplicity of this man and the
superior style in which he played his part, or at the good loyal
faith with which he presented his request, in a situation in
which concerning a million of money, risked against the blow from
a dagger, amidst an army that would have looked upon the theft as
a restitution.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very well," said he; "I
shall accompany you; and the adventure appears to me so
wonderful, that I shall carry the torch myself."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And saying these words, he girded on
a short sword, placed a pistol in his belt, disclosing in this
movement, which opened his doublet a little, the fine rings of a
coat of mail, destined to protect him from the first
dagger-thrust of an assassin.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> After which he took a Scottish dirk
in his left hand, and then turning to Athos, "Are you ready,
monsieur?" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Athos, as if in
opposition to what Monk had done, unfastened his poniard, which
he placed upon the table; unhooked his sword-belt, which he laid
close to his poniard; and, without affectation, opening his
doublet as if to look for his handkerchief, showed beneath his
fine cambric shirt his naked breast, without weapons either
offensive or defensive.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "This is truly a
singular man," said Monk; "he is without any arms; he has an
ambuscade placed somewhere yonder."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "General," said he, as
if he had divined Monk's thought, "you wish we should be alone;
that is very right, but a great captain ought never to expose
himself with temerity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It
is night, the passage of the marsh may present dangers; be
accompanied."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are right," replied
he, calling Digby.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
aid-de-camp appeared.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Fifty men with swords and muskets," said he, looking at
Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is too few if
there is danger, too many if there is not."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

A</span>thos and Monk passed over, in going from the camp towards
the Tweed, that part of the ground which Digby had traversed with
the fishermen coming from the Tweed to the camp.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The aspect of this place, the aspect
of the changes man had wrought in it, was of a nature to produce
a great effect upon a lively and delicate imagination like that
of Athos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos looked at
nothing but these desolate spots; Monk looked at nothing but
Athos - at Athos, who, with his eyes sometimes directed towards
heaven, and sometimes towards the earth, sought, thought, and
sighed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Digby, whom the last
orders of the general, and particularly the accent with which he
had given them, had at first a little excited, Digby followed the
pair at about twenty paces, but the general having turned round
as if astonished to find his orders had not been obeyed, the
aid-de-camp perceived his indiscretion, and returned to his
tent.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> He supposed that the
general wished to make, incognito, one of those reviews of
vigilance which every experienced captain never fails to make on
the eve of a decisive engagement: he explained to himself the
presence of Athos in this case as an inferior explains all that
is mysterious on the part of his leader.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos might be, and, indeed, in the
eyes of Digby, must be, a spy, whose information was to enlighten
the general.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> At the end of a walk of
about ten minutes among the tents and posts, which were closer
together near the headquarters, Monk entered upon a little
causeway which diverged into three branches.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That on the left led to the river,
that in the middle to Newcastle Abbey on the marsh, that on the
right crossed the first lines of Monk's camp; that is to say, the
lines nearest to Lambert's army.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Beyond the river was an advanced
post, belonging to Monk's army, which watched the enemy; it was
composed of one hundred and fifty Scots.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They had swum across the Tweed, and,
in case of attack, were to recross it in the same manner, giving
the alarm; but as there was no post at that spot, and as
Lambert's soldiers were not so prompt at taking to the water as
Monk's were, the latter appeared not to have as much uneasiness
on that side.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On this
side of the river, at about five hundred paces from the old
abbey, the fishermen had taken up their abode amidst a crowd of
small tents raised by soldiers of the neighboring clans, who had
with them their wives and children.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> All this confusion, seen by the
moon's light, presented a striking <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>coup d'&oelig;il</i>; the half
shadow enlarged every detail, and the light, that flatterer which
only attaches itself to the polished side of things, courted upon
each rusty musket the point still left intact, and upon every rag
of canvas the whitest and least sullied part.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk arrived then with
Athos, crossing this spot, illumined with a double light, the
silver splendor of the moon, and the red blaze of the fires at
the meeting of these three causeways; there he stopped, and
addressing his companion, - "Monsieur," said he, "do you know
your road?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "General, if I am not
mistaken, the middle causeway leads straight to the abbey."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is right; but we
shall want lights to guide us in the vaults."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk turned round.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I thought Digby was following us!"
said he.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "So much the
better; he will procure us what we want."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, general, there is
a man yonder who has been walking behind us for some time."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Digby!" cried
Monk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Digby! come here,
if you please."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> But instead of obeying,
the shadow made a motion of surprise, and, retreating instead of
advancing, it bent down and disappeared along the jetty on the
left, directing its course towards the lodging of the
fishermen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It appears not to be
Digby," said Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Both had followed the
shadow which had vanished.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But it was not so rare a thing for a
man to be wandering about at eleven o'clock at night, in a camp
in which are reposing ten or eleven thousand men, as to give Monk
and Athos any alarm at his disappearance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "As it is so," said
Monk, "and we must have a light, a lantern, a torch, or something
by which we may see where to see our feet; let us seek this
light."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "General, the first
soldier we meet will light us."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No," said Monk, in
order to discover if there were not any connivance between the
Comte de la F&egrave;re and the fisherman.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "No, I should prefer one of these
French sailors who came this evening to sell me their fish.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They leave to-morrow, and the
secret will be better kept by them; whereas, if a report should
be spread in the Scottish army, that treasures are to be found in
the abbey of Newcastle, my Highlanders will believe there is a
million concealed beneath every slab, and they will not leave
stone upon stone in the building."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do as you think best,
general," replied Athos, in a natural tone of voice, making
evident that soldier or fisherman was the same to him, and that
he had no preference.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk approached the
causeway behind which had disappeared the person he had taken for
Digby, and met a patrol who, making the tour of the tents, was
going towards headquarters; he was stopped with his companion,
gave the password, and went on.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A soldier, roused by the noise,
unrolled his plaid, and looked up to see what was going
forward.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Ask him," said
Monk to Athos, "where the fishermen are; if I were to speak to
him, he would know me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Athos went up to the
soldier, who pointed out the tent to him; immediately Monk and
Athos turned towards it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
It appeared to the general that at the moment they came up, a
shadow like that they had already seen, glided into this tent;
but on drawing nearer he perceived he must have been mistaken,
for all of them were asleep <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>p&ecirc;le m&ecirc;le</i>, and
nothing was seen but arms and legs joined, crossed, and
mixed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos, fearing
lest he should be suspected of connivance with some of his
compatriots, remained outside the tent.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hol&agrave;!</i>" said Monk, in
French, "wake up here."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Two or three of the sleepers got up.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I want a man to light
me," continued Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your honor may depend
on us," said a voice which made Athos start.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Where do you wish us to go?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You shall see.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A light! come, quickly!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, your honor.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Does it please your honor that
I should accompany you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You or another; it is
of very little consequence, provided I have a light."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is strange!" thought
Athos; "what a singular voice that man has!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Some fire, you
fellows!" cried the fisherman; "come, make haste!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Then addressing his
companion nearest to him in a low voice: - "Get ready a light,
Menneville," said he, "and hold yourself ready for anything."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> One of the fishermen
struck light from a stone, set fire to some tinder, and by the
aid of a match lit a lantern.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The light immediately spread all
over the tent.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Are you ready,
monsieur?" said Monk to Athos, who had turned away, not to expose
his face to the light.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, general," replied
he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! the French
gentleman!" said the leader of the fishermen to himself.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Peste!</i><span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have a great mind to charge you
with the commission, Menneville; he may know me.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Light! light!"<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This dialogue was pronounced at the
back of the tent, and in so low a voice that Monk could not hear
a syllable of it; he was, besides, talking with Athos.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Menneville got himself ready
in the meantime, or rather received the orders of his leader.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well?" said Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am ready, general,"
said the fisherman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk, Athos, and the
fisherman left the tent.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is impossible!"
thought Athos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "What
dream could put that into my head?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Go forward; follow the
middle causeway, and stretch out your legs," said Monk to the
fisherman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> They were not twenty
paces on their way when the same shadow that had appeared to
enter the tent came out of it again, crawled along as far as the
piles, and, protected by that sort of parapet placed along the
causeway, carefully observed the march of the general.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> All three disappeared in the
night haze.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They were
walking towards Newcastle, the white stones of which appeared to
them like sepulchers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
After standing for a few seconds under the porch, they penetrated
into the interior.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
door had been broken open by hatchets.<span style=

in a corner, so certain were they that the attack would not take
place on that side.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Will not these men be
in your way?" said Monk to Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "On the contrary,
monsieur, they will assist in rolling out the barrels, if your
honor will permit them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are right."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The post, though fast
asleep, roused up at the first steps of the three visitors
amongst the briars and grass that invaded the porch.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk gave the password, and
penetrated into the interior of the convent, preceded by the
light.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He walked last,
watching the least movement of Athos, his naked dirk in his
sleeve, and ready to plunge it into the back of the gentleman at
the first suspicious gesture he should see him make.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But Athos, with a firm and sure
step, crossed the chambers and courts.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Not a door, not a window
was left in the building.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The doors had been burnt, some on the spot, and the charcoal of
them was still jagged with the action of the fire, which had gone
out of itself, powerless, no doubt, to get to the heart of those
massive joints of oak fastened together with iron nails.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As to the windows, all the
panes having been broken, night birds, alarmed by the torch, flew
away through their holes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
At the same time, gigantic bats began to trace their vast, silent
circles around the intruders, whilst the light of the torch made
their shadows tremble on the high stone walls.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk concluded that there could be
no man in the convent, since wild beasts and birds were there
still, and fled away at his approach.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> After having passed the
rubbish, and torn away more than one branch of ivy that had made
itself a guardian of the solitude, Athos arrived at the vaults
situated beneath the great hall, but the entrance of which was
from the chapel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There he
stopped.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Here we are,
general," said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "This, then, is the
slab?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ay, and here is the
ring - but the ring is sealed into the stone."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "We must have a
lever."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That's a very easy
thing to find."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Whilst looking around
them, Athos and Monk perceived a little ash of about three inches
in diameter, which had shot up in an angle of the wall, reaching
a window, concealed by its branches.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Have you a knife?" said
Monk to the fisherman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Cut down this tree,
then."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The fisherman obeyed,
but not without notching his cutlass.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When the ash was cut and fashioned
into the shape of a lever, the three men penetrated into the
vault.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Stop where you are,"
said Monk to the fisherman.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "We are going to dig up some powder;
your light may be dangerous."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The man drew back in a
sort of terror, and faithfully kept to the post assigned him,
whilst Monk and Athos turned behind a column at the foot of
which, penetrating through a crack, was a moonbeam, reflected
exactly on the stone which the Comte de la F&egrave;re had come
so far in search.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "This is it," said
Athos, pointing out to the general the Latin inscription.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes," said Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Then, as if still
willing to leave the Frenchman one means of evasion, -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do you not observe that
this vault has already been broken into," continued he, "and that
several statues have already been knocked down?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My lord, you have,
without doubt, heard that the religious respect of your Scots
loves to confide to the statues of the dead the valuable objects
they have possessed during their lives.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Therefore, the soldiers had reason
to think that under the pedestals of the statues which ornament
most of these tombs, a treasure was hidden.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They have consequently broken down
pedestal and statue: but the tomb of the venerable cannon, with
which we have to do, is not distinguished by any monument.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is simple, therefore it has
been protected by superstitious the fear which your Puritans have
always had of sacrilege.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Not a morsel of the masonry of this tomb has been chipped
off."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is true," said
Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Athos seized the
lever.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Shall I help you?" said
Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Thank you, my lord; but
I am not willing that your honor should lend your hand to a work
of which, perhaps, you would not take the responsibility if you
knew the probable consequences of it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk raised his
head.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What do you mean by
that, monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I mean - but that man -
"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Stop," said Monk; "I
perceive what you are afraid of.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I shall make a trial."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk turned towards the fisherman,
the whole of whose profile was thrown upon the wall.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Come here, friend!"
said he in English, and in a tone of command.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The fisherman did not
stir.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is well,"
continued he: "he does not know English.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Speak to me, then, in English, if
you please, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My lord," replied
Athos, "I have frequently seen men in certain circumstances have
sufficient command over themselves not to reply to a question put
to them in a language they understood.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The fisherman is perhaps more
learned than we believe him to be.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Send him away, my lord, I beg
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Decidedly," said Monk,
"he wishes to have me alone in this vault.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Never mind, we shall go through with
it; one man is as good as another man; and we are alone.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> My friend," said Monk to the
fisherman, "go back up the stairs we have just descended, and
watch that nobody comes to disturb us."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The fisherman made a sign of
obedience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Leave your
torch," said Monk; "it would betray your presence, and might
procure you a musket-ball."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The fisherman appeared
to appreciate the counsel; he laid down the light, and
disappeared under the vault of the stairs.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk took up the torch, and brought
it to the foot of the column.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah, ah!" said he;
"money, then, is concealed under this tomb?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, my lord; and in
five minutes you will no longer doubt it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> At the same time Athos
struck a violent blow upon the plaster, which split, presenting a
chink for the point of the lever.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos introduced the bar into this
crack, and soon large pieces of plaster yielded, rising up like
rounded slabs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then the
Comte de la F&egrave;re seized the stones and threw them away
with a force that hands so delicate as his might not have been
supposed capable of having.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My lord," said Athos,
"this is plainly the masonry of which I told your honor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes; but I do not yet
see the casks," said Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "If I had a dagger,"
said Athos, looking round him, "you should soon see them,
monsieur.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Unfortunately,
I left mine in your tent."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I would willingly offer
you mine," said Monk, "but the blade is too thin for such
work."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Athos appeared to look
around him for a thing of some kind that might serve as a
substitute for the weapon he desired.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk did not lose one of the
movements of his hands, or one of the expressions of his
eyes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Why do you not ask
the fisherman for his cutlass?" said Monk; "he has a
cutlass."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! that is true," said
Athos; "for he cut the tree down with it."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he advanced towards the
stairs.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Friend," said he to the
fisherman, "throw me down your cutlass, if you please; I want
it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The noise of the falling
weapon sounded on the steps.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Take it," said Monk;
"it is a solid instrument, as I have seen, and a strong hand
might make good use of it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Athos appeared only to
give to the words of Monk the natural and simple sense under
which they were to be heard and understood.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Nor did he remark, or at least
appear to remark, that when he returned with the weapon, Monk
drew back, placing his left hand on the stock of his pistol; in
the right he already held his dirk.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He went to work then, turning his
back to Monk, placing his life in his hands, without possible
defense.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He then struck,
during several seconds, so skillfully and sharply upon the
intermediary plaster, that it separated into two parts, and Monk
was able to discern two barrels placed end to end, and which
their weight maintained motionless in their chalky envelope.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My lord," said Athos,
"you see that my presentiments have not been disappointed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, monsieur," said
Monk, "and I have good reason to believe you are satisfied; are
you not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Doubtless I am; the
loss of this money would have been inexpressibly great to me: but
I was certain that God, who protects the good cause, would not
have permitted this gold, which should procure its triumph, to be
diverted to baser purposes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are, upon my honor,
as mysterious in your words as in your actions, monsieur," said
Monk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Just now as I did
not perfectly understand you when you said that you were not
willing to throw upon me the responsibility of the work we were
accomplishing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I had reason to say so,
my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And now you speak to me
of the good cause.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What
do you mean by the words 'the good cause?'<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We are defending at this moment, in
England, five or six causes, which does not prevent every one
from considering his own not only as the good cause, but as the
best.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What is yours,
monsieur?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Speak boldly,
that we may see if, upon this point, to which you appear to
attach a great importance, we are of the same opinion."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Athos fixed upon Monk
one of those penetrating looks which seemed to convey to him to
whom they are directed a challenge to conceal a single one of his
thoughts; then, taking off his hat, he began in a solemn voice,
while his interlocutor, with one hand upon his visage, allowed
that long and nervous hand to compress his mustache and beard,
while his vague and melancholy eye wandered about the recesses of
the vaults.</p>

"M</span>y lord," said the Comte de la F&egrave;re, "you are an
noble Englishman, you are a loyal man; you are speaking to a
noble Frenchman, to a man of heart.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The gold contained in these two
casks before us, I have told you was mine.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I was wrong - it is the first lie I
have pronounced in my life, a temporary lie, it is true.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This gold is the property of
King Charles II., exiled from his country, driven from his
palaces, the orphan at once of his father and his throne, and
deprived of everything, even of the melancholy happiness of
kissing on his knees the stone upon which the hands of his
murderers have written that simple epitaph which will eternally
cry out for vengeance upon them: -'HERE LIES CHARLES I.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk grew slightly pale,
and an imperceptible shudder crept over his skin and raised his
gray mustache.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I," continued Athos,
"I, Comte de la F&egrave;re, the last, only faithful friend the
poor abandoned prince has left, I have offered him to come hither
to find the man upon whom now depends the fate of royalty and of
England; and I have come, and placed myself under the eye of this
man, and have placed myself naked and unarmed in his hands,
saying: - 'My lord, here are the last resources of a prince whom
God made your master, whom his birth made your king; upon you,
and you alone, depend his life and future.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Will you employ this money in
consoling England for the evils it must have suffered from
anarchy; that is to say, will you aid, and if not aid, will you
allow King Charles II. to act?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You are master, you are king,
all-powerful master and king, for chance sometimes defeats the
work of time and God.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I
am here alone with you, my lord: if divided success alarms you,
if my complicity annoys you, you are armed, my lord, and here is
a grave ready dug; if, on the contrary, the enthusiasm of your
cause carries you away, if you are what you appear to be, if your
hand in what it undertakes obeys your mind, and your mind your
heart, here are the means of ruining forever the cause of your
enemy, Charles Stuart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Kill, then, the man you have before you, for that man will never
return to him who has sent him without bearing with him the
deposit which Charles I., his father, confided to him, and keep
the gold which may assist in carrying on the civil war.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Alas! my lord, it is the fate
of this unfortunate prince. <span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He must either corrupt or kill, for
everything resists him, everything repulses him, everything is
hostile to him; and yet he is marked with divine seal, and he
must, not to belie his blood, reascend the throne, or die upon
the sacred soil of his country.'</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My lord, you have heard
me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To any other but the
illustrious man who listens to me, I would have said: 'My lord,
you are poor; my lord, the king offers you this million as an
earnest of an immense bargain; take it, and serve Charles II. as
I served Charles I., and I feel assured that God, who listens to
us, who sees us, who alone reads in your heart, shut up from all
human eyes, - I am assured God will give you a happy eternal life
after death.'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But to
General Monk, to the illustrious man of whose standard I believe
I have taken measure, I say: 'My lord, there is for you in the
history of peoples and kings a brilliant place, an immortal,
imperishable glory, if alone, without any other interest but the
good of your country and the interests of justice, you become the
supporter of your king.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Many others have been conquerors and glorious usurpers; you, my
lord, you will be content with being the most virtuous, the most
honest, and the most incorruptible of men: you will have held a
crown in your hand, and instead of placing it upon your own brow,
you will have deposited it upon the head of him for whom it was
made.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh, my lord, act
thus, and you will leave to posterity the most enviable of names,
in which no human creature can rival you.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Athos stopped.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> During the whole time that the
noble gentleman was speaking, Monk had not given one sign of
either approbation or disapprobation; scarcely even, during this
vehement appeal, had his eyes been animated with that fire which
bespeaks intelligence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The Comte de la F&egrave;re looked at him sorrowfully, and on
seeing that melancholy countenance, felt discouragement penetrate
to his very heart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At
length Monk appeared to recover, and broke the silence.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur," said he, in
a mild, calm tone, "in reply to you, I will make use of your own
words.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To any other but
yourself I would reply by expulsion, imprisonment, or still
worse, for, in fact, you tempt me and you force me at the same
time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But you are one of
those men, monsieur, to whom it is impossible to refuse the
attention and respect they merit; you are a brave gentleman,
monsieur - I say so, and I am a judge.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You just now spoke of a deposit
which the late king transmitted through you to his son - are you,
then, one of those Frenchmen who, as I have heard, endeavored to
carry off Charles I. from Whitehall?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, my lord; it was I
who was beneath the scaffold during the execution; I, who had not
been able to redeem it, received upon my brow the blood of the
martyred king.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I
received, at the same time, the last word of Charles I.; it was
to me he said, 'REMEMBER!' and in saying, 'Remember!' he alluded
to the money at your feet, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I have heard much of
you, monsieur," said Monk, "but I am happy to have, in the first
place, appreciated you by my own observations, and not by my
remembrances.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I will give
you, then, explanations that I have given to no other, and you
will appreciate what a distinction I make between you and the
persons who have hitherto been sent to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Athos bowed and prepared
to absorb greedily the words which fell, one by one, from the
mouth of Monk, - those words rare and precious as the dew in the
desert.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You spoke to me," said
Monk, "of Charles II.; but pray, monsieur, of what consequence to
me is that phantom of a king?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have grown old in a war and in a
policy which are nowadays so closely linked together, that every
man of the sword must fight in virtue of his rights or his
ambition with a personal interest, and not blindly behind an
officer, as in ordinary wars.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> For myself, I perhaps desire
nothing, but I fear much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
In the war of to-day rests the liberty of England, and, perhaps,
that of every Englishman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
How can you expect that I, free in the position I have made for
myself, should go willingly and hold out my hands to the shackles
of a stranger?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That is
all Charles is to me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He
has fought battles here which he has lost, he is therefore a bad
captain; he has succeeded in no negotiation, he is therefore a
bad diplomatist; he has paraded his wants and his miseries in all
the courts of Europe, he has therefore a weak and pusillanimous
heart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Nothing noble,
nothing great, nothing strong has hitherto emanated from that
genius which aspires to govern one of the greatest kingdoms of
the earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I know this
Charles, then, under none but bad aspects, and you would wish me,
a man of good sense, to go and make myself gratuitously the slave

politics, and in dignity!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
No, monsieur.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When some
great and noble action shall have taught me to value Charles, I
shall perhaps recognize his rights to a throne from which we cast
the father because he wanted the virtues which his son has
hitherto lacked, but, in fact of rights, I only recognize my own;
the revolution made me a general, my sword will make me
protector, if I wish it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Let Charles show himself, let him present himself, let him enter
the competition open to genius, and, above all, let him remember
that he is of a race from whom more will be expected than from
any other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Therefore,
monsieur, say no more about him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I neither refuse nor accept: I
reserve myself - I wait."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Athos knew Monk to be
too well informed of all concerning Charles to venture to urge
the discussion further; it was neither the time nor the
place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "My lord," then
said he, "I have nothing to do but thank you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And why, monsieur?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Because you have formed a
correct opinion of me, or because I have acted according to your
judgment?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Is that, in
truth, worthy of thanks?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
This gold which you are about to carry to Charles will serve me
as a test for him, by seeing the use he will make of it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I shall have an opinion which
now I have not."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And yet does not your
honor fear to compromise yourself by allowing such a sum to be

style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Eh, monsieur, I have no
enemies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am in the
service of the parliament, which orders me to fight General
Lambert and Charles Stuart - its enemies, and not mine.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I fight them.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If the parliament, on the contrary,
ordered me to unfurl my standards on the port of London, and to
assemble my soldiers on the banks to receive Charles II. - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You would obey?" cried
Athos, joyfully.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Pardon me," said Monk,
smiling, "I was going on - I, a gray-headed man - in truth, how
could I forget myself? was going to speak like a foolish young
man."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Then you would not
obey?" said Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

either, monsieur.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
welfare of my country before everything.<span style=

has, no doubt, willed that I should have that power for the good
of all, and He has given me, at the same time, discernment.<span

order such a thing, I should reflect."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The brow of Athos became
clouded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Then I may
positively say that your honor is not inclined to favor King
Charles II.?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

God inspire you with the idea of replying to me as frankly as I
shall reply to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "When you shall have
taken this money back to your prince, what advice will you give
him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Athos fixed upon Monk a
proud and resolute look.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My lord," said he,
"with this million, which others would perhaps employ in
negotiating, I would advise the king to rise two regiments, to
enter Scotland, which you have just pacified: to give to the
people the franchises which the revolution promised them, and in
which it has not, in all cases, kept its word.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I should advise him to command in
person this little army, which would, believe me, increase, and
to die, standard in hand, and sword in sheath, saying,
'Englishmen!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am the
third king of my race you have killed; beware of the justice of
God!'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk hung down his head,
and mused for an instant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"If he succeeded," said he, "which is very improbable, but not
impossible - for everything is possible in this world - what
would you advise him to do?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To think that by the
will of God he lost his crown, by the good will of men he
recovered it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> An ironical smile passed
over the lips of Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Unfortunately,
monsieur," said he, "kings do not know how to follow good
advice."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah, my lord, Charles
II. is not a king," replied Athos, smiling in his turn, but with
a very different expression from Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Let us terminate this,
monsieur le comte, - that is your desire, is it not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In a little hamlet at
the mouth of the river, your honor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

it consists of five or six houses, does it not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Exactly.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well, I inhabit the first, - two
net-makers occupy it with me; it is their bark which brought me
ashore."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

a quarter of a mile at sea, and waits for me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

however, of setting out immediately?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

once more to convince your honor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You will not succeed,"
replied Monk; "but it is of consequence that you should depart
from Newcastle without leaving of your passage the least
suspicion that might prove injurious to me or you.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To-morrow my officers think Lambert
will attack me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I, on the
contrary, am convinced he will not stir; it is in my opinion
impossible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Lambert leads
an army devoid of homogeneous principles, and there is no
possible army with such elements.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have taught my soldiers to
consider my authority subordinate to another, therefore, after
me, round me, and beneath me, they still look for something.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It would result that if I were
dead, whatever might happen, my army would not be demoralized all
at once; it results, that if I choose to absent myself, for
instance, as it does please me to do sometimes, there would not
be in the camp the shadow of uneasiness or disorder.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am the magnet - the sympathetic
and natural strength of the English.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> All those scattered irons that will
be sent against me I shall attract to myself.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Lambert, at this moment, commands
eighteen thousand deserters; but I have never mentioned that to
my officers, you may easily suppose.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Nothing is more useful to an army
than the expectation of a coming battle; everybody is awake -
everybody is on guard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I
tell you this that you may live in perfect security.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do not be in a hurry, then, to cross
the seas; within a week there will be something fresh, either a
battle or an accommodation.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then, as you have judged me to be an
honorable man, and confided your secret to me, I have to thank
you for this confidence, and I shall come and pay you a visit or
send for you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do not go
before I send word.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I
repeat the request."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I promise you,
general," cried Athos, with a joy so great, that in spite of all
his circumspection, he could not prevent its sparkling in his
eyes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk surprised this
flash, and immediately extinguished it by one of those silent
smiles which always caused his interlocutors to know they had
made no inroad on his mind.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Then, my lord, it is a
week that you desire me to wait?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

what shall I do?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "If there should be a
battle, keep at a distance from it, I beseech you.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I know the French delight in such
amusements; - you might take a fancy to see how we fight, and you
might receive some chance shot.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Our Scotsmen are very bad marksmen,
and I do not wish that a worthy gentleman like you should return
to France wounded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Nor
should I like to be obliged, myself, to send to your prince his
million left here by you; for then it would be said, and with
some reason, that I paid the Pretender to enable him to make war
against the parliament.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Go, then, monsieur, and let it be done as has been agreed
upon."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah, my lord," said
Athos, "what joy it would give me to be the first that penetrated
to the noble heart which beats beneath that cloak!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You think, then, that I
have secrets," said Monk, without changing the half cheerful
expression of his countenance.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Why, monsieur, what secret can you
expect to find in the hollow head of a soldier?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But it is getting late, and our
torch is almost out; let us call our man."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

French, approaching the stairs; "<i style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The fisherman, benumbed
by the cold night air, replied in a hoarse voice, asking what
they wanted of him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Go to the post," said
Monk, "and order a sergeant, in the name of General Monk, to come
here immediately."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This was a commission
easily performed; for the sergeant, uneasy at the general's being
in that desolate abbey, had drawn nearer by degrees, and was not
much further off than the fisherman.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The general's order was therefore
heard by him, and he hastened to obey it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Get a horse and two
men," said Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

repeated the sergeant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes," replied
Monk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Have you got any
means of getting a horse with a pack-saddle or two panniers?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No doubt, at a hundred
paces off, in the Scottish camp."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

the horse, general."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Look here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The sergeant descended
the three steps which separated him from Monk, and came into the
vault.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You see," said Monk,
"that gentleman yonder?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "They are two casks, one
containing powder, and the other balls; I wish these casks to be
transported to the little hamlet at the mouth of the river, and
which I intend to occupy to-morrow with two hundred muskets.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You understand that the
commission is a secret one, for it is a movement that may decide
the fate of the battle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, general!" murmured
the sergeant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Mind, then!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Let these casks be fastened on to
the horse, and let them be escorted by two men and you to the
residence of this gentleman, who is my friend.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But take care that nobody knows
it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I would go by the marsh
if I knew the road," said the sergeant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I know one myself,"
said Athos; "it is not wide, but it is solid, having been made
upon piles; and with care we shall get over safely enough."</p>

'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do everything this
gentleman shall order you to do."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! oh! the casks are
heavy," said the sergeant, trying to lift one.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "They weigh four hundred
pounds each, if they contain what they ought to contain, do they
not, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Thereabouts," said
Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The sergeant went in
search of the two men and the horse.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk, left alone with Athos,
affected to speak to him on nothing but indifferent subjects
while examining the vault in a cursory manner.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then, hearing the horse's steps,
-</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I leave you with your
men, monsieur," said he, "and return to the camp.<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I shall see you again,
then, my lord?" asked Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is agreed upon,
monsieur, and with much pleasure."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk held out his hand
to Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! my lord, if you
would!" murmured Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Hush! monsieur, it is
agreed that we shall speak no more of that."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And bowing to Athos, he went up the
stairs, meeting about half-way his men, who were coming
down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had not gone
twenty paces, when a faint but prolonged whistle was heard at a
distance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk listened,
but seeing nothing and hearing nothing, he continued his
route.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then he remembered
the fisherman, and looked about for him; but the fisherman had
disappeared.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If he had,
however, looked with more attention, he might have seen that man,
bent double, gliding like a serpent along the stones and losing
himself in the mist that floated over the surface of the
marsh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He might equally
have seen, had he attempted to pierce that mist, a spectacle that
might have attracted his attention; and that was the rigging of
the vessel, which had changed place, and was now nearer the
shore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But Monk saw
nothing; and thinking he had nothing to fear, he entered the
deserted causeway which led to his camp.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was then that the disappearance
of the fisherman appeared strange, and that a real suspicion
began to take possession of his mind.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had just placed at the orders of
Athos the only post that could protect him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had a mile of causeway to
traverse before he could regain his camp.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The fog increased with such
intensity that he could scarcely distinguish objects at ten
paces' distance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk
then thought he heard the sound of an oar over the marsh on the
right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Who goes there?"
said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> But nobody answered;
then he cocked his pistol, took his sword in his hand, and
quickened his pace, without, however, being willing to call
anybody.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Such a summons,
for which there was no absolute necessity, appeared unworthy of
him.</p>

I</span>t was seven o'clock in the morning, the first rays of day
lightened the pools of the marsh, in which the sun was reflected
like a red ball, when Athos, awakening and opening the window of
his bed-chamber, which looked out upon the banks of the river,
perceived, at fifteen paces' distance from him, the sergeant and
the men who had accompanied him the evening before, and who,
after having deposited the casks at his house, had returned to
the camp by the causeway on the right.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Why had these men come
back after having returned to the camp?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That was the question which first
presented itself to Athos.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The sergeant, with his head raised,
appeared to be watching the moment when the gentleman should
appear to address him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Athos, surprised to see these men, whom he had seen depart the
night before, could not refrain from expressing his astonishment
to them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "There is nothing
surprising in that, monsieur," said the sergeant; "for yesterday
the general commanded me to watch over your safety, and I thought
it right to obey that order."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Is the general at the
camp?" asked Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No doubt he is,
monsieur; as when he left you he was going back."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, wait for me a
moment; I am going thither to render an account of the fidelity
with which you fulfilled your duty, and to get my sword, which I
left upon the table in the tent."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "This happens very
well," said the sergeant, "for we were about to request you to do
so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Athos fancied he could
detect an air of equivocal <i style=

the sergeant; but the adventure of the vault might have excited
the curiosity of the man, and it was not surprising that he
allowed some of the feelings which agitated his mind to appear in
his face.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos closed
the doors carefully, confiding the keys to Grimaud, who had
chosen his domicile beneath the shed itself, which led to the
cellar where the casks had been deposited.<span style=

la F&egrave;re to the camp.<span style=

relieved the four men who had conducted Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This fresh guard was
commanded by the aid-de-camp Digby, who, on their way, fixed upon
Athos looks so little encouraging, that the Frenchman asked
himself whence arose, with regard to him, this vigilance and this
severity, when the evening before he had been left perfectly
free.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He nevertheless
continued his way to the headquarters, keeping to himself the
observations which men and things forced him to make.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He found in the general's tent, to
which he had been introduced the evening before, three superior
officers: these were Monk's lieutenant and two colonels.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos perceived his sword; it
was still on the table where he left it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Neither of the officers had seen
Athos, consequently neither of them knew him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk's lieutenant asked, at the
appearance of Athos, if that were the same gentleman with whom
the general had left the tent.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, your honor," said
the sergeant; "it is the same."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But," said Athos,
haughtily, "I do not deny it, I think; and now, gentlemen, in
turn, permit me to ask you to what purpose these questions are
asked, and particularly some explanations upon the tone in which
you ask them?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur," said the
lieutenant, "if we address these questions to you, it is because
we have a right to do so, and if we make them in a particular
tone, it is because that tone, believe me, agrees with the
circumstances."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Gentlemen," said Athos,
"you do not know who I am; but I must tell you that I acknowledge
no one here but General Monk as my equal.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Where is he?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Let me be conducted to him, and if
he has any questions to put to me, I will answer him and to his
satisfaction, I hope.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I
repeat, gentlemen, where is the general?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Eh! good God! you know
better than we do where he is," said the lieutenant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur," said Athos;
"I do not understand you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You will understand me
- and, in the first place, do not speak so loudly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Athos smiled
disdainfully.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "We don't ask you to
smile," said one of the colonels warmly; "we require you to
answer."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And I, gentlemen,
declare to you that I will not reply until I am in the presence
of the general."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But," replied the same
colonel who had already spoken, "you know very well that is
impossible."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "This is the second time
I have received this strange reply to the wish I express," said
Athos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Is the general
absent?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This question was made
with such apparent good faith, and the gentleman wore an air of
such natural surprise, that the three officers exchanged a
meaning look.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
lieutenant, by a tacit convention with the other two, was
spokesman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur, the general
left you last night on the borders of the monastery."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And you went - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is not for me to
answer you, but for those who have accompanied me.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They were your soldiers, ask
them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But if we please to
question you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Then it will please me
to reply, monsieur, that I do not recognize any one here, that I
know no one here but the general, and that it is to him alone I
will reply."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "So be it, monsieur; but
as we are the masters, we constitute ourselves a council of war,
and when you are before judges you must reply."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The countenance of Athos
expressed nothing but astonishment and disdain, instead of the
terror the officers expected to read in it at this threat.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Scottish or English
judges upon me, a subject of the king of France; upon me, placed
under the safeguard of British honor!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You are mad, gentlemen!" said Athos,
shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The officers looked at
each other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Then,
monsieur," said one of them, "do you pretend not to know where
the general is?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To that, monsieur, I
have already replied."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, but you have
already replied an incredible thing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is true,
nevertheless, gentlemen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Men of my rank are not generally liars.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am a gentleman, I have told you,
and when I have at my side the sword which, by an excess of
delicacy, I left last night upon the table whereon it still lies,
believe me, no man says that to me which I am unwilling to
hear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am at this moment
disarmed; if you pretend to be my judges, try me; if you are but
my executioners, kill me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But, monsieur - " asked
the lieutenant, in a more courteous voice, struck with the lofty
coolness of Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sir, I came to speak
confidentially with your general about affairs of
importance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was not an
ordinary welcome that he gave me.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The accounts your soldiers can give
you may convince you of that.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If, then, the general received me in
that manner, he knew my titles to his esteem.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now, you do not suspect, I should
think, that I should reveal my secrets to you, and still less
his."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But these casks, what
do they contain?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Have you not put that
question to your soldiers?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What was their reply?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That they contained
powder and ball."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "From whom had they that
information?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They must
have told you that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "From the general; but
we are not dupes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Beware, gentlemen; it
is not to me you are now giving the lie, it is to your
leader."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The officers again
looked at each other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Athos continued: "Before your soldiers the general told me to
wait a week, and at the expiration of that week he would give me
the answer he had to make me.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Have I fled away?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No; I wait."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He told you to wait a
week!" cried the lieutenant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He told me that so
clearly, sir, that I have a sloop at the mouth of the river,
which I could with ease have joined yesterday, and embarked.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now, if I have remained, it
was only in compliance with the desire of your general; his honor
having requested me not to depart without a last audience, which
he fixed at a week hence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
I repeat to you, then, I am waiting."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The lieutenant turned
towards the other officers, and said, in a low voice: "If this
gentleman speaks truth, there may still be some hope.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The general may be carrying out some
negotiations so secret, that he thought it imprudent to inform
even us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then the time
limited for his absence would be a week."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then, turning towards Athos:
"Monsieur," said he, "your declaration is of the most serious
importance; are you willing to repeat it under the seal of an
oath?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sir," replied Athos, "I
have always lived in a world where my simple word was regarded as
the most sacred of oaths."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "This time, however,
monsieur, the circumstance is more grave than any you may have
been placed in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
safety of the whole army is at stake.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Reflect; the general has
disappeared, and our search for him has been in vain.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Is this disappearance natural?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Has a crime been
committed?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Are we not
bound to carry our investigations to extremity?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Have we any right to wait with
patience?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At this moment,
everything, monsieur, depends upon the words you are about to
pronounce."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Thus questioned,
gentlemen, I no longer hesitate," said Athos.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Yes, I came hither to converse
confidentially with General Monk, and ask him for an answer
regarding certain interests; yes, the general being, doubtless,
unable to pronounce before the expected battle, begged me to
remain a week in the house I inhabit, promising me that in a week
I should see him again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Yes, all this is true, and I swear it by God who is the absolute
master of my life and yours."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos pronounced these words with so
much grandeur and solemnity, that the three officers were almost
convinced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Nevertheless,
one of the colonels made a last attempt.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur," said he,
"although we may now be persuaded of the truth of what you say,
there is yet a strange mystery in all this.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The general is too prudent a man to
have thus abandoned his army on the eve of a battle without
having at least given notice of it to one of us.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As for myself, I cannot believe but
some strange event has been the cause of this disappearance.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Yesterday some foreign
fishermen came to sell their fish here; they were lodged yonder
among the Scots; that is to say, on the road the general took
with this gentleman, to go to the abbey, and to return from
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was one of these
fishermen that accompanied the general with a light.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And this morning, bark and fishermen
have all disappeared, carried away by the night's tide."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "For my part," said the
lieutenant, "I see nothing in that that is not quite natural, for
these people were not prisoners."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No; but I repeat it was
one of them who lighted the general and this gentleman to the
abbey, and Digby assures us that the general had strong
suspicions concerning those people.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now, who can say whether these
people were not connected with this gentleman; and that, the blow
being struck, the gentleman, who is evidently brave, did not
remain to reassure us by his presence, and to prevent our
researches being made in a right direction?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This speech made an
impression upon the other two officers.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sir," said Athos,
"permit me to tell you, that your reasoning, though specious in
appearance, nevertheless wants consistency, as regards me. <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have remained, you say, to
divert suspicion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well!
on the contrary, suspicions arise in me as well as in you; and I
say, it is impossible, gentlemen, that the general, on the eve of
a battle, should leave his army without saying anything to at
least one of his officers.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Yes, there is some strange event
connected with this; instead of being idle and waiting, you must
display all the activity and all the vigilance possible.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am your prisoner, gentlemen,
upon parole or otherwise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
My honor is concerned in ascertaining what has become of General
Monk, and to such a point, that if you were to say to me,
'Depart!'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I should reply:
'No, I will remain!'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And
if you were to ask my opinion, I should add:<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> 'Yes, the general is the victim of
some conspiracy, for, if he had intended to leave the camp he
would have told me so.'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Seek, then, search the land, search the sea; the general has not
gone of his own good will."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The lieutenant made a
sign to the two other officers.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, monsieur," said he,
"no; in your turn you go too far.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The general has nothing to suffer
from these events, and, no doubt, has directed them.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What Monk is now doing he has often
done before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We are wrong
in alarming ourselves; his absence will, doubtless, be of short
duration; therefore, let us beware, lest by a pusillanimity which
the general would consider a crime, of making his absence public,
and by that means demoralize the army.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The general gives a striking proof
of his confidence in us; let us show ourselves worthy of it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Gentlemen, let the most
profound silence cover all this with an impenetrable veil; we
will detain this gentleman, not from mistrust of him with regard
to the crime, but to assure more effectively the secret of the
general's absence by keeping among ourselves; therefore, until
fresh orders, the gentleman will remain at headquarters."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Gentlemen," said Athos,
"you forget that last night the general confided to me a deposit
over which I am bound to watch.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Give me whatever guard you like,
chain me if you like, but leave me the house I inhabit for my
prison.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The general, on
his return, would reproach you, I swear on the honor of a
gentleman, for having displeased him in this."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "So be it, monsieur,"
said the lieutenant; "return to your abode."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Then they placed over
Athos a guard of fifty men, who surrounded his house, without
losing sight of him for a minute.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The secret remained
secure, but hours, days passed away without the general's
returning, or without anything being heard of him.</p>

T</span>wo days after the events we have just related, and while
General Monk was expected every minute in the camp to which he
did not return, a little Dutch <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>felucca</i>, manned by eleven men,
cast anchor upon the coast of Scheveningen, nearly within
cannon-shot of the port.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
It was night, the darkness was great, the tide rose in the
darkness; it was a capital time to land passengers and
merchandise.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The road of Scheveningen
forms a vast crescent; it is not very deep and not very safe;
therefore, nothing is seen stationed there but large Flemish
hoys, or some of those Dutch barks which fishermen draw up on the
sand on rollers, as the ancients did, according to Virgil.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When the tide is rising, and
advancing on land, it is not prudent to bring the vessels too
close in shore, for, if the wind is fresh, the prows are buried
in the sand; and the sand of that coast is spongy; it receives
easily, but does not yield so well.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was on this account, no doubt,
that a boat was detached from the bark, as soon as the latter had
cast anchor, and came with eight sailors, amidst whom was to be
seen an object of an oblong form, a sort of large pannier or
bale.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The shore was deserted;
the few fishermen inhabiting the down were gone to bed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The only sentinel that guarded
the coast (a coast very badly guarded, seeing that a landing from
large ships was impossible), without having been able to follow
the example of the fishermen, who were gone to bed, imitated them
so far, that he slept at the back of his watch-box as soundly as
they slept in their beds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The only noise to be heard, then, was the whistling of the night
breeze among the bushes and the brambles of the downs.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But the people who were
approaching were doubtless mistrustful people, for this real
silence and apparent solitude did not satisfy them.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Their boat, therefore, scarcely as
visible as a dark speck upon the ocean, gilded along noiselessly,
avoiding the use of their oars for fear of being heard, and
gained the nearest land.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Scarcely had it touched
the ground when a single man jumped out of the boat, after having
given a brief order, in a manner which denoted the habit of
commanding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In
consequence of this order, several muskets immediately glittered
in the feeble light reflected from that mirror of the heavens,
the sea; and the oblong bale of which we spoke, containing no
doubt some contraband object, was transported to land, with
infinite precautions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Immediately after that, the man who had landed first, set off at
a rapid pace diagonally towards the village of Scheveningen,
directing his course to the nearest point of the wood.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When there, he sought for that
house already described as the temporary residence - and a very
humble residence - of him who was styled by courtesy king of
England.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> All were asleep there,
as everywhere else, only a large dog, of the race of those which
the fishermen of Scheveningen harness to little carts to carry
fish to the Hague, began to bark formidably as soon as the
stranger's steps were audible beneath the windows.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But the watchfulness, instead of
alarming the newly-landed man, appeared, on the contrary, to give
him great joy, for his voice might perhaps have proved
insufficient to rouse the people of the house, whilst, with an
auxiliary of that sort, his voice became almost useless.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The stranger waited, then,
till these reiterated and sonorous barkings should, according to
all probability, have produced their effect, and then he ventured
a summons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On hearing his
voice, the dog began to roar with such violence that another
voice was soon heard from the interior, quieting the dog.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> With that the dog was
quieted.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What do you want?"
asked that voice, at the same time weak, broken, and civil.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I want his majesty King
Charles II., king of England," said the stranger.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What do you want with
him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

presently, sire," said D'Artagnan.<span style=

returning to England and regaining your throne for want of men
and money."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

movement of impatience to escape him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And the principal
object your majesty found in your way," continued D'Artagnan,
"was a certain general commanding the armies of the parliament,
and who was playing yonder the part of another Cromwell.<span

so?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

that it is very fortunate that they fell into those of his
lieutenant of musketeers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>

pardon my want of etiquette.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Your majesty added that,
notwithstanding, if you could see him, confer with him, and meet
him face to face, you would triumph, either by force or
persuasion, over that obstacle - the only serious one, the only
insurmountable one, the only real one you met with on your
road."</p>

'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "One thing alone, that
if this General Monk is troublesome to the point your majesty
describes, it would be expedient to get rid of him or make an
ally of him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur, a king who
has neither army nor money, as you have heard my conversation

Monk."</p>

D'Artagnan, simply.</p>

cried the king, almost indignant at what he considered a

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

D'Artagnan, in the same tone, "I bring him to you; he is down

him to breathe."</p>

T</span>he king could not overcome his surprise, and looked
sometimes at the smiling face of the musketeer, and sometimes at
the dark window which opened into the night.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But before he had fixed his ideas,
eight of D'Artagnan's men, for two had remained to take care of
the bark, brought to the house, where Parry received him, that
object of an oblong form, which, for the moment, inclosed the
destinies of England.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Before he left Calais, D'Artagnan had had made in that city a
sort of coffin, large and deep enough for a man to turn in it at
his ease.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The bottom and
sides, properly upholstered, formed a bed sufficiently soft to
prevent the rolling of the ship turning this kind of cage into a
rat-trap.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The little
grating, of which D'Artagnan had spoken to the king, like the
visor of the helmet, was placed opposite to the man's face.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was so constructed that, at
the least cry, a sudden pressure would stifle that cry, and, if
necessary, him who had uttered that cry.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan was so well
acquainted with his crew and his prisoner, that during the whole
voyage he had been in dread of two things: either that the
general would prefer death to this sort of imprisonment, and
would smother himself by endeavoring to speak, or that his guards
would allow themselves to be tempted by the offers of the
prisoner, and put him, D'Artagnan, into the box instead of
Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan, therefore,
had passed the two days and the two nights of the voyage close to
the coffin, alone with the general, offering him wine and food,
which the latter had refused, and constantly endeavoring to
reassure him upon the destiny which awaited him at the end of
this singular captivity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Two pistols on the table and his naked sword made D'Artagnan easy
with regard to indiscretions from without.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> When once at
Scheveningen he had felt completely reassured.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His men greatly dreaded any conflict
with the lords of the soil.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had, besides, interested in his
cause him who had morally served him as lieutenant, and whom we
have seen reply to the name of Menneville.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The latter, not being a vulgar
spirit, had more to risk than the others, because he had more
conscience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He believed
in a future in the service of D'Artagnan, and consequently would
have allowed himself to be cut to pieces, rather than violate the
order given by his leader.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Thus it was that, once landed, it
was to him that D'Artagnan had confided the care of the chest and
the general's breathing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
It was he, too, he had ordered to have the chest brought by the
seven men as soon as he should hear the triple whistle.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We have seen that the
lieutenant obeyed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
coffer once in the house, D'Artagnan dismissed his men with a
gracious smile, saying, "Messieurs, you have rendered a great
service to King Charles II., who in less than six weeks will be
king of England.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Your
gratification will then be doubled.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Return to the boat and wait for
me."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Upon which they
departed with such shouts of joy as terrified even the dog
himself.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan had caused
the coffer to be brought as far as the king's ante-chamber.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He then, with great care,
closed the door of this ante-chamber, after which he opened the
coffer, and said to the general:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "General, I have a
thousand excuses to make to you; my manner of acting has not been
worthy of such a man as you, I know very well; but I wished you
to take me for the captain of a bark.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And then England is a very
inconvenient country for transports.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I hope, therefore, you will take all
that into consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
But now, general, you are at liberty to get up and walk."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This said, he cut the bonds
which fastened the arms and hands of the general.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The latter got up, and then sat down
with the countenance of a man who expects death.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan opened the door of
Charles's study, and said, "Sire, here is your enemy, M. Monk; I
promised myself to perform this service for your majesty.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is done; now order as you
please.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M. Monk," added
he, turning towards the prisoner, "you are in the presence of his
majesty Charles II., sovereign lord of Great Britain."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk raised towards the
prince his coldly stoical look, and replied: "I know no king of
Great Britain; I recognize even here no one worthy of bearing the
name of gentleman: for it is in the name of King Charles II. that
an emissary, whom I took for an honest man, came and laid an
infamous snare for me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I
have fallen into that snare; so much the worse for me.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now, you the tempter," said he
to the king; "you the executor," said he to D'Artagnan; "remember
what I am about to say to you: you have my body, you may kill it,
and I advise you to do so, for you shall never have my mind or my
will.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And now, ask me not
a single word, as from this moment I will not open my mouth even
to cry out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have
said."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And he pronounced these
words with the savage, invincible resolution of the most
mortified Puritan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan looked at his prisoner like a man who knows the value
of every word, and who fixes that value according to the accent
with which it has been pronounced.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The fact is," said he,
in a whisper to the king, "the general is an obstinate man; he
would not take a mouthful of bread, nor swallow a drop of wine,
during the two days of our voyage.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But as from this moment it is your
majesty who must decide his fate, I wash my hands of him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk, erect, pale, and
resigned, waited with his eyes fixed and his arms folded.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan turned towards
him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "You will please to
understand perfectly," said he, "that your speech, otherwise very
fine, does not suit anybody, not even yourself.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His majesty wished to speak to you,
you refused an interview; why, now that you are face to face,
that you are here by a force independent of your will, why do you
confine yourself to the rigors which I consider useless and
absurd?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Speak! what the
devil! speak, if only to say 'No.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk did not unclose his
lips; Monk did not turn his eyes; Monk stroked his mustache with
a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> thoughtful air, which
announced that matters were going on badly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> During all this time
Charles II. had fallen into a profound reverie.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> For the first time he found himself
face to face with Monk; with the man he had so much desired to
see; and, with that peculiar glance which God has given to eagles
and kings, he had fathomed the abyss of his heart.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He beheld Monk, then, resolved
positively to die rather than speak, which was not to be wondered
at in so considerable a man, the wound in whose mind must at the
moment have been cruel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Charles II. formed, on the instant, one of those resolutions upon
which an ordinary man risks his life, a general his fortune, and
a king his kingdom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Monsieur," said he to Monk, "you are perfectly right upon
certain points; I do not, therefore, ask you to answer me, but to
listen to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> There was a moment's
silence, during which the king looked at Monk, who remained
impassible.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You have made me just
now a painful reproach, monsieur," continued the king; "you said
that one of my emissaries had been to Newcastle to lay a snare
for you, and that, parenthetically, cannot be understood by M.
d'Artagnan here, and to whom, before everything, I owe sincere
thanks for his generous, his heroic devotion."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan bowed with
respect; Monk took no notice.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "For M. d'Artagnan - and
observe, M. Monk, I do not say this to excuse myself - for M.
d'Artagnan," continued the king, "went to England of his free
will, without interest, without orders, without hope, like a true
gentleman as he is, to render a service to an unfortunate king,
and to add to the illustrious actions of an existence, already so
well filled, one glorious deed more."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan colored a
little, and coughed to keep his countenance.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk did not stir.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You do not believe what
I tell you, M. Monk," continued the king.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I can understand that, - such
proofs of devotion are so rare, that their reality may well be
put in doubt."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur would do wrong
not to believe you, sire," cried D'Artagnan: "for that which your
majesty has said is the exact truth, and the truth so exact that
it seems, in going to fetch the general, I have done something
which sets everything wrong.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In truth, if it be so, I am in
despair."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur d'Artagnan,"
said the king, pressing the hand of the musketeer, "you have
obliged me as much as if you had promoted the success of my
cause, for you have revealed to me an unknown friend, to whom I
shall ever be grateful, and whom I shall always love."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And the king pressed his hand
cordially.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "And,"
continued he, bowing to Monk, "an enemy whom I shall henceforth
esteem at his proper value."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The eyes of the Puritan
flashed, but only once, and his countenance, for an instant,
illuminated by that flash, resumed its somber impassibility.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Then, Monsieur
d'Artagnan," continued Charles, "this is what was about to
happen: M. le Comte de la F&egrave;re, who you know, I believe,
has set out for Newcastle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What, Athos!" exclaimed
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, that was his <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>nom de guerre</i>, I
believe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The Comte de la
F&egrave;re had then set out for Newcastle, and was going,
perhaps, to bring the general to hold a conference with me or
with those of my party, when you violently, as it appears,
interfered with the negotiation."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mordioux!</i>" replied D'Artagnan,
"he entered the camp the very evening in which I succeeded in
getting into it with my fishermen - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> An almost imperceptible
frown on the brow of Monk told D'Artagnan that he had surmised
rightly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, yes," muttered he;
"I thought I knew his person; I even fancied I knew his
voice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Unlucky wretch
that I am!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh! sire,
pardon me!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I thought I
had so successfully steered my bark."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "There is nothing ill in
it, sir," said the king, "except that the general accuses me of
having laid a snare for him, which is not the case.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No, general, those are not the arms
which I contemplated employing with you, as you will soon
see.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the meanwhile,
when I give you my word upon the honor of a gentleman, believe
me, sir, believe me!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now,
Monsieur d'Artagnan, a word with you, if you please."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I listen on my knees,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are truly at my
service, are you not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your majesty has seen
that I am, too much so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is well; from a
man like you one word suffices.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In addition to that word you bring
actions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> General, have
the goodness to follow me.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Come with us, M. d'Artagnan"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan, considerably
surprised, prepared to obey.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Charles II. went out, Monk followed
him, D'Artagnan followed Monk.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Charles took the path by which
D'Artagnan had come to his abode; the fresh sea breezes soon
caressed the faces of the three nocturnal travelers, and, at
fifty paces from the little gate which Charles opened, they found
themselves upon the down in the face of the ocean, which, having
ceased to rise, reposed upon the shore like a wearied
monster.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Charles II.
walked pensively along, his head hanging down and his hand
beneath his cloak.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk
followed him, with crossed arms and an uneasy look.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan came last, with his hand
on the hilt of his sword.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Where is the boat in
which you came, gentlemen?" said Charles to the musketeer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yonder, sire; I have
seven men and an officer waiting me in that little bark which is
lighted by a fire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, I see; the boat is
drawn upon the sand; but you certainly did not come from
Newcastle in that frail bark?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> No, sire; I freighted a
felucca, at my own expense, which is at anchor within cannon-shot
of the downs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was in
that felucca we made the voyage."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sir," said the king to
Monk, "you are free."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> However firm his will,
Monk could not suppress an exclamation.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king added an affirmative motion
of his head, and continued: "We shall waken a fisherman of the
village, who will put his boat to sea immediately, and will take
you back to any place you may command him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M. d'Artagnan here will escort your
honor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I place M.
d'Artagnan under the safeguard of your loyalty, M. Monk."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk allowed a murmur of
surprise to escape him, and D'Artagnan a profound sigh.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king, without appearing to
notice either, knocked against the deal trellis which inclosed
the cabin of the principal fisherman inhabiting the down.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Hey!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Keyser!" cried he, "awake!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Who calls me?" asked
the fisherman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I, Charles the
king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah, my lord!" cried
Keyser, rising ready dressed from the sail in which he slept, as
people sleep in a hammock.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "What can I do to serve you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Captain Keyser," said
Charles, "you must set sail immediately.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Here is a traveler who wishes to
freight your bark, and will pay you well; serve him well."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And the king drew back a few
steps to allow Monk to speak to the fisherman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I wish to cross over
into England," said Monk, who spoke Dutch enough to make himself
understood.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "This minute," said the
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>patron</i>, "this very
minute, if you wish it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But will that be long?"
said Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Not half an hour, your
honor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> My eldest son is
at this moment preparing the boat, as we were going out fishing
at three o'clock in the morning."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, is all arranged?"
asked the king, drawing near.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "All but the price,"
said the fisherman; "yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is my affair,"
said Charles, "the gentleman is my friend."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk started and looked
at Charles on hearing this word.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very well, my lord,"
replied Keyser.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And at
that moment they heard Keyser's son, signaling form the shore
with the blast of a bull's horn.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Now, gentlemen," said
the king, "depart."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire," said D'Artagnan,
"will it please your majesty to grant me a few minutes?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have engaged men, and I am
going without them; I must give them notice."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Whistle to them," said
Charles, smiling.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan, accordingly,
whistled, whilst the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>patron</i> Keyser replied to his
son; and four men, led by Menneville, attended the first
summons.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Here is some money in
account," said D'Artagnan, putting into their hands a purse
containing two thousand five hundred livres in gold.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Go and wait for me at Calais, you
know where."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And
D'Artagnan heaved a profound sigh, as he let the purse fall into
the hands of Menneville.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What, are you leaving
us?" cried the men.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "For a short time," said
D'Artagnan, "or for a long time, who knows?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But with 2,500 livres, and the 2,500
you have already received, you are paid according to our
agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We are quits,
then, my friend."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But the boat?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do not trouble yourself
about that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Our things are on board
the felucca."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Go and seek them, and
then set off immediately."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, captain."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan returned to
Monk, saying, - "Monsieur, I await your orders, for I understand
we are to go together, unless my company be disagreeable to
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "On the contrary,
monsieur," said Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Come, gentlemen, on
board," cried Keyser's son.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Charles bowed to the
general with grace and dignity, saying, - "You will pardon me
this unfortunate accident, and the violence to which you have
been subjected, when you are convinced that I was not the cause
of them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk bowed profoundly
without replying.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On his
side, Charles affected not to say a word to D'Artagnan in
private, but aloud, - "Once more, thanks, monsieur le chevalier,"
said he, "thanks for your services.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They will be repaid you by the Lord
God, who, I hope, reserves trials and troubles for me alone."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk followed Keyser and
his son embarked with them.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan came after, muttering to
himself, - "Poor Planchet! poor Planchet!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am very much afraid we have made a
bad speculation."</p>

D</span>uring the passage, Monk only spoke to D'Artagnan in cases
of urgent necessity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Thus, when the Frenchman hesitated to come and take his meals,
poor meals, composed of salt fish, biscuit, and Hollands gin,
Monk called him, saying, - "To table, monsieur, to table!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This was all.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan, from being himself
on all great occasions, extremely concise, did not draw from the
general's conciseness a favorable augury of the result of his
mission.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now, as
D'Artagnan had plenty of time for reflection, he battered his
brains during this time in endeavoring to find out how Athos had
seen King Charles, how he had conspired his departure with him,
and lastly, how he had entered Monk's camp; and the poor
lieutenant of musketeers plucked a hair from his mustache every
time that he reflected that the horseman who accompanied Monk on
the night of the famous abduction must have been Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> At length, after a
passage of two nights and two days, the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>patron</i> Keyser touched at the
point where Monk, who had given all the orders during the voyage,
had commanded they should land.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was exactly at the mouth of the
little river, near where Athos had chosen his abode.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Daylight was waning, a
splendid sun, like a red steel buckler, was plunging the lower
extremity of its disc beneath the blue line of the sea.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The felucca was making fair
way up the river, tolerably wide in that part, but Monk, in his
impatience, desired to be landed, and Keyser's boat set him and
D'Artagnan upon the muddy bank, amidst the reeds.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan, resigned to obedience,
followed Monk exactly as a chained bear follows his master; but
the position humiliated him not a little, and he grumbled to
himself that the service of kings was a bitter one, and that the
best of them was good for nothing.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk walked with long and hasty
strides; it might be thought that he did not yet feel certain of
having reached English land.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They had already begun to perceive
distinctly a few of the cottages of the sailors and fishermen
spread over the little quay of this humble port, when, all at
once, D'Artagnan cried out, - "God pardon me, there is a house on
fire!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk raised his eyes,
and perceived there was, in fact, a house which the flames were
beginning to devour.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It
had begun at a little shed belonging to the house, the roof of
which had caught.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
fresh evening breeze agitated the fire.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The two travelers quickened their
steps, hearing loud cries, and seeing, as they drew nearer,
soldiers with their glittering arms pointed towards the house on
fire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was doubtless
this menacing occupation which had made them neglect to signal
the felucca.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk stopped
short for an instant, and, for the first time, formulated his
thoughts into words.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Eh!
but," said he, "perhaps they are not my soldiers but
Lambert's."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> These words contained at
once a sorrow, and apprehension, and a reproach perfectly
intelligible to D'Artagnan.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In fact, during the general's
absence, Lambert might have given battle, conquered, and
dispersed the parliament's army, and taken with his own the place
of Monk's army, deprived of its strongest support.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At this doubt, which passed from the
mind of Monk to his own, D'Artagnan reasoned in this manner: -
"One of two things is going to happen; either Monk has spoken
correctly, and there are no longer any but Lambertists in the
country - that is to say, enemies, who would receive me
wonderfully well, since it is to me they owe their victory; or
nothing is changed, and Monk, transported with joy at finding his
camp still in the same place, will not prove too severe in his
settlement with me."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Whilst thinking thus, the two travelers advanced, and began to
mingle with a little knot of sailors, who looked on with sorrow
at the burning house, but did not dare to say anything on account
of the threats of the soldiers.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk addressed one of these sailors:
- "What is going on here?" asked he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sir," replied<span

as an officer, under the thick cloak which enveloped him, "that
house was inhabited by a foreign gentleman, and this foreigner
became suspected by the soldiers.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They wanted to get into his house
under pretense of taking him to the camp; but he, without being
frightened by their number, threatened death to the first who
should cross the threshold of his door; and as there was one who
did venture, the Frenchman stretched him on the earth with a
pistol-shot."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! he is a Frenchman,
is he?" said D'Artagnan, rubbing his hands.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Good!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "How good?" replied the
fisherman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, I don't mean that.
- What then - my tongue slipped."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What then, sir? - why,
the other men became as enraged as so many lions: they fired more
than a hundred shots at the house; but the Frenchman was
sheltered by the wall, and every time they tried to enter by the
door they met with a shot from his lackey, whose aim is deadly,
d'ye see?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Every time they
threatened the window, they met with a pistol-shot from the
master.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Look and count -
there are seven men down."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! my brave
countryman," cried D'Artagnan, "wait a little, wait a
little.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I will be with
you; and we will settle with this rabble."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "One instant, sir," said
Monk, "wait."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No; only the time to
ask a question."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then,
turning towards the sailor, "My friend," asked he, with an
emotion which, in spite of all his self-command, he could not
conceal, "whose soldiers are these, pray tell me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Whose should they be

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

what purpose?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Lambert's
army is melting away like snow in April.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> All come to Monk, officers and

Lambert won't have fifty men left."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The fisherman was
interrupted by a fresh discharge directed against the house, and
by another pistol-shot which replied to the discharge and struck
down the most daring of the aggressors.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The rage of soldiers was at its
height.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The fire still
continued to increase, and a crest of flame and smoke whirled and
spread over the roof of the house.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan could no longer contain
himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mordioux!</i>" said he to Monk,
glancing at him sideways: "you are a general, and allow your men
to burn houses and assassinate people, while you look on and warm
your hands at the blaze of the conflagration?<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

forward.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Remain where you are,
sir," said Monk, in a tone of command.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he advanced towards the house,
just as an officer had approached it, saying to the besieged:
"The house is burning, you will be roasted within an hour!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There is still time - come,
tell us what you know of General Monk, and we will spare your
life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Reply, or by Saint

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The besieged made no

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

expected," continued the officer; "in a quarter of an hour there
will be a hundred men around your house."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I reply to you," said
the Frenchman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Let your

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

D'Artagnan; "why, that's the voice of Athos!<span style=

D'Artagnan flashed from its sheath.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk stopped him and advanced
himself, exclaiming, in a sonorous voice: "<i style=

here?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Digby, whence this
fire? why these cries?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The general!" cried
Digby, letting the point of his sword fall.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The general!" repeated
the soldiers.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, what is there so
astonishing in that?" said Monk, in a calm tone.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then, silence being re-established,
- "Now," said he, "who lit this fire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The soldiers hung their
heads.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What! do I ask a
question, and nobody answers me?" said Monk.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "What! do I find a fault, and nobody
repairs it?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The fire is
still burning, I believe."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Immediately the twenty
men rushed forward, seizing pails, buckets, jars, barrels, and
extinguishing the fire with as much ardor as they had, an instant
before, employed in promoting it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But already, and before all the
rest, D'Artagnan had applied a ladder to the house, crying,
"Athos! it is I, D'Artagnan!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do not kill me, my dearest
friend!"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And in a moment
the count was clasped in his arms.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> In the meantime,
Grimaud, preserving his calmness, dismantled the fortification of
the ground-floor, and after having opened the door, stood, with
his arms folded, quietly on the sill.<span style=

D'Artagnan, he uttered an exclamation of surprise.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The fire being extinguished, the
soldiers presented themselves, Digby at their head.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "General," said he,
"excuse us; what we have done was for love of your honor, whom we

to be absent, according to my pleasure, without giving formal
notice?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do you, by
chance, take me for a citizen from the city?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Is a gentleman, my friend, my guest,
to be besieged, entrapped, and threatened with death, because he
is suspected?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What
signifies the word, suspected?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Curse me if I don't have every one
of you shot like dogs, that the brave gentleman has left
alive!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "General," said Digby,
piteously, "there were twenty-eight of us, and see, there are
eight on the ground."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I authorize M. le Comte

Monk, stretching out his hand to Athos.<span style=

style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mr. Digby, you will consider
yourself under arrest for a month."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "General - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is to teach you,
sir, not to act, another time, without orders."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I had those of the
lieutenant, general."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The lieutenant had no
such orders to give you, and he shall be placed under arrest,
instead of you, if he has really commanded you to burn this
gentleman."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He did not command
that, general; he commanded us to bring him to the camp; but the
count was not willing to follow us."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I was not willing that
they should enter and plunder my house," said Athos to Monk, with
a significant look.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And you were quite
right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To the camp, I
say."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The soldiers
departed with dejected looks.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Now we are alone," said Monk to
Athos, "have the goodness to tell me, monsieur, why you persisted
in remaining here, whilst you had your felucca - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I waited for you,
general," said Athos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Had not your honor appointed to meet me in a week?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> An eloquent look from
D'Artagnan made it clear to Monk that these two men, so brave and
so loyal, had not acted in concert for his abduction.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He knew already it could not be
so.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur," said he to
D'Artagnan, "you were perfectly right.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Have the kindness to allow me a
moment's conversation with M. le Comte de la F&egrave;re?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan took
advantage of this to go and ask Grimaud how he was.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk requested Athos to conduct him
to the chamber he lived in.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This chamber was still
full of smoke and rubbish.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> More than fifty balls had passed
through the windows and mutilated the walls.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They found a table, inkstand, and
materials for writing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Monk took up a pen, wrote a single line, signed it, folded the
paper, sealed the letter with the seal of his ring, and handed
over the missive to Athos, saying, "Monsieur, carry, if you
please, this letter to King Charles II., and set out immediately,
if nothing detains you here any longer."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And the casks?" said
Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The fisherman who
brought me hither will assist you in transporting them on
board.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Depart, if
possible, within an hour."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, general," said
Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur D'Artagnan!"
cried Monk, from the window.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan ran up precipitately.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Embrace your friend and
bid him adieu, sir; he is returning to Holland."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To Holland!" cried
D'Artagnan; "and I?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are at liberty to
follow him, monsieur; but I request you to remain," said
Monk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Will you refuse
me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, no, general; I am
at your orders."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan embraced
Athos, and only had time to bid him adieu.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk watched them both.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then he took upon himself the
preparations for the departure, the transportation of the casks
on board, and the embarking of Athos; then, taking D'Artagnan by
the arm, who was quite amazed and agitated, he led him towards
Newcastle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Whilst going
along, the general leaning on his arm, D'Artagnan could not help
murmuring to himself, - "Come, come, it seems to me that the
shares of the firm of Planchet and Company are rising."</p>

D</span>'Artagnan, although he flattered himself with better
success, had, nevertheless, not too well comprehended his
situation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was a
strange and grave subject for him to reflect upon - this voyage
of Athos into England; this league of the king with Athos, and
that extraordinary combination of his design with that of the
Comte de la F&egrave;re.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The best way was to let things follow their own train.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> An imprudence had been
committed, and, whilst having succeeded, as he had promised,
D'Artagnan found that he had gained no advantage by his
success.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Since everything
was lost, he could risk no more.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan followed Monk
through his camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
return of the general had produced a marvelous effect, for his
people had thought him lost.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But Monk, with his austere look and
icy demeanor, appeared to ask of his eager lieutenants and
delighted soldiers the cause of all this joy.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Therefore, to the lieutenants who
had come to meet him, and who expressed the uneasiness with which
they had learnt his departure, -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why is all this?" said
he; "am I obliged to give you an account of myself?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But your honor, the
sheep may well tremble without the shepherd."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Tremble!" replied Monk,
in his calm and powerful voice; "ah, monsieur, what a word!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Curse me, if my sheep have not
both teeth and claws; I renounce being their shepherd.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Ah, you tremble, gentlemen, do
you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, general, for
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! pray meddle with
your own concerns.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If I
have not the wit God gave to Oliver Cromwell, I have that which
He has sent to me: I am satisfied with it, however little it may
be."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The officer made no
reply; and Monk, having imposed silence on his people, all
remained persuaded that he had accomplished some important work
or made some important trial.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This was forming a very poor
conception of his patience and scrupulous genius.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk, if he had the good faith of
the Puritans, his allies, must have returned fervent thanks to
the patron saint who had taken him from the box of M.
d'Artagnan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Whilst these
things were going on, our musketeer could not help constantly
repeating, -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "God grant that M. Monk
may not have as much pride as I have; for I declare that if any
one had put me into a coffer with that grating over my mouth, and
carried me packed up, like a calf, across the seas, I should
cherish such a memory of my piteous looks in that coffer, and
such an ugly animosity against him who had inclosed me in it, I
should dread so greatly to see a sarcastic smile blooming upon
the face of the malicious wretch, or in his attitude any
grotesque imitation of my position in the box, that, <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mordioux!</i><span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I should plunge a good dagger into
his throat in compensation for the grating, and would nail him
down in a veritable bier, in remembrance of the false coffin in
which I had been left in to grow moldy for two days."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And D'Artagnan spoke
honestly when he spoke thus; for the skin of our Gascon was a
very thin one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk,
fortunately, entertained other ideas.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He never opened his mouth to his
timid conqueror concerning the past; but he admitted him very
near to his person in his labors, took him with him to several
reconnoiterings, in such a way as to obtain that which he
evidently warmly desired, - a rehabilitation in the mind of
D'Artagnan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The latter
conducted himself like a past-master in the art of flattery: he
admired all Monk's tactics, and the ordering of his camp; he
joked very pleasantly upon the circumvallations of Lambert's
camp, who had, he said, very uselessly given himself the trouble
to inclose a camp for twenty thousand men, whilst an acre of
ground would have been quite sufficient for the corporal and
fifty guards who would perhaps remain faithful to him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk, immediately after
his arrival, had accepted the proposition made by Lambert the
evening before, for an interview, and which Monk's lieutenants
had refused under the pretext that the general was
indisposed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This
interview was neither long nor interesting: Lambert demanded a
profession of faith from his rival.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The latter declared he had no other
opinion than that of the majority.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Lambert asked if it would not be
more expedient to terminate the quarrel by an alliance than by a
battle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk hereupon
demanded a week for consideration.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now, Lambert could not refuse this:
and Lambert, nevertheless, had come saying that he should devour
Monk's army.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Therefore,
at the end of the interview, which Lambert's party watched with
impatience, nothing was decided - neither treaty nor battle - the
rebel army, as M. d'Artagnan had foreseen, began to prefer the
good cause to the bad one, and the parliament, <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>rumpish</i> as it was, to the
pompous nothings of Lambert's designs.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> They remembered,
likewise, the good feasts of London - the profusion of ale and
sherry with which the citizens of London paid their friends the
soldiers; - they looked with terror at the black war bread, at
the troubled waters of the Tweed, - too salt for the glass, not
enough so for the pot; and they said to themselves, "Are not the
roast meats kept warm for Monk in London?"<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> From that time nothing was heard of
but desertion in Lambert's army.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The soldiers allowed themselves to
be drawn away by the force of principles, which are, like
discipline, the obligatory tie in everybody constituted for any
purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk defended
the parliament - Lambert attacked it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk had no more inclination to
support parliament than Lambert, but he had it inscribed on his
standards, so that all those of the contrary party were reduced
to write upon theirs, "Rebellion," which sounded ill to puritan
ears.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They flocked, then,
from Lambert to Monk, as sinners flock from Baal to God.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk made his
calculations; at a thousand desertions a day Lambert had men
enough to last twenty days; but there is in sinking things such a
growth of weight and swiftness, which combine with each other,
that a hundred left the first day, five hundred the second, a
thousand the third.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk
thought he had obtained his rate.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But from one thousand the deserters
increased to two thousand, then to four thousand, and, a week
after, Lambert, perceiving that he had no longer the possibility
of accepting battle, if it were offered to him, took the wise
resolution of decamping during the night, returning to London,
and being beforehand with Monk in constructing a power with the
wreck of the military party.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> But Monk, free and
without uneasiness, marched towards London as a conqueror,
augmenting his army with all the floating parties on the
way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He encamped at
Barnet, that is to say, within four leagues of the capital,
cherished by the parliament, which thought it beheld in him a
protector, and awaited by the people, who were anxious to see him
reveal himself, that they might judge him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan himself had not been able
to fathom his tactics; he observed - he admired.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk could not enter London with a
settled determination without bringing about civil war.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He temporized for a short
time.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Suddenly, when least
expected, Monk drove the military party out of London, and
installed himself in the city amidst the citizens, by order of
the parliament; then, at the moment when the citizens were crying
out against Monk - at the moment when the soldiers themselves
were accusing their leader - Monk, finding himself certain of a
majority, declared to the Rump Parliament that it must abdicate -
be dissolved - and yield its place to a government which would
not be a joke.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk
pronounced this declaration, supported by fifty thousand swords,
to which, that same evening, were united, with shouts of
delirious joy, the five thousand inhabitants of the good city of
London.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At length, at the
moment when the people, after their triumphs and festive repasts
in the open streets, were looking about for a master, it was
affirmed that a vessel had left the Hague, bearing King Charles
II. and his fortunes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Gentlemen," said Monk
to his officers, "I am going to meet the legitimate king.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He who loves me will follow
me."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A burst of
acclamations welcomed these words, which D'Artagnan did not hear
without the greatest delight.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "<i style=

"that is bold, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I have no secrets from
you now," replied Monk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"I wrote these words: 'Sire, I expect your majesty in six weeks

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

"I no longer say it is bold; I say it is well played; it is a
fine stroke!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

T</span>he king of England made his <i style=

great pomp, as he afterwards did in London.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had sent for his brothers; he had
brought over his mother and sister.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> England had been for so long a time
given up to herself - that is to say, to tyranny, mediocrity and
nonsense - that this return of Charles II., whom the English only
knew as the son of the man whose head they had cut off, was a
festival for three kingdoms.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Consequently, all the good wishes,
all the acclamations which accompanied his return, struck the
young king so forcibly that he stooped and whispered in the ear
of James of York, his younger brother, "In truth, James, it seems
to have been our own fault that we were so long absent from a
country where we are so much beloved!"<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The pageant was magnificent.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Beautiful weather favored the
solemnity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Charles had
regained all his youth, all his good humor; he appeared to be
transfigured; hearts seemed to smile on him like the sun.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Amongst this noisy crowd of
courtiers and worshipers, who did not appear to remember they had
conducted to the scaffold at Whitehall the father of the new
king, a man, in the garb of a lieutenant of musketeers, looked,
with a smile upon his thin, intellectual lips, sometimes at the
people vociferating their blessings, and sometimes at the prince,
who pretended emotion, and who bowed most particularly to the
women, whose <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bouquets</i>
fell beneath his horse's feet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What a fine trade is
that of king!" said this man, so completely absorbed in
contemplation that he stopped in the middle of the road, leaving
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cort&eacute;ge</i> to
file past.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Now, there
is, in good truth, a prince all bespangled over with gold and
diamonds, enamelled with flowers like a spring meadow; he is
about to plunge his empty hands into the immense coffer in which
his now faithful - but so lately unfaithful - subjects have
amassed one or two cartloads of ingots of gold.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They cast <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bouquets</i> enough upon him to
smother him; and yet, if he had presented himself to them two
months ago, they would have sent as many bullets and balls at him
as they now throw flowers.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Decidedly it is worth something to
be born in a certain sphere, with due respect to the lowly, who
pretend that it is of very little advantage to them to be born
lowly."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>cort&eacute;ge</i> continued to
file on, and, with the king, the acclamations began to die away
in the direction of the palace, which, however, did not prevent
our officer from being pushed about.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mordioux!</i>" continued the
reasoner, "these people tread upon my toes and look upon <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>me</i> as of very little
consequence, or rather of none at all, seeing that they are
Englishmen and I am a Frenchman.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If all these people were asked, -
'Who is M. d'Artagnan?' they would reply, '<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Nescio vos</i>.'<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But let any one say to them, 'There
is the king going by,' 'There is M. Monk going by,' they would
run away, shouting, - '<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Vive

'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Vive M. Monk!</i>' till their lungs
were exhausted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And yet,"
continued he, surveying, with that look sometimes so keen and
sometimes so proud, the diminishing crowd, - "and yet, reflect a
little, my good people, on what your king has done, on what M.
Monk has done, and then think what has been done by this poor
unknown, who is called M. d'Artagnan!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is true you do not know him,
since he is here unknown, and that prevents your thinking about
the matter!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But, bah!
what matters it!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> All that
does not prevent Charles II. from being a great king, although he
has been exiled twelve years, or M. Monk from being a great
captain, although he did make a voyage to Holland in a box.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well, then, since it is
admitted that one is a great king and the other a great captain,
- '<i style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>Hurrah for King Charles
II.! - Hurrah for General Monk!</i>'"<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And his voice mingled with the
voices of the hundreds of spectators, over which it sounded for a
moment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then, the better
to play the devoted man, he took off his hat and waved it in the
air.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Some one seized his
arm in the very height of his expansive loyalism.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> (In 1660 that was so termed which we
now call royalism.)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Athos!" cried
D'Artagnan, "you here!"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You here! - and being

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

not willing to do so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

willing?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Because I am neither
envoy nor ambassador, nor representative of the king of France;

of another king than the one God has given me for a master."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "<i style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

my friend; he was about to die."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What is the matter with
you?" said Athos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "One

you, my friend; you who have done at least as much for his
majesty as I have."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Have I not," replied
D'Artagnan, with his Gascon laugh, "have I not done much for his

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, yes, but the king

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

said the musketeer bitterly.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "By my faith!<span style=

a moment ago trying to forget it myself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

not forget it, I will answer for him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The king does not know

that advance me in any respect? for, to do you justice, you have
labored nobly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But I - I

made them succeed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Follow
my calculations closely; you might not have, by persuasions or
mildness, convinced General Monk, whilst I so roughly treated
this dear general, that I furnished your prince with an
opportunity of showing himself generous: this generosity was
inspired in him by the fact of my fortunate mistake, and Charles
is paid by the restoration which Monk has brought about."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

although I am neither dear to him nor a captain; - and much
appreciated by the king, who has already forgotten my name; - it
is not less true, I say, that I shall return to my beautiful
country, cursed by the soldiers I had raised with the hopes of
large pay, cursed by the brave Planchet, of who I have borrowed a
part of his fortune."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

yet nothing of all this is true, for Charles II., king of
England, Scotland, and Ireland, has been replaced upon the throne

be?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do you imagine, my
dear D'Artagnan, that it was on the king's account I acted as I
have done?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I did not know
the young man.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I defended
the father, who represented a principle - sacred in my eyes, and
I allowed myself to be drawn towards the son from sympathy for
this same principle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Besides, he was a worthy knight, a noble creature, that father;
do you remember him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes; that is true; he
was a brave, an excellent man, who led a sad life, but made a
fine end."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, my dear
D'Artagnan, understand this; to that king, to that man of heart,
to that friend of my thoughts, if I durst venture to say so, I
swore at the last hour to preserve faithfully the secret of a
deposit which was to be transmitted to his son, to assist him in
his hour of need.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This
young man came to me; he described his destitution; he was
ignorant that he was anything to me save a living memory of his
father.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have
accomplished towards Charles II. what I promised Charles I.; that
is all!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Of what
consequence is it to me, then, whether he be grateful or
not?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is to myself I
have rendered a service, by relieving myself of this
responsibility, and not to him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, I have always
said," replied D'Artagnan, with a sigh, "that disinterestedness
was the finest thing in the world."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, and you, my
friend," resumed Athos, "are you not in the same situation as
myself?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If I have
properly understood your words, you allowed yourself to be
affected by the misfortunes of this young man; that, on your
part, was much greater than it was upon mine, for I had a duty to
fulfill; whilst you were under no obligation to the son of the
martyr.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You had not, on
your part, to pay him the price of that precious drop of blood
which he let fall upon my brow, through the floor of the
scaffold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That which made
you act was heart alone - the noble and good heart which you
possess beneath your apparent skepticism and sarcastic irony; you
have engaged the fortune of a servitor, and your own, I suspect,
my benevolent miser! and your sacrifice is not acknowledged!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Of what consequence is
it?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You wish to repay
Planchet his money.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I can
comprehend that, my friend: for it is not becoming in a gentleman
to borrow from his inferior, without returning to him principal
and interest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well, I
will sell La F&egrave;re if necessary, and if not, some little
farm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You shall pay
Planchet, and there will be enough, believe me, of corn left in
my granaries for us two and Raoul.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In this way, my friend, you will be
under obligations to nobody but yourself; and, if I know you
well, it will not be a small satisfaction to your mind to be able
to say, 'I have made a king!'<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Am I right?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Athos!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos!" murmured D'Artagnan,
thoughtfully, "I have told you more than once that the day on
which you will preach I shall attend the sermon; the day on which
you will tell me there is a hell - <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mordioux!</i><span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I shall be afraid of the gridiron
and the pitch-forks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You
are better than I, or rather, better than anybody, and I only
acknowledge the possession of one quality, and that is, of not
being jealous.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Except
that defect, damme, as the English say, if I have not all the
rest."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I know no one equal to
D'Artagnan," replied Athos; "but here we are, having quietly
reached the house I inhabit.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Will you come in, my friend?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Eh! why this is the
tavern of the Corne du Cerf, I think," said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I confess I chose it on
purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I like old
acquaintances; I like to sit down on that place, whereon I sank,
overcome by fatigue, overwhelmed by despair, when you returned on
the 31st of January."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "After having discovered
the abode of the masked executioner?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Yes, that was a terrible day!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Come in, then," said
Athos, interrupting him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> They entered the large
apartment, formerly the common one.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The tavern, in general, and this
room in particular, had undergone great changes; the ancient host
of the musketeers, having become tolerably rich for an innkeeper,
had closed his shop, and make of this room of which we were
speaking, a store-room for colonial provisions.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As for the rest of the house, he let
it ready furnished to strangers.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was with unspeakable emotion
D'Artagnan recognized all the furniture of the chamber of the
first story; the wainscoting, the tapestries, and even that
geographical chart which Porthos had so fondly studied in his
moments of leisure.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is eleven years
ago," cried D'Artagnan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mordioux!</i> it appears
to me a century!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And to me but a day,"
said Athos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Imagine the
joy I experience, my friend, in seeing you there, in pressing
your hand, in casting from me sword and dagger, and tasting
without mistrust this glass of sherry.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And, oh! what still further joy it
would be, if our two friends were there, at the two corners of
the table, and Raoul, my beloved Raoul, on the threshold, looking
at us with his large eyes, at once so brilliant and so soft!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, yes," said
D'Artagnan, much affected, "that is true.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I approve particularly of the first
part of your thought; it is very pleasant to smile there where we
have so legitimately shuddered in thinking that from one moment
to another M. Mordaunt might appear upon the landing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> At this moment the door
opened, and D'Artagnan, brave as he was, could not restrain a
slight movement of fright.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos understood him, and, smiling,
-</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is our host," said
he, "bringing me a letter."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, my lord," said the
good man; "here is a letter for your honor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Thank you," said Athos,
taking the letter without looking at it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Tell me, my dear host, if you do
not remember this gentleman?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The old man raised his
head, and looked attentively at D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No," said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is," said Athos,
"one of those friends of whom I have spoken to you, and who
lodged here with me eleven years ago."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! but," said the old
man, "so many strangers have lodged here!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But we lodged here on
the 30th of January, 1649," added Athos, believing he should
stimulate the lazy memory of the host by this remark.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is very possible,"
replied he, smiling; "but it is so long ago!" and he bowed, and
went out.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Thank you," said
D'Artagnan - "perform exploits, accomplish revolutions, endeavor
to engrave your name in stone or bronze with strong swords! there
is something more rebellious, more hard, more forgetful than
iron, bronze, or stone, and that is, the brain of a lodging-house
keeper who has grown rich in the trade; - he does not know
me!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well, I should have
known him, though."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Athos, smiling at his
friend's philosophy, unsealed his letter.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!" said he, "a letter
from Parry."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! oh!" said
D'Artagnan; "read it, my friend, read it!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No doubt it contains news."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Athos shook his head,
and read:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "MONSIEUR LE COMTE. -
The king has experienced much regret at not seeing you to-day
beside him, at his entrance. <span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His majesty commands me to say so,
and to recall him to your memory.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His majesty will expect you this
evening, at the palace of St. James, between nine and ten
o'clock.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am, respectfully,
monsieur le comte, your honor's very humble and very obedient
servant, - PARRY."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You see, my dear
D'Artagnan," said Athos, "we must not despair of the hearts of
kings."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Not despair! you are
right to say so!" replied D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! my dear, very dear
friend," resumed Athos, whom the almost imperceptible bitterness
of D'Artagnan had not escaped.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Pardon me! can I have
unintentionally wounded my best comrade?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are mad, Athos, and
to prove it, I shall conduct you to the palace; to the very gate,
I mean; the walk will do me good."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You shall go in with
me, my friend; I will speak to his majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, no!" replied
D'Artagnan, with true pride, free from all mixture; "if there is
anything worse than begging yourself, it is making others beg for
you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Come, let us go, my
friend, the walk will be charming; on the way I shall show you
the house of M. Monk, who has detained me with him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A beautiful house, by my faith.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Being a general in England is
better than being a mar&eacute;chal in France, please to
know."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Athos allowed himself to
be led along, quite saddened by D'Artagnan's forced attempts at
gayety.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The whole city
was in a state of joy; the two friends were jostled at every
moment by enthusiasts who required them, in their intoxication,
to cry out, "Long live good King Charles!"<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan replied by a grunt, and
Athos by a smile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They
arrived thus in front of Monk's house, before which, as we have
said, they had to pass on their way to St. James's.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Athos and D'Artagnan
said but little on the road, for the simple reason that they
would have had so many things to talk about if they had
spoken.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos thought
that by speaking he should evince satisfaction, and that might
wound D'Artagnan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
latter feared that in speaking he should allow some little
bitterness to steal into his words which would render his company
unpleasant to his friend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
It was a singular emulation of silence between contentment and
ill-humor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan
gave way first to that itching at the tip of his tongue which he
so habitually experienced.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do you remember,
Athos," said he, "the passage of the 'M&eacute;moires de
D'Aubigny,' in which that devoted servant, a Gascon like myself,
poor as myself, and, I was going to add, brave as myself, relates
instances of the meanness of Henry IV.?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> My father always told me, I
remember, that D'Aubigny was a liar.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But, nevertheless, examine how all
the princes, the issue of the great Henry, keep up the character
of the race."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Nonsense!" said Athos,"
the kings of France misers?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You are mad, my friend."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! you are so perfect
yourself, you never agree to the faults of others.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But, in reality, Henry IV. was
covetous, Louis XIII., his son, was so likewise; we know
something of that, don't we?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Gaston carried this vice to
exaggeration, and has made himself, in this respect, hated by all
who surround him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Henriette, poor woman, might well be avaricious, she who did not
eat every day, and could not warm herself every winter; and that
is an example she has given to her son Charles II., grandson of
the great Henry IV., who is as covetous as his mother and his
grandfather.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> See if I
have well traced the genealogy of the misers?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "D'Artagnan, my friend,"
cried Athos, "you are very rude towards that eagle race called
the Bourbons."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Eh! and I have
forgotten the best instance of all - the other grandson of the
B&eacute;rnais, Louis XIV., my ex-master.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well, I hope he is miserly enough,
he who would not lend a million to his brother Charles!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Good!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I see you are beginning to be
angry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Here we are, by
good luck, close to my house, or rather that of my friend, M.
Monk."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My dear D'Artagnan, you
do not make me angry, you make me sad; it is cruel, in fact, to
see a man of your deserts out of the position his services ought
to have acquired; it appears to me, my dear friend, that your
name is as radiant as the greatest names in war and
diplomacy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Tell me if the
Luynes, the Ballegardes, and the Bassompierres have merited, as
we have, fortunes and honors?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You are right, my friend, a hundred
times right."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan sighed, and
preceded his friend under the porch of he mansion Monk inhabited,
at the extremity of the city.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Permit me," said he, "to leave my
purse at home; for if in the crowd those clever pickpockets of
London, who are much boasted of, even in Paris, were to steal
from me the remainder of my poor crowns, I should not be able to
return to France.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now,
content I left France, and wild with joy I should return to it,
seeing that all my prejudices of former days against England have
returned, accompanied by many others."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Athos made no reply.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "So, then, my dear
friend, one second, and I will follow you," said D'Artagnan.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I know you are in a hurry to
go yonder to receive your reward, but, believe me, I am not less
eager to partake of your joy, although from a distance.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Wait for me."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And D'Artagnan was already passing
through the vestibule, when a man, half servant, half soldier,
who filled in Monk's establishment the double function of porter
and guard, stopped our musketeer, saying to him in English:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I beg your pardon, my
Lord d'Artagnan!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well," replied the
latter: "what is it?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Is
the general going to dismiss me?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I only needed to be expelled by
him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> These words, spoken in
French, made no impression upon the person to whom they were
addressed, and who himself only spoke an English mixed with the
rudest Scots.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But Athos
was grieved at them, for he began to think D'Artagnan was not
wrong.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The Englishman showed
D'Artagnan a letter: "From the general," said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Aye! that's it, my
dismissal!" replied the Gascon.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Must I read it, Athos?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You must be deceived,"
said Athos, "or I know no more honest people in the world but you
and myself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan shrugged his
shoulders and unsealed the letter, while the impassible
Englishman held for him a large lantern, by the light of which he
was enabled to read it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, what is the
matter?" said Athos, seeing the countenance of the reader
change.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Read it yourself," said
the musketeer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Athos took the paper and
read:</p>

"W</span>ell?" cried Athos with a mild look of reproach, when
D'Artagnan had read the letter addressed to him by Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well!" said D'Artagnan,
red with pleasure, and a little with shame, at having so hastily
accused the king and Monk.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "This is a politeness, - which leads
to nothing, it is true, but yet it is a politeness."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I had great difficulty
in believing the young prince ungrateful," said Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

present is still too near his past," replied D'Artagnan; "after
all, everything to the present moment proved me right."</p>

and both directed their steps, at a quick pace, towards the
palace of St. James's, which the crowd still surrounded, to
catch, through the windows, the shadows of the courtiers, and the
reflection of the royal person.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Eight o'clock was striking when the
two friends took their places in the gallery filled with
courtiers and politicians.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Every one looked at these
simply-dressed men in foreign costumes, at these two noble heads
so full of character and meaning.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On their side, Athos and D'Artagnan,
having with two glances taken the measure of the whole assembly,
resumed their chat.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> A great noise was
suddenly heard at the extremity of the gallery, - it was General
Monk, who entered, followed by more than twenty officers, all
eager for a smile, as only the evening before he was master of
all England, and a glorious to-morrow was looked to, for the
restorer of the Stuart family.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Gentlemen," said Monk,
turning round, "henceforward I beg you to remember that I am no
longer anything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Lately I
commanded the principal army of the republic; now that army is
the king's, into whose hands I am about to surrender, at his
command, my power of yesterday."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Great surprise was
painted on all the countenances, and the circle of adulators and
suppliants which surrounded Monk an instant before, was enlarged
by degrees, and ended by being lost in the large undulations of
the crowd.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk was going
into the ante-chamber as others did.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan could not help remarking
this to the Comte de la F&egrave;re, who frowned on beholding
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Suddenly the door of
the royal apartment opened, and the young king appeared, preceded
by two officers of his household.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Good evening,
gentlemen," said he.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Is
General Monk here?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am here, sire,"
replied the old general.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Charles stepped hastily
towards him, and seized his hand with the warmest demonstration
of friendship.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "General,"
said the king, aloud, "I have just signed your patent, - you are
Duke of Albemarle; and my intention is that no one shall equal
you in power and fortune in this kingdom, where - the noble
Montrose excepted - no one has equaled you in loyalty, courage,
and talent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Gentlemen,
the duke is commander of our armies of land and sea; pay him your
respects, if you please, in that character."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Whilst every one was
pressing round the general, who received all this homage without
losing his impassibility for an instant, D'Artagnan said to
Athos: "When one thinks that this duchy, this commander of the
land and sea forces, all these grandeurs, in a word, have been
shut up in a box six feet long and three feet wide - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My friend," replied
Athos, "much more imposing grandeurs are confined in boxes still
smaller, - and remain there forever."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> All at once Monk
perceived the two gentlemen, who held themselves aside until the
crowd had diminished; he made himself a passage towards them, so
that he surprised them in the midst of their philosophical
reflections.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Were you
speaking of me?" sad he, with a smile.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My lord," replied
Athos, "we were speaking likewise of God."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk reflected for a
moment, and then replied gayly: "Gentlemen, let us speak a little
of the king likewise, if you please; for you have, I believe, an
audience of his majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "At nine o'clock," said
Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "At ten o'clock," said
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Let us go into this
closet at once," replied Monk, making a sign to his two
companions to precede him; but to that neither would consent.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king, during this
discussion so characteristic of the French, had returned to the
center of the gallery.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! my Frenchmen!" said
he, in that tone of careless gayety which, in spite of so much
grief and so many crosses, he had never lost.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "My Frenchmen! my consolation!"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos and D'Artagnan
bowed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Duke, conduct these
gentlemen into my study.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
I am at your service, messieurs," added he in French.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he promptly expedited his court,
to return to his Frenchmen, as he called them.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Monsieur d'Artagnan," said he, as
he entered his closet, "I am glad to see you again."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, my joy is at its
height, at having the honor to salute your majesty in your own
palace of St. James's."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur, you have been
willing to render me a great service, and I owe you my gratitude
for it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If I did not fear
to intrude upon the rights of our command general, I would offer
you some post worthy of you near our person."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire," replied
D'Artagnan, "I have quitted the service of the king of France,
making a promise to my prince not to serve any other king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Humph!" said Charles,
"I am sorry to hear that; I should like to do much for you; I
like you very much."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But, let us see," said
Charles with a smile, "if we cannot make you break your
word.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Duke, assist
me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If you were offered,
that is to say, if I offered you the chief command of my
musketeers?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan
bowed lower than before.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I should have the
regret to refuse what your gracious majesty would offer me," said
he; "a gentleman has but his word, and that word, as I have had
the honor to tell your majesty, is engaged to the king of
France."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "We shall say no more
about it, then," said the king, turning towards Athos, and
leaving D'Artagnan plunged in the deepest pangs of
disappointment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I said so!" muttered the
musketeer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Words!
words!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Court holy
water!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Kings have always
a marvelous talent for offering us that which they know we will
not accept, and in appearing generous without risk.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> So be it! - triple fool that I was
to have hoped for a moment!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> During this time,
Charles took the hand of Athos.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Comte," said he, "you have been to
me a second father; the services you have rendered to me are
above all price.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have,
nevertheless, thought of a recompense.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You were created by my father a
Knight of the Garter - that is an order which all the kings of
Europe cannot bear; by the queen regent, Knight of the Holy Ghost
- which is an order not less illustrious; I join to it that of
the Golden Fleece sent me by the king of France, to whom the king
of Spain, his father-in-law, gave two on the occasion of his
marriage; but in return, I have a service to ask of you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire," said Athos, with
confusion, "the Golden Fleece for me! when the king of France is
the only person in my country who enjoys that distinction?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I wish you to be in
your country and all others the equal of all those whom
sovereigns have honored with their favor," said Charles, drawing
the chain from his neck; "and I am sure, comte, my father smiles
on me from his grave."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is unaccountably
strange," said D'Artagnan to himself, whilst his friend, on his
knees, received the eminent order which the king conferred on him
- "it is almost incredible that I have always seen showers of
prosperity fall upon all who surrounded me, and that not a drop
ever reached me!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If I
were a jealous man, it would be enough to make one tear one's
hair, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>parole
d'honneur!</i>"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Athos rose from his
knees, and Charles embraced him tenderly.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "General!" said he to Monk - then
stopping, with a smile, "pardon me, duke, I mean.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No wonder if I make a mistake; the
word duke is too short for me, I always seek some title to
lengthen it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I should
wish to see you so near my throne, that I might say to you, as to
Louis XIV., my brother!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Oh!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have it; and you
will almost be my brother, for I make you viceroy of Ireland and
Scotland, my dear duke.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
So, after that fashion, henceforward I shall not make a
mistake."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The duke seized the hand
of the king, but without enthusiasm, without joy, as he did
everything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His heart,
however, had been moved by this last favor.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Charles, by skillfully husbanding
his generosity, had given the duke time to wish, although he
might not have wished for so much as was given him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mordioux!</i>" grumbled D'Artagnan,
"there is the shower beginning again!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh! it is enough to turn one's
brain!" and he turned away with an air so sorrowful and so
comically piteous, that the king, who caught it, could not
restrain a smile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk
was preparing to leave the room, to take leave of Charles.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What! my trusty and
well-beloved!" said the king to the duke, "are you going?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "With your majesty's
permission, for in truth I am weary.<span style=

out; I stand in need of rest."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But," said the king,
"you are not going without M. d'Artagnan, I hope."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why not, sire?" said
the old warrior.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well! you know very
well why," said the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk looked at Charles
with astonishment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! it may be possible;
but if you forget, you, M. d'Artagnan, do not."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Astonishment was painted
on the face of the musketeer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, then, duke," said
the king, "do you not lodge with M. d'Artagnan?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I had the honor of
offering M. d'Artagnan a lodging; yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That idea is your own,
and yours solely?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well! but it could not
be otherwise - the prisoner always lodges with his
conqueror."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk colored in his
turn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Ah! that is true,"
said he; "I am M. d'Artagnan's prisoner."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Without doubt, duke,
since you are not yet ransomed; but have no care of that; it was
I who took you out of M. d'Artagnan's hands, and it is I who will
pay your ransom."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The eyes of D'Artagnan
regained their gayety and their brilliancy.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The Gascon began to understand.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Charles advanced towards
him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The general," said he,
"is not rich, and cannot pay you what he is worth.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am richer, certainly; but now that
he is a duke, and if not a king, almost a king, he is worth a sum
I could not perhaps pay.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Come, M. d'Artagnan, be moderate with me; how much do I owe
you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan, delighted at
the turn things were taking, but not for a moment losing his
self-possession, replied, - "Sire, your majesty has no occasion
to be alarmed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When I had
the good fortune to take his grace, M. Monk was only a general;
it is therefore only a general's ransom that is due to me.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But if the general will have
the kindness to deliver me his sword, I shall consider myself
paid; for there is nothing in the world but the general's sword
which is worth as much as himself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Odds fish! as my father
said," cried Charles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"That is a gallant proposal, and a gallant man, is he not,
duke?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Upon my honor, yes,
sire," and he drew his sword.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Monsieur," said he to D'Artagnan,
"here is what you demand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Many have handled a better blade; but however modest mine may be,
I have never surrendered it to any one."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan received with
pride the sword which had just made a king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! oh!" cried Charles
II.; "what a sword that has restored me to my throne - to go out
of the kingdom - and not, one day, to figure among the crown
jewels!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No, on my soul!
that shall not be!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Captain d'Artagnan, I will give you two hundred thousand livres
for your sword!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If that
is too little, say so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is too little,
sire," replied D'Artagnan, with inimitable seriousness.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "In the first place, I do not
at all wish to sell it; but your majesty desires me to do so, and
that is an order.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I obey,
then, but the respect I owe to the illustrious warrior who hears
me, commands me to estimate a third more the reward of my
victory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I ask then three
hundred thousand livres for the sword, or I shall give it to your
majesty for nothing."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And
taking it by the point he presented it to the king.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Charles broke into hilarious
laughter.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A gallant man, and a

"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I like him!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Here, Chevalier d'Artagnan, take
this."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And going to the
table, he took a pen and wrote an order upon his treasurer for
three hundred thousand livres.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan took it, and
turning gravely towards Monk: "I have still asked too little, I
know," said he, "but believe me, your grace, I would rather have
died that allow myself to be governed by avarice."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king began to laugh
again, like the happiest cockney of his kingdom.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You will come and see
me again before you go, chevalier?" said he; "I shall want to lay
in a stock of gayety now my Frenchmen are leaving me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! sire, it will not
be with the gayety as with the duke's sword; I will give it to
your majesty gratis," replied D'Artagnan, whose feet scarcely
seemed to touch the ground.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And you, comte," added
Charles, turning towards Athos, "come again, also; I have an
important message to confide to you.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Your hand, duke."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk pressed the hand of the
king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Adieu! gentlemen," said
Charles, holding out each of his hands to the two Frenchmen, who
carried them to their lips.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

they were out of the palace, "are you satisfied?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

wild with joy, "I have not yet returned from the treasurer's - a

D</span>'Artagnan lost no time, and as soon as the thing was
suitable and opportune, he paid a visit to the lord treasurer of
his majesty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had then
the satisfaction to exchange a piece of paper, covered with very
ugly writing, for a prodigious number of crowns, recently stamped
with the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>effigies</i> of
his very gracious majesty Charles II.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan easily
controlled himself: and yet, on this occasion, he could not help
evincing a joy which the reader will perhaps comprehend, if he
deigns to have some indulgence for a man who, since his birth,
had never seen so many pieces and rolls of pieces juxta-placed in
an order truly agreeable to the eye.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The treasurer placed all the rolls
in bags, and closed each bag with a stamp sealed with the arms of
England, a favor which treasurers do not grant to everybody.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then, impassible, and just as
polite as he ought to be towards a man honored with the
friendship of the king, he said to D'Artagnan:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Take away your money,
sir."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Your money!</i><span style=

vibrate in the heart of D'Artagnan, which he had never felt
before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had the bags
packed in a small cart, and returned home meditating deeply.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A man who possessed three
hundred thousand livres can no longer expect to wear a smooth
brow; a wrinkle for every hundred thousand livres is not too
much.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan shut himself
up, ate no dinner, closed his door to everybody, and, with a
lighted lamp, and a loaded pistol on the table, he watched all
night, ruminating upon the means of preventing these lovely
crowns, which from the coffers of the king had passed into his
coffers, from passing from his coffers into the pockets of any
thief whatever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The best
means discovered by the Gascon was to inclose his treasure, for
the present, under locks so solid that no wrist could break them,
and so complicated that no master-key could open them.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan remembered that the
English are masters in mechanics and conservative industry; and
he determined to go in the morning in search of a mechanic who
would sell him a strong box.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He did not go far; Master Will
Jobson, dwelling in Piccadilly, listened to his propositions,

he, "a piece of mechanism entirely new.<span style=

a pretty copper bullet the weight of a mark - which will knock

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

procure him for nothing.</p>

said he; "thank you, sir."<span style=

his friend and found him so thoughtful that he could not help
expressing his surprise.</p>

U</span>pon the green waters of the canal bordered with marble,
upon which time had already scattered black spots and tufts of
mossy grass, there glided majestically a long, flat bark adorned
with the arms of England, surmounted by a dais, and carpeted with
long damasked stuffs, which trailed their fringes in the
water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Eight rowers,
leaning lazily to their oars, made it move upon the canal with
the graceful slowness of the swans, which, disturbed in their
ancient possessions by the approach of the bark, looked from a
distance at this splendid and noisy pageant.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We say noisy - for the bark
contained four guitar and lute players, two singers, and several
courtiers, all sparkling with gold and precious stones, and
showing their white teeth in emulation of each other, to please
the Lady Henrietta Stuart, grand-daughter of Henry IV., daughter
of Charles I., and sister of Charles II., who occupied the seat
of honor under the dais of the bark.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We know this young princess, we have
seen her at the Louvre with her mother, wanting wood, wanting
bread, and fed by the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>coadjuteur</i> and the
parliament.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She had,
therefore, like her brothers, passed through an uneasy youth;
then, all at once, she had just awakened from a long and horrible
dream, seated on the steps of a throne, surrounded by courtiers
and flatterers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Like Mary
Stuart on leaving prison, she aspired not only to life and
liberty, but to power and wealth.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The Lady Henrietta, in
growing, had attained remarkable beauty, which the recent
restoration had rendered celebrated.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Misfortune had taken from her the
luster of pride, but prosperity had restored it to her.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She was resplendent, then, in
her joy and her happiness, - like those hot-house flowers which,
forgotten during a frosty autumn night, have hung their heads,
but which on the morrow, warmed once more by the atmosphere in
which they were born, rise again with greater splendor than
ever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Villiers, Duke of
Buckingham, son of him who played so conspicuous a part in the
early chapters of this history, - Villiers of Buckingham, a
handsome cavalier, melancholy with women, a jester with men, -
and Wilmot, Lord Rochester, a jester with both sexes, were
standing at this moment before the Lady Henrietta, disputing the
privilege of making her smile.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As to that young and beautiful
princess, reclining upon a cushion of velvet bordered with gold,
her hands hanging listlessly so as to dip in the water, she
listened carelessly to the musicians without hearing them, and
heard the two courtiers without appearing to listen to them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This Lady Henrietta -
this charming creature - this woman who joined the graces of
France to the beauties of England, not having yet loved, was
cruel in her coquetry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The smile, then, - that innocent favor of young girls, - did not
even lighten her countenance; and if, at times, she did raise her
eyes, it was to fasten them upon one or other of the cavaliers
with such a fixity, that their gallantry, bold as it generally
was, took the alarm, and became timid.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> In the meanwhile the
boat continued its course, the musicians made a great noise, and
the courtiers began, like them, to be out of breath.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Besides, the excursion became
doubtless monotonous to the princess, for all at once, shaking
her head with an air of impatience, - "Come gentlemen, - enough
of this; - let us land."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah, madam," said
Buckingham, "we are very unfortunate!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We have not succeeded in making the
excursion agreeable to your royal highness."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My mother expects me,"
replied the princess; "and I must frankly admit, gentlemen, I am
bored."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And whilst
uttering this cruel word, Henrietta endeavored to console by a
look each of the two young men, who appeared terrified at such
frankness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The look
produced its effect - the two faces brightened; but immediately,
as if the royal coquette thought she had done too much for simple
mortals, she made a movement, turned her back on both her
adorers, and appeared plunged in a reverie in which it was
evident they had no part.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Buckingham bit his lips
with anger, for he was truly in love with the Lady Henrietta,
and, in that case, took everything in a serious light.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Rochester bit his lips
likewise; but his wit always dominated over his heart, it was
purely and simply to repress a malicious smile.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The princess was then allowing the
eyes she turned from the young nobles to wander over the green
and flowery turf of the park, when she perceived Parry and
D'Artagnan at a distance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Who is coming yonder?"
said she.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

round with the rapidity of lightning.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Parry," replied
Buckingham; "nobody but Parry."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I beg your pardon,"
said Rochester, "but I think he has a companion."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes," said the
princess, at first with languor, but then, - "What mean those
words, 'Nobody but Parry;' say, my lord?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Because, madam,"
replied Buckingham, piqued, "because the faithful Parry, the
wandering Parry, the eternal Parry, is not, I believe, of much
consequence."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are mistaken,
duke.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Parry - the
wandering Parry, as you call him - has always wandered in the
service of my family, and the sight of that old man always gives
me satisfaction."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The Lady Henrietta
followed the usual progress of pretty women, particularly
coquettish women; she passed from caprice to contradiction; - the
gallant had undergone the caprice, the courtier must bend beneath
the contradictory humor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Buckingham bowed, but made no reply.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is true, madam,"
said Rochester, bowing in his turn, "that Parry is the model of
servants; but, madam, he is no longer young, and we laugh only
when we see cheerful objects.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Is an old man a gay object?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Enough, my lord," said
the princess, coolly; "the subject of conversation is unpleasant
to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Then, as if speaking to
herself, "It is really unaccountable," said she, "how little
regard my brother's friends have for his servants."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah, madam," cried
Buckingham, "your royal highness pierces my heart with a dagger
forged by your own hands."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What is the meaning of
that speech, which is turned so like a French madrigal,
duke?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I do not understand
it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It means, madam, that
you yourself, so good, so charming, so sensible, you have laughed
sometimes - smiled, I should say - at the idle prattle of that
good Parry, for whom your royal highness to-day entertains such a
marvelous susceptibility."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, my lord, if I
have forgotten myself so far," said Henrietta, "you do wrong to
remind me of it."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And she
made a sign of impatience.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "The good Parry wants to speak to
me, I believe: please order them to row to the shore, my Lord
Rochester."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Rochester hastened to
repeat the princess's command; and a moment later the boat
touched the bank.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Let us land,
gentlemen," said Henrietta, taking the arm which Rochester
offered her, although Buckingham was nearer to her, and had
presented his.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then
Rochester, with an ill-dissembled pride, which pierced the heart
of the unhappy Buckingham through and through, led the princess
across the little bridge which the rowers had cast from the royal
boat to the shore.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Which way will your
highness go?" asked Rochester.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You see, my lord,
towards that good Parry, who is wandering, as my lord of
Buckingham says, and seeking me with eyes weakened by the tears
he has shed over our misfortunes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Good heavens!" said
Rochester, "how sad your royal highness is to-day; in truth we
seem ridiculous fools to you, madam."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Speak for yourself, my
lord," interrupted Buckingham with vexation; "for my part, I
displease her royal highness to such a degree, that I appear
absolutely nothing to her."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Neither Rochester nor
the princess made any reply; Henrietta only urged her companion
more quickly on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Buckingham remained behind, and took advantage of this isolation
to give himself up to his anger; he bit his handkerchief so
furiously that it was soon in shreds.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Parry, my good Parry,"
said the princess, with her gentle voice, "come hither.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I see you are seeking me, and
I am waiting for you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah, madam," said
Rochester, coming charitably to the help of his companion, who
had remained, as we have said, behind, "if Parry cannot see your
royal highness, the man who follows him is a sufficient guide,
even for a blind man; for he has eyes of flame.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That man is a double-lamped
lantern."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Lighting a very
handsome martial countenance," said the princess, determined to
be as ill-natured as possible.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Rochester bowed.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "One of those vigorous soldiers'
heads seen nowhere but in France," added the princess, with the
perseverance of a woman sure of impunity.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Rochester and Buckingham
looked at each other, as much as to say, - "What can be the
matter with her?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "See, my lord of
Buckingham, what Parry wants," said Henrietta.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Go!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The young man, who
considered this order as a favor, resumed his courage, and
hastened to meet Parry, who, followed by D'Artagnan, advanced
slowly on account of his age.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan walked slowly but nobly,
as D'Artagnan, doubled by the third of a million, ought to walk,
that is to say, without conceit or swagger, but without
timidity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When
Buckingham, very eager to comply with the desire of the princess,
who had seated herself on a marble bench, as if fatigued with the
few steps she had gone, - when Buckingham, we say, was at a
distance of only a few paces from Parry, the latter recognized
him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! my lord!" cried he,
quite out of breath, "will your grace obey the king?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In what, Mr. Parry?"
said the young man, with a kind of coolness tempered by a desire
to make himself agreeable to the princess.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, his majesty begs
your grace to present this gentleman to her royal highness the
Princess Henrietta."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In the first place,
what is the gentleman's name?" said the duke, haughtily.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan, as we know,
was easily affronted, and the Duke of Buckingham's tone
displeased him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He
surveyed the courtier from head to foot, and two flashes beamed
from beneath his bent brows.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But, after a struggle, - "Monsieur
le Chevalier d'Artagnan, my lord," replied he, quietly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Pardon me, sir, that
teaches me your name, but nothing more."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I mean I do not know
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am more fortunate
than you, sir," replied D'Artagnan, "for I have had the honor of
knowing your family, and particularly my lord Duke of Buckingham,
your illustrious father."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My father?" said
Buckingham.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Well, I
think I now remember.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Monsieur le Chevalier d'Artagnan, do you say?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan bowed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "In person," said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Pardon me, but are you
one of those Frenchmen who had secret relations with my
father?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Exactly, my lord duke,
I am one of those Frenchmen."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Then, sir, permit me to
say that it was strange my father never heard of you during his
lifetime."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, monsieur, but he
heard of me at the moment of his death: it was I who sent to him,
through the hands of the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>valet de chambre</i> of Anne of
Austria, notice of the dangers which threatened him;
unfortunately, it came too late."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Never mind, monsieur,"
said Buckingham.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I
understand now, that, having had the intention of rendering a
service to the father, you have come to claim the protection of
the son."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In the first place, my
lord," replied D'Artagnan, phlegmatically, "I claim the
protection of no man.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His
majesty, Charles II., to whom I have had the honor of rendering
some services - I may tell you, my lord, my life has been passed
in such occupations - King Charles II., then, who wishes to honor
me with some kindness, desires me to be presented to her royal
highness the Princess Henrietta, his sister, to whom I shall,
perhaps, have the good fortune to be of service hereafter.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now, the king knew that you at
this moment were with her royal highness, and sent me to
you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There is no other
mystery, I ask absolutely nothing of you; and if you will not
present me to her royal highness, I shall be compelled to do
without you, and present myself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "At least, sir," said
Buckingham, determined to have the last word, "you will not
refuse me an explanation provoked by yourself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I never refuse, my
lord," said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "As you have had
relations with my father, you must be acquainted with some
private details?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "These relations are
already far removed from us, my lord - for you were not then born
- and for some unfortunate diamond studs, which I received from
his hands and carried back to France, it is really not worth
while awakening so many remembrances."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! sir," said
Buckingham, warmly, going up to D'Artagnan, and holding out his
hand to him, "it is you, then - you whom my father sought
everywhere and who had a right to expect so much from us."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To expect, my lord, in
truth, that is my <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>forte</i>; all my life I have
expected."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> At this moment, the
princess, who was tired of not seeing the stranger approach her,
arose and came towards them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "At least, sir," said
Buckingham, "you shall not wait for the presentation you claim of
me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Then turning towards the
princess and bowing: "Madam," said the young man, "the king, your
brother, desires me to have the honor of presenting to your royal
highness, Monsieur le Chevalier d'Artagnan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In order that your
royal highness may have, in case of need, a firm support and a
sure friend," added Parry.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan bowed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You have still
something to say, Parry," replied Henrietta, smiling upon
D'Artagnan, while addressing the old servant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, madam, the king
desires you to preserve religiously in your memory the name and
merit of M. d'Artagnan, to whom his majesty owes, he says, the
recovery of his kingdom."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Buckingham, the princess, and Rochester looked at each other.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That," said D'Artagnan,
"is another little secret, of which, in all probability, I shall
not boast to his majesty's son, as I have done to you with
respect to the diamond studs."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Madam," said
Buckingham, "monsieur has just, for the second time, recalled to
my memory an event which excites my curiosity to such a degree,
that I shall venture to ask your permission to take him to one
side for a moment, to converse in private."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do, my lord," said the
princess; "but restore to the sister, as quickly as possible,
this friend so devoted to the brother."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And she took the arm of Rochester,
whilst Buckingham took that of D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! tell me,
chevalier," said Buckingham, "all that affair of the diamonds,
which nobody knows in England, not even the son of him who was
the hero of it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My lord, one person
alone had a right to relate all that affair, as you call it, and
that was your father; he thought it proper to be silent, I must
beg you to allow me to be so likewise."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And D'Artagnan bowed like a man upon
whom it was evident no entreaties could prevail.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Since it is so, sir,"
said Buckingham, "pardon my indiscretion, I beg you; and if, at
any time, I should go into France - " and he turned round to take
a last look at the princess, who took but little notice of him,
totally occupied as she was, or appeared to be, with
Rochester.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Buckingham
sighed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well?" said
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I was saying that if,
any day, I were to go to France - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You will go, my lord,"
said D'Artagnan, "I shall answer for that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And how so?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, I have strange
powers of prediction; if I do predict anything I am seldom
mistaken.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If, then, you
do come to France?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, then, monsieur,
you, of whom kings ask that valuable friendship which restores
crowns to them, I will venture to beg of you a little of that
great interest you took in my father."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My lord," replied
D'Artagnan, "believe me, I shall deem myself highly honored if,
in France, you remember having seen me here.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And now permit - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Then, turning towards
the princess: "Madam," said he, "your royal highness is a
daughter of France; and in that quality I hope to see you again
in Paris.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> One of my happy
days will be on that on which your royal highness shall give me
any command whatever, thus proving to me that you have not
forgotten the recommendations of your august brother."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he bowed respectfully to
the young princess, who gave him her hand to kiss with a right
royal grace.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! madam," said
Buckingham, in a subdued voice, "what can a man do to obtain a

T</span>he king's words regarding the wounded pride of Monk had
inspired D'Artagnan with no small portion of apprehension.<span

his life, the great art of choosing his enemies; and when he had
found them implacable and invincible, it was when he had not been
able, under any pretense, to make them otherwise.<span style=

the course of a life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It
is a magic lantern, of which the eye of man every year changes
the aspects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It results
that from the last day of a year on which we saw white, to the
first day of the year on which we shall see black, there is the
interval of but a single night.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Now, D'Artagnan, when he
left Calais with his ten scamps, would have hesitated as little
in attacking a Goliath, a Nebuchadnezzar, or a Holofernes, as he
would in crossing swords with a recruit or caviling with a
land-lady.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then he
resembled the sparrow-hawk, which, when fasting, will attack a
ram.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Hunger is
blind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But D'Artagnan
satisfied - D'Artagnan rich - D'Artagnan a conqueror - D'Artagnan
proud of so difficult a triumph - D'Artagnan had too much to lose
not to reckon, figure by figure, with probable misfortune.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> His thoughts were
employed, therefore, all the way on the road from his
presentation, with one thing, and that was, how he should
conciliate a man like Monk, a man whom Charles himself, king as
he was, conciliated with difficulty; for, scarcely established,
the protected might again stand in need of the protector, and
would, consequently, not refuse him, such being the case, the
petty satisfaction of transporting M. d'Artagnan, or of confining
him in one of the Middlesex prisons, or drowning him a little on
his passage from Dover to Boulogne.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Such sorts of satisfaction kings are
accustomed to render to viceroys without disagreeable
consequences.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> It would not be at all
necessary for the king to be active in that <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>contrepartie</i> of the play in
which Monk should take his revenge.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The part of the king would be
confined to simply pardoning the viceroy of Ireland all he should
undertake against D'Artagnan.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Nothing more was necessary to place
the conscience of the Duke of Albemarle at rest than a <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>te absolvo</i> said with a laugh, or
the scrawl of "Charles the King," traced at the foot of a
parchment; and with these two words pronounced, and these two
words written, poor D'Artagnan was forever crushed beneath the
ruins of his imagination.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And then, a thing
sufficiently disquieting for a man with such foresight as our
musketeer, he found himself alone; and even the friendship of
Athos could not restore his confidence.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Certainly if the affair had only
concerned a free distribution of sword-thrusts, the musketeer
would have counted upon his companion; but in delicate dealings
with a king, when the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>perhaps</i> of an unlucky chance
should arise in justification of Monk or of Charles of England,
D'Artagnan knew Athos well enough to be sure he would give the
best possible coloring to the loyalty of the survivor, and would
content himself with shedding floods of tears on the tomb of the
dead, supposing the dead to be his friend, and afterwards
composing his epitaph in the most pompous superlatives.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Decidedly," thought the
Gascon; and this thought was the result of the reflections which
he had just whispered to himself and which we have repeated aloud

proof of his perfect indifference for the past.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If, and God forbid it should be so!
he is still sulky and reserved in the expression of this
sentiment, I shall give my money to Athos to take away with him,

have a quick eye and a light foot, I shall notice the first
hostile sign; to decamp or conceal myself at the residence of my
lord Buckingham, who seems a good sort of devil at the bottom,
and to whom, in return for his hospitality, I shall relate all
that history of the diamonds, which can now compromise nobody but
an old queen, who need not be ashamed, after being the wife of a
miserly creature like Mazarin, of having formerly been the
mistress of a handsome nobleman like Buckingham.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>Mordioux!</i> that is the thing,
and this Monk shall not get the better of me.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Eh? and besides I have an idea!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> We know that, in
general, D'Artagnan was not wanting in ideas; and during this
soliloquy, D'Artagnan buttoned his vest up to the chin, and
nothing excited his imagination like this preparation for a
combat of any kind, called <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>accinction</i> by the Romans.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was quite heated when he
reached the mansion of the Duke of Albemarle.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was introduced to the viceroy
with a promptitude which proved that he was considered as one of
the household.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk was
in his business-closet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My lord," said
D'Artagnan, with that expression of frankness which the Gascon
knew so well how to assume, "my lord, I have come to ask your
grace's advice!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk, as closely
buttoned up morally as his antagonist was physically, replied:
"Ask, my friend;" and his countenance presented an expression not
less open than that of D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My lord, in the first
place, promise me secrecy and indulgence."</p>

wish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What is the

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is, my lord, that I
am not quite pleased with the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Indeed!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And on what account, my dear
lieutenant?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Because his majesty
gives way sometimes to jests very compromising for his servants;
and jesting, my lord, is a weapon that seriously wounds men of
the sword, as we are."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk did all in his
power not to betray his thought, but D'Artagnan watched him with
too close attention not to detect an almost imperceptible flush
upon his face.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Well,
now, for my part," said he, with the most natural air possible,
"I am not an enemy of jesting, my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan; my
soldiers will tell you that even many times in camp, I listened
very indifferently, and with a certain pleasure, to the satirical
songs which the army of Lambert passed into mine, and which,
certainly, would have caused the ears of a general more
susceptible than I am to tingle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, my lord," said
D'Artagnan, "I know you are a complete man; I know you have been,
for a long time, placed above human miseries; but there are jests
and jests of a certain kind, which have the power of irritating
me beyond expression."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "May I inquire what
kind, my friend?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

against my friends or against people I respect, my lord!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk made a slight
movement, which D'Artagnan perceived.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Eh! and in what," asked Monk, "in
what can the stroke of a pin which scratches another tickle your
skin?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Answer me
that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My lord, I can explain
it to you in a single sentence; it concerns you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk advanced a single
step towards D'Artagnan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Concerns me?" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, and this is what I
cannot explain; but that arises, perhaps, from my want of
knowledge of his character.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> How can the king have the heart to
jest about a man who has rendered him so many and such great
services?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> How can one
understand that he should amuse himself in setting by the ears a
lion like you with a gnat like me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I cannot conceive that
in any way," said Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But so it is.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king, who owed me a

that history of the ransom, which affects you, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

laughing: "it does not affect me in any way, I can assure
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Not as regards me, I
can understand; you know me, my lord, I am so discreet that the
grave would appear a babbler compared to me; but - do you
understand, my lord?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No," replied Monk, with
persistent obstinacy.</p>

secret which I know - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, there is that
devil of a box!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk colored
visibly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Well, I have
forgotten it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Deal box," continued
D'Artagnan, "with holes for the nose and mouth.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In truth, my lord, all the rest was
well; but the box, the box! that was really a coarse joke."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk fidgeted about in his
chair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "And,
notwithstanding my having done that," resumed D'Artagnan, "I, a
soldier of fortune, it was quite simple, because by the side of
that action, a little inconsiderate I admit, which I committed,
but which the gravity of the case may excuse, I am circumspect
and reserved."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh!" said Monk,
"believe me, I know you well, Monsieur d'Artagnan, and I
appreciate you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan never took
his eyes off Monk; studying all which passed in the mind of the
general, as he prosecuted <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>his idea.</i><span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "But it does not concern me,"
resumed he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, then, who does it
concern?" said Monk, who began to grow a little impatient.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It relates to the king,
who will never restrain his tongue."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well! and suppose he
should say all he knows?" said Monk, with a degree of
hesitation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My lord," replied
D'Artagnan, "do not dissemble, I implore you, with a man who
speaks so frankly as I do.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You have a right to feel your
susceptibility excited, however benignant it may be.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What, the devil! it is not the place
for a man like you, a man who plays with crowns and scepters as a
Bohemian plays with his balls; it is not the place of a serious
man, I said, to be shut up in a box like some freak of natural
history; for you must understand it would make all your enemies
ready to burst with laughter, and you are so great, so noble, so
generous, that you must have many enemies.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This secret is enough to set half
the human race laughing, if you were represented in that
box.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is not decent to
have the second personage in the kingdom laughed at."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monk was quite out of
countenance at the idea of seeing himself represented in this
box.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Ridicule, as
D'Artagnan had judiciously foreseen, acted upon him in a manner
which neither the chances of war, the aspirations of ambition,
nor the fear of death had been able to do.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Good," thought the
Gascon, "he is frightened: I am safe."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

said Monk, "fear nothing, my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan; the king
will not jest with Monk, I assure you!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The momentary flash of
his eye was noticed by D'Artagnan.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monk lowered his tone immediately:
"The king," continued he, "is of too noble a nature, the king's
heart is too high to allow him to wish ill to those who do him
good."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! certainly," cried
D'Artagnan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I am
entirely of your grace's opinion with regard to his heart, but
not as to his head - it is good, but it is trifling."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

trifle with Monk, be assured."</p>

yes, perfectly!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

so on my account?"</p>

you that I had faith in your loyalty and discretion."</p>

which shines once in the life of every man, which shone for Job
and Iris, the most unfortunate of the Jews and the poorest of the

in very good humor, with his friend Athos; he said nothing to him
about the expected donation, but he could not forbear questioning
his friend, while eating, about country produce, sowing, and
planting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos replied
complacently, as he always did.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His idea was that D'Artagnan wished
to become a land-owner, only he could not help regretting, more
than once, the absence of the lively humor and amusing sallies of
the cheerful companion of former days.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In fact, D'Artagnan was so absorbed,
that, with his knife, he took advantage of the grease left at the
bottom of his plate, to trace ciphers and make additions of
surprising rotundity.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The order, or rather
license, for their embarkation, arrived at Athos's lodgings that
evening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> While this paper
was remitted to the comte, another messenger brought to
D'Artagnan a little bundle of parchments, adorned with all the
seals employed in setting off property deeds in England.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos surprised him turning
over the leaves of these different acts which established the
transmission of property.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The prudent Monk - others would say the generous Monk - had
commuted the donation into a sale, and acknowledged the receipt
of the sum of fifteen thousand crowns as the price of the
property ceded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
messenger was gone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan still continued reading, Athos watched him with a
smile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan,
surprising one of those smiles over his shoulder, put the bundle
in its wrapper.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

said Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

friend," replied the lieutenant, "I shall tell you - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

"when you would have placed that order open upon the table,
saying, 'D'Artagnan, read this scrawl to Porthos, Aramis, and to

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is true.<span

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

allow me to tell you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That delightful time,
that generous season, that ruling by warm blood, were all very
fine things, no doubt: but I do not regret them at all.<span

period of studies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have
constantly met with fools who would boast of the days of pensums,
ferules, and crusts of dry bread.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is singular, but I never loved
all that; for my part, however active and sober I might be (you
know if I was so, Athos), however simple I might appear in my
clothes, I would not the less have preferred the braveries and
embroideries of Porthos to my little perforated cassock, which
gave passage to the wind in winter and the sun in summer.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I should always, my friend,
mistrust him who would pretend to prefer evil to good.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now, in times past all went
wrong with me, and every month found a fresh hole in my cassock
and in my skin, a gold crown less in my poor purse; of that
execrable time of small beer and see-saw, I regret absolutely
nothing, nothing, nothing save our friendship; for within me I
have a heart, and it is a miracle that heart has not been dried
up by the wind of poverty which passed through all the holes of
my cloak, or pierced by the swords of all shapes which passed
through the holes in my poor flesh."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do not regret our
friendship," said Athos, "that will only die with ourselves.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Friendship is composed, above
all things, of memories and habits, and if you have just now made
a little satire upon mine, because I hesitate to tell you the
nature of my mission into France - "</p>

henceforth become to me!"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
And he laid his hand upon the parchment in his vest pocket.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

my friend," said D'Artagnan, "I have never discharged the

purse with the dessert.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I
am now rich, and should like to try if it is heroic to pay."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

returning his purse to his pocket.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

directed their steps towards the port, not, however, without
D'Artagnan's frequently turning round to watch the transportation
of his dear crowns.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Night
had just spread her thick veil over the yellow waters of the
Thames; they heard those noises of casks and pulleys, the
preliminaries of preparing to sail which had so many times made
the hearts of the musketeers beat when the dangers of the sea
were the least of those they were going to face.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This time they were to embark on
board a large vessel which awaited them at Gravesend, and Charles
II., always delicate in small affairs, had sent one of his
yachts, with twelve men of his Scots guard, to do honor to the
ambassador he was sending to France.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At midnight the yacht had deposited
its passengers on board the vessel, and at eight o'clock in the
morning, the vessel landed the ambassador and his friend on the
wharf at Boulogne.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Whilst
the comte, with Grimaud, was busy procuring horses to go straight
to Paris, D'Artagnan hastened to the hostelry where, according to
his orders, his little army was to wait for him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> These gentlemen were at breakfast
upon oysters, fish, and spiced brandy, when D'Artagnan
appeared.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They were all
very gay, but not one of them had yet exceeded the bounds of
reason.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A hurrah of joy
welcomed the general.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Here I am," said D'Artagnan, "the campaign is ended.<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

they in chorus.</p>

D'Artagnan, "then, this is the last order.<span style=

the treasurer of General Monk."</p>

Menneville alone did not evince perfect faith.<span style=

conveyed to a neutral territory, Holland; I forced him to sign
the treaty; I have even reconducted him to Newcastle, and he was

softly, I asked a gratification for you.<span style=

King Charles II., who is one of my friends."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

D'Artagnan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "The king

plucked, it is true, but, in short, I restored him.<span style=

me, for he has pardoned me, could not help repeating these words
to me, which I charge every one of you to engrave deeply there,
between the eyes, under the vault of the cranium: - 'Monsieur,
the joke has been a good one, but I don't naturally like jokes;
if ever a word of what you have done' (you understand me,
Menneville) 'escapes from your lips, or the lips of your
companions, I have, in my government of Scotland and Ireland,
seven hundred and forty-one wooden gibbets, of strong oak,
clamped with iron, and freshly greased every week.<span style=

these gibbets to each of you, and observe well, M. d'Artagnan,'

D'Artagnan, when they were once in the street, "you were not my

D'Artagnan had not for a moment lost sight of a certain
pack-horse, in whose panniers, under some hay, were spread the <i

bags) with the portmanteau.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Nine o'clock was striking at
Saint-Merri.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Planchet's
helps were shutting up his shop.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan stopped the postilion who
rode the pack-horse, at the corner of the Rue des Lombards, under
a pent-house, and calling one of Planchet's boys, he desired him
not only to take care of the two horses, but to watch the
postilion; after which he entered the shop of the grocer, who had
just finished supper, and who, in his little private room, was,
with a degree of anxiety, consulting the calendar, on which,
every evening, he scratched out the day that was past.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the moment when Planchet,
according to his daily custom, with the back of his pen, erased
another day, D'Artagnan kicked the door with his foot, and the
blow made his steel spur jingle.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Oh! good Lord!" cried
Planchet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The worthy
grocer could say no more; he had just perceived his partner.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan entered with a bent
back and a dull eye: the Gascon had an idea with regard to
Planchet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Good God!" thought the
grocer, looking earnestly at the traveler, "he looks sad!"<span

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My dear Monsieur

your health?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Planchet, more and more alarmed, "the expedition has been a
trying one?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

D'Artagnan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A shudder ran
down Planchet's back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I
should like to have something to drink," said the musketeer,
raising his head piteously.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

cupboard, and poured out to D'Artagnan some wine in a large
glass.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan
examined the bottle.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

asked he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Alas! that which you
prefer, monsieur," said Planchet; "that good old Anjou wine,
which was one day nearly costing us all so dear."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!" replied
D'Artagnan, with a melancholy smile, "Ah! my poor Planchet, ought
I still to drink good wine?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Come! my dear master,"
said Planchet, making a super-human effort, whilst all his
contracted muscles, his pallor and his trembling betrayed the
most acute anguish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Come!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have been a
soldier and consequently have some courage; do not make me
linger, dear Monsieur d'Artagnan; our money is lost, is it
not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Before he answered,
D'Artagnan took his time, and that appeared an age to the poor
grocer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Nevertheless he
did nothing but turn about on his chair.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And if that were the

were the case, what would you say, my dear friend?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Planchet, from being
pale, turned yellow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It
might have been thought he was going to swallow his tongue, so
full became his throat, so red were his eyes!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

neck elongated, his legs stretched out, and his hands hanging
listlessly, looked like a statue of discouragement.<span style=

deepest cavities of his breast.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well," said he, "I see
how it is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Let us be

it not?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The principal

share the profits, and if there should be no more profits, well,
why then we shall share the almonds, raisins and prunes, and we
will nibble together the last quarter of Dutch cheese."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

out no longer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "<i style=

D'Artagnan, all radiant, quite transfigured.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! good God!"
articulated Planchet, drawing back before the dazzling fire of
his looks.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

D'Artagnan, "you think me mad!<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Planchet towards the window.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Abdon!<span style=

the window.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

shouted D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

screamed Planchet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Now give ten livres to
the postilion," said D'Artagnan, in the tone he would have
employed in commanding a maneuver; "two lads to bring up the
first two bags, two to bring up the two last, - and move, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>Mordioux!</i> be lively!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Planchet rushed down the
stairs, as if the devil had been at his heels.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A moment later the lads ascended the
stairs, bending beneath their burden.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan sent them off to their
garrets, carefully closed the door, and addressing Planchet, who,
in his turn, looked a little wild, -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Now, we are by
ourselves," said he; and he spread upon the floor a large cover,
and emptied the first bag into it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Planchet did the same with the
second; then D'Artagnan, all in a tremble, let out the precious
bowels of the third with a knife.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When Planchet heard the provoking
sound of the silver and gold - when he saw bubbling out of the
bags the shining crowns, which glittered like fish from the
sweep-net - when he felt himself plunging his hands up to the
elbows in that still rising tide of yellow and white coins, a
giddiness seized him, and like a man struck by lightning, he sank
heavily down upon the enormous heap, which his weight caused to
roll away in all directions.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Planchet, suffocated with joy, had
lost his senses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan threw a glass of white wine in his face, which
incontinently recalled him to life.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

beard.</p>

now, grocers wore the cavalier mustache and the lansquenet beard,

almost unknown now.</p>

I</span>n a large chamber of the Palais Royal, hung with a dark
colored velvet, which threw into strong relief the gilded frames
of a great number of magnificent pictures, on the evening of the
arrival of the two Frenchmen, the whole court was assembled
before the alcove of M. le Cardinal de Mazarin, who gave a card
party to the king and queen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> A small screen separated
three prepared tables.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At
one of these tables the king and the two queens were seated.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis XIV., placed opposite to
the young queen, his wife, smiled upon her with an expression of
real happiness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Anne of
Austria held the cards against the cardinal, and her
daughter-in-law assisted her in the game, when she was not
engaged in smiling at her husband.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As for the cardinal, who was lying
on his bed with a weary and careworn face, his cards were held by
the Comtesse de Soissons, and he watched them with an incessant
look of interest and cupidity.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The cardinal's face had
been painted by Bernouin; but the rouge, which glowed only on his
cheeks, threw into stronger contrast the sickly pallor of his
countenance and the shining yellow of his brow.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His eyes alone acquired a more
brilliant luster from this auxiliary, and upon those sick man's
eyes were, from time to time, turned the uneasy looks of the
king, the queen, and the courtiers.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The fact is, that the two eyes of
the Signor Mazarin were the stars more or less brilliant in which
the France of the seventeenth century read its destiny every
evening and every morning.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monseigneur neither won
nor lost; he was, therefore, neither gay nor sad.<span style=

of pity for him, Anne of Austria would not have willingly left
him; but in order to attract the attention of the sick man by
some brilliant stroke, she must have either won or lost.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To win would have been
dangerous, because Mazarin would have changed his indifference
into an ugly grimace; to lose would likewise have been dangerous,
because she must have cheated, and the infanta, who watched her
game, would, doubtless, have exclaimed against her partiality for
Mazarin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Profiting by
this calm, the courtiers were chatting.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When not in a bad humor, M. de
Mazarin was a very <i style=

he, who prevented nobody from singing, provided they paid, was
not tyrant enough to prevent people from talking, provided they
made up their minds to lose.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> They were therefore
chatting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the first
table, the king's younger brother, Philip, Duc d'Anjou, was
admiring his handsome face in the glass of a box.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His favorite, the Chevalier de
Lorraine, leaning over the back of the prince's chair, was
listening, with secret envy, to the Comte de Guiche, another of
Philip's favorites, who was relating in choice terms the various
vicissitudes of fortune of the royal adventurer Charles II.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He told, as so many fabulous
events, all the history of his perigrinations in Scotland, and
his terrors when the enemy's party was so closely on his track;
of nights spent in trees, and days spent in hunger and
combats.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> By degrees, the
fate of the unfortunate king interested his auditors so greatly,
that the play languished even at the royal table, and the young
king, with a pensive look and downcast eye, followed, without
appearing to give any attention to it, the smallest details of
this Odyssey, very picturesquely related by the Comte de
Guiche.</p>

died before he could have endured all that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

intelligent and proud head.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Madame," said he, in a grave tone,
still partaking something of the timid child, "monsieur le
cardinal will tell you that during my minority the affairs of
France were in jeopardy, - and that if I had been older, and
obliged to take sword in hand, it would sometimes have been for
the purpose of procuring the evening meal."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Thanks to God," said
the cardinal, who spoke for the first time, "your majesty
exaggerates, and your supper has always been ready with that of
your servants."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king colored.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh!" cried Philip,
inconsiderately, from his place, and without ceasing to admire
himself, - "I recollect once, at Melun, the supper was laid for
nobody, and that the king ate two-thirds of a slice of bread, and
abandoned to me the other third."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The whole assembly,
seeing Mazarin smile, began to laugh.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Courtiers flatter kings with the
remembrance of past distresses, as with the hopes of future good
fortune.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is not to be denied
that the crown of France has always remained firm upon the heads
of its kings," Anne of Austria hastened to say, "and that it has
fallen off of that of the king of England; and when by chance
that crown oscillated a little, - for there are throne-quakes as
well as earthquakes, - every time, I say, that rebellion
threatened it, a good victory restored tranquility."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "With a few gems added
to the crown," said Mazarin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The Comte de Guiche was
silent: the king composed his countenance, and Mazarin exchanged
looks with Anne of Austria, as if to thank her for her
intervention.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is of no
consequence," said Philip, smoothing his hair; "my cousin Charles
is not handsome, but he is very brave, and fought like a
landsknecht; and if he continues to fight thus, no doubt he will
finish by gaining a battle, like Rocroi - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He has no soldiers,"
interrupted the Chevalier de Lorraine.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The king of Holland,
his ally, will give him some.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I would willingly have given him
some if I had been king of France."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis XIV. blushed
excessively.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mazarin
affected to be more attentive to his game than ever.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "By this time," resumed
the Comte de Guiche, "the fortune of this unhappy prince is
decided.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If he has been
deceived by Monk, he is ruined.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Imprisonment, perhaps death, will
finish what exiles, battles, and privations have commenced."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Mazarin's brow became
clouded.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is certain," said
Louis XIV., "that his majesty Charles II., has quitted the
Hague?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Quite certain, your
majesty," replied the young man; "my father has received a letter
containing all the details; it is even known that the king has
landed at Dover; some fishermen saw him entering the port; the
rest is still a mystery."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I should like to know
the rest," said Philip, impetuously.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "You know, - you, my brother."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis XIV. colored
again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That was the third
time within an hour.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Ask
my lord cardinal," replied he, in a tone which made Mazarin, Anne
of Austria, and everybody else open their eyes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That means, my son,"
said Anne of Austria, laughing, "that the king does not like
affairs of state to be talked of out of the council."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Philip received the
reprimand with good grace, and bowed, first smiling at his
brother, and then at his mother.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But Mazarin saw from the corner of
his eye that a group was about to be formed in the corner of the
room, and that the Duc d'Anjou, with the Comte de Guiche, and the
Chevalier de Lorraine, prevented from talking aloud, might say,
in a whisper, what it was not convenient should be said.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was beginning, then, to
dart at them glances full of mistrust and uneasiness, inviting
Anne of Austria to throw perturbation in the midst of the
unlawful assembly, when, suddenly, Bernouin, entering from behind
the tapestry of the bedroom, whispered in the ear of Mazarin,
"Monseigneur, an envoy from his majesty, the king of
England."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Mazarin could not help
exhibiting a slight emotion, which was perceived by the
king.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To avoid being
indiscreet, rather than to appear useless, Louis XIV. rose
immediately, and approaching his eminence, wished him
good-night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> All the
assembly had risen with a great noise of rolling of chairs and
tables being pushed away.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Let everybody depart by
degrees," said Mazarin in a whisper to Louis XIV., "and be so
good as to excuse me a few minutes.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am going to dispatch an affair
about which I wish to converse with your majesty this very
evening."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And the queens?" asked
Louis XIV.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And M. le Duc d'Anjou,"
said his eminence.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> At the same time he
turned round in his <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ruelle</i>, the curtains of which,
in falling, concealed the bed.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The cardinal, nevertheless, did not
lose sight of the conspirators.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "M. le Comte de Guiche,"
said he, in a fretful voice, whilst putting on, behind the
curtain, his dressing-gown, with the assistance of Bernouin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am here, my lord,"
said the young man, as he approached.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Take my cards, you are
lucky.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Win a little money
for me of these gentlemen."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The young man sat down
at the table from which the king withdrew to talk with the two
queens.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A serious game
was commenced between the comte and several rich courtiers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the meantime Philip was
discussing the questions of dress with the Chevalier de Lorraine,
and they had ceased to hear the rustling of the cardinal's silk
robe from behind the curtain.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His eminence had followed Bernouin
into the closet adjoining the bedroom.</p>

T</span>he cardinal, on passing into his cabinet, found the Comte
de la F&egrave;re, who was waiting for him, engaged in admiring a
very fine Raphael placed over a sideboard covered with a
plate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His eminence came
in softly, lightly, and as silently as a shadow, and surprised
the countenance of the comte, as he was accustomed to do,
pretending to divine by the simple expression of the face of his
interlocutor what would be the result of the conversation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> But this time Mazarin
was foiled in his expectation: he read nothing upon the face of
Athos, not even the respect he was accustomed to see on all
faces.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos was dressed
in black, with a simple lacing of silver.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He wore the Holy Ghost, the Garter,
and the Golden Fleece, three orders of such importance, that a
king alone, or else a player, could wear them at once.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Mazarin rummaged a long
time in his somewhat troubled memory to recall the name he ought
to give to this icy figure, but he did not succeed.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I am told," said he, at length,
"you have a message from England for me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And he sat down,
dismissing Bernouin, who, in his quality of secretary, was
getting his pen ready.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "On the part of his
majesty, the king of England, yes, your eminence."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You speak very good
French for an Englishman, monsieur," said Mazarin, graciously,
looking through his fingers at the Holy Ghost, Garter, and Golden
Fleece, but more particularly at the face of the messenger.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am not an Englishman,
but a Frenchman, monsieur le cardinal," replied Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is remarkable that
the king of England should choose a Frenchman for his ambassador;
it is an excellent augury.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Your name, monsieur, if you
please."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Comte de la
F&egrave;re," replied Athos, bowing more slightly than the
ceremonial and pride of the all-powerful minister required.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Mazarin bent his
shoulders, as if to say: -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I do not know that
name."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Athos did not alter his
carriage.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And you come,
monsieur," continued Mazarin, "to tell me - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I come on the part of
his majesty the king of Great Britain to announce to the king of
France" - Mazarin frowned - "to announce to the king of France,"
continued Athos, imperturbably, "the happy restoration of his
majesty Charles II. to the throne of his ancestors."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This shade did not
escape his cunning eminence.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mazarin was too much accustomed to
mankind, not to see in the cold and almost haughty politeness of
Athos, an index of hostility, which was not of the temperature of
that hot-house called a court.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You have powers, I
suppose?" asked Mazarin, in a short, querulous tone.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, monseigneur."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And the word "monseigneur"
came so painfully from the lips of Athos that it might be said it
skinned them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Athos took from an
embroidered velvet bag which he carried under his doublet a
dispatch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The cardinal
held out his hand for it. <span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Your pardon, monseigneur," said
Athos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "My dispatch is
for the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Since you are a
Frenchman, monsieur, you ought to know the position of a prime
minister at the court of France."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "There was a time,"
replied Athos, "when I occupied myself with the importance of
prime ministers; but I have formed, long ago, a resolution to
treat no longer with any but the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Then, monsieur," said
Mazarin, who began to be irritated, "you will neither see the
minister nor the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Mazarin rose.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos replaced his dispatch in
its bag, bowed gravely, and made several steps towards the
door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This coolness
exasperated Mazarin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"What strange diplomatic proceedings are these!" cried he.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Have we returned to the times
when Cromwell sent us bullies in the guise of <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>charg&eacute;s d'affaires?</i><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You want nothing, monsieur,
but the steel cap on your head, and a Bible at your girdle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur," said Athos,
dryly, "I have never had, as you have, the advantage of treating
with Cromwell; and I have only seen his <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>charg&eacute;s d'affaires</i> sword
in hand; I am therefore ignorant of how he treated with prime
ministers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As for the
king of England, Charles II., I know that when he writes to his
majesty King Louis XIV., he does not write to his eminence the
Cardinal Mazarin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I see
no diplomacy in that distinction."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!" cried Mazarin,
raising his attenuated hand, and striking his head, "I remember
now!"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos looked at him
in astonishment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Yes,
that is it!" said the cardinal, continuing to look at his
interlocutor; "yes, that is certainly it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I know you now, monsieur.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Ah! <i style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In fact, I was
astonished that, with your eminence's excellent memory," replied
Athos, smiling, "you had not recognized me before."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

grumbling - monsieur - monsieur - What do they call you?<span

"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Delighted to see you again, and to

has cause to complain, I think it could not be you, who got out
of the affair not only in a sound skin, but with the <i style=

your neck."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My lord cardinal,"
replied Athos, "permit me not to enter into considerations of
that kind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have a
mission to fulfill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Will
you facilitate the means of my fulfilling that mission, or will
you not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am astonished," said
Mazarin, - quite delighted at having recovered his memory, and
bristling with malice, - "I am astonished, Monsieur - Athos -
that a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Frondeur</i> like
you should have accepted a mission for the perfidious Mazarin, as
used to be said in the good old times - "<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And Mazarin began to laugh, in spite
of a painful cough, which cut short his sentences, converting
them into sobs.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I have only accepted
the mission near the king of France, monsieur le cardinal,"
retorted the comte, though with less asperity, for he thought he
had sufficiently the advantage to show himself moderate.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And yet, <i style=

As to your secret, I know it better than you do; and you have

He had time, likewise, to see the radiant countenance of the

T</span>he maliciousness of the cardinal did not leave much for
the ambassador to say; nevertheless, the word "restoration" had
struck the king, who, addressing the comte, upon whom his eyes
had been fixed since his entrance, - "Monsieur," said he, "will
you have the kindness to give us some details concerning the
affairs of England.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You
come from that country, you are a Frenchman, and the orders which
I see glittering upon your person announce you to be a man of
merit as well as a man of quality."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur," said the
cardinal, turning towards the queen-mother, "is an ancient
servant of your majesty's, Monsieur le Comte de la
F&egrave;re."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Anne of Austria was as
oblivious as a queen whose life had been mingled with fine and
stormy days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She looked
at Mazarin, whose evil smile promised her something disagreeable;
then she solicited from Athos, by another look, an
explanation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur," continued
the cardinal, "was a Tr&eacute;ville musketeer, in the service of
the late king.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monsieur
is well acquainted with England, whither he has made several
voyages at various periods; he is a subject of the highest
merit."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> These words made
allusion to all the memories which Anne of Austria trembled to
evoke.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> England, that was
her hatred of Richelieu and her love for Buckingham; a
Tr&eacute;ville musketeer, that was the whole Odyssey of the
triumphs which had made the heart of the young woman throb, and
of the dangers which had been so near overturning the throne of
the young queen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> These
words had much power, for they rendered mute and attentive all
the royal personages, who, with very various sentiments, set
about recomposing at the same time the mysteries which the young
had not seen, and which the old had believed to be forever
effaced.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Speak, monsieur," said
Louis XIV., the first to escape from troubles, suspicions, and
remembrances.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, speak," added
Mazarin, to whom the little malicious thrust directed against
Anne of Austria had restored energy and gayety.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

"a sort of miracle has changed the whole destiny of Charles
II.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That which men, till
that time, had been unable to do, God resolved to
accomplish."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

tossing about in his bed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "King Charles II.,"
continued Athos, "left the Hague neither as a fugitive nor a
conqueror, but as an absolute king, who, after a distant voyage
from his kingdom, returns amidst universal benedictions."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A great miracle,
indeed," said Mazarin; "for, if the news was true, King Charles
II., who has just returned amidst benedictions, went away amidst
musket-shots."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king remained
impassible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Philip,
younger and more frivolous, could not repress a smile, which
flattered Mazarin as an applause of his pleasantry.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is plain," said the
king, "there is a miracle; but God, who does so much for kings,
monsieur le comte, nevertheless employs the hand of man to bring
about the triumph of His designs.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To what men does Charles II.
principally owe his re-establishment?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why," interrupted
Mazarin, without any regard for the king's pride - "does not your
majesty know that it is to M. Monk?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I ought to know it,"
replied Louis XIV., resolutely; "and yet I ask my lord
ambassador, the causes of the change in this General Monk?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And your majesty
touches precisely the question," replied Athos; "for without the
miracle of which I have had the honor to speak, General Monk
would probably have remained an implacable enemy of Charles
II.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> God willed that a
strange, bold, and ingenious idea should enter into the mind of a
certain man, whilst a devoted and courageous idea took possession
of the mind of another man.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The combinations of these two ideas
brought about such a change in the position of M. Monk, that,
from an inveterate enemy, he became a friend to the deposed
king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "These are exactly the
details I asked for," said the king.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Who and what are the two men of
whom you speak?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Two Frenchmen,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Indeed!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am glad of that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And the two ideas,"
said Mazarin; - "I am more curious about ideas than about men,
for my part."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes," murmured the
king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The second idea, the
devoted, reasonable idea - the least important, sir - was to go
and dig up a million in gold, buried by King Charles I. at
Newcastle, and to purchase with that gold the adherence of
Monk."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, oh!" said Mazarin,
reanimated by the word million.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "But Newcastle was at the time
occupied by Monk."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, monsieur le
cardinal, and that is why I venture to call the idea courageous
as well as devoted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It
was necessary, if Monk refused the offers of the negotiator, to
reinstate King Charles II. in possession of this million, which
was to be torn, as it were, from the loyalty and not the loyalism
of General Monk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This was
effected in spite of many difficulties: the general proved to be
loyal, and allowed the money to be taken away."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It seems to me," said
the timid, thoughtful king, "that Charles II. could not have
known of this million whilst he was in Paris."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It seems to me,"
rejoined the cardinal, maliciously, "that his majesty the king of
Great Britain knew perfectly well of this million, but that he
preferred having two millions to having one."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire," said Athos,
firmly, "the king of England, whilst in France, was so poor that
he had not even money to take the post; so destitute of hope that
he frequently thought of dying.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was so entirely ignorant of the
existence of the million at Newcastle, that but for a gentleman -
one of your majesty's subjects - the moral depositary of the
million, who revealed the secret to King Charles II., that prince
would still be vegetating in the most cruel forgetfulness."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Let us pass on to the
strange, bold and ingenious idea," interrupted Mazarin, whose
sagacity foresaw a check.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"What was that idea?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "This - M. Monk formed
the only obstacle to the re-establishment of the fallen
king.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A Frenchman
imagined the idea of suppressing this obstacle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! oh! but he is a
scoundrel, that Frenchman," said Mazarin; "and the idea is not so
ingenious as to prevent its author being tied up by the neck at
the Place de Gr&egrave;ve, by decree of the parliament."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your eminence is
mistaken," replied Athos, dryly; "I did not say that the
Frenchman in question had resolved to assassinate M. Monk, but
only to suppress him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
words of the French language have a value which the gentlemen of
France know perfectly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Besides, this is an affair of war; and when men serve kings
against their enemies they are not to be condemned by a
parliament - God is their judge.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This French gentleman, then, formed
the idea of gaining possession of the person of Monk, and he
executed his plan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king became animated
at the recital of great actions.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king's younger brother struck
the table with his hand, exclaiming, "Ah! that is fine!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He carried off Monk?"
said the king.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Why, Monk
was in his camp."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And the gentleman was
alone, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

said Philip.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

cried the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Good!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There are the two little lions
unchained," murmured the cardinal.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And with an air of spite, which he
did not dissemble: "I am unacquainted with these details, will
you guarantee their authenticity, monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "All the more easily, my

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king had
involuntarily drawn close to the count, the Duc d'Anjou had
turned sharply round, and pressed Athos on the other side.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

what next?" cried they both at the same time.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, M. Monk, being
taken by the Frenchman, was brought to King Charles II., at the
Hague.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king gave back
his freedom to Monk, and the grateful general, in return, gave
Charles II. the throne of Great Britain, for which so many
valiant men had fought in vain."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Philip clapped his hands
with enthusiasm, Louis XIV., more reflective, turned towards the
Comte de la F&egrave;re.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

"in all its details?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

gentleman?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> A murmur of admiration
made the heart of Athos swell with pleasure.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had reason to be proud, at
least.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mazarin, himself,
had raised his arms towards heaven.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur," said the
king, "I shall seek and find means to reward you."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos made a movement.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Oh, not for your honesty, to be

having participated in the restoration of my brother, King
Charles II."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Certainly," said
Mazarin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

good cause which fills the whole house of France with joy," said
Anne of Austria.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Louis XIV.: "Is it also true that a single man penetrated to
Monk, in his camp, and carried him off?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And, involuntarily, he darted
a glance at the minister which would have terrified him, if

pillow.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur," said the
young Duc d'Anjou, placing his hand, delicate and white as that
of a woman, upon the arm of Athos, "tell that brave man, I beg
you, that Monsieur, brother of the king, will to-morrow drink his
health before five hundred of the best gentlemen of France."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And, on finishing those words,
the young man, perceiving that his enthusiasm had deranged one of
his ruffles, set to work to put it to rights with the greatest
care imaginable.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Let us resume business,

that moment, M. le Prince came up to them.<span style=

look which distinguishes birds of prey of the noble species; his
physiognomy itself presented several distinct traits of this
resemblance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is known
that in the Prince de Cond&eacute;, the aquiline nose rose out
sharply and incisively from a brow slightly retreating, rather
low than high, and according to the railers of the court, - a
pitiless race without mercy even for genius, - constituted rather
an eagle's beak than a human nose, in the heir of the illustrious
princes of the house of Cond&eacute;.<span style=

imperious expression of the whole countenance, generally
disturbed those to whom the prince spoke, more than either
majesty or regular beauty could have done in the conqueror of

fire mounted so suddenly to his projecting eyes, that with the
prince every sort of animation resembled passion.<span style=

king will soon have a war with Holland or England, and
opportunities for distinguishing himself would not be wanting for
a man who, like you, knows Great Britain as well as you do
France."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I believe I may say,
monseigneur, that I have acted wisely in retiring from the
service," said Athos, smiling.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "France and Great Britain will
henceforward live like two sisters, if I can trust my
presentiments."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

presentiments?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Stop, monseigneur,
listen to what is being said yonder, at the table of my lord the
cardinal."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Where they are
playing?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The cardinal had just
raised himself on one elbow, and made a sign to the king's
brother, who went to him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My lord," said the
cardinal, "pick up, if you please, all those gold crowns."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he pointed to the enormous
pile of yellow and glittering pieces which the Comte de Guiche
had raised by degrees before him by a surprising run of luck at
play.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "For me?" cried the Duc
d'Anjou.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

crowns; yes, monseigneur, they are yours."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do you give them to
me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I have been playing on
your account, monseigneur," replied the cardinal, getting weaker
and weaker, as if this effort of giving money had exhausted all
his physical and moral faculties.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, good heavens!"
exclaimed Philip, wild with joy, "what a fortunate day!"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he himself, making a rake
of his fingers, drew a part of the sum into his pockets, which he
filled, and still full a third remained on the table.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Chevalier," said Philip
to his favorite, the Chevalier de Lorraine, "come hither,
chevalier."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The favorite
quickly obeyed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Pocket
the rest," said the young prince.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This singular scene was
considered by the persons present only as a touching kind of
family <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>f&ecirc;te</i>.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The cardinal assumed the airs
of a father with the sons of France, and the two princes had
grown up under his wing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
No one then imputed to pride, or even impertinence, as would be
done nowadays, this liberality on the part of the first
minister.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The courtiers
were satisfied with envying the prince. - The king turned away
his head.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I never had so much
money before," said the young prince, joyously, as he crossed the
chamber with his favorite to go to his carriage.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "No, never!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What a weight these crowns are!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But why has monsieur le
cardinal given away all this money at once?" asked M. le Prince
of the Comte de la F&egrave;re.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "He must be very ill, the dear
cardinal!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, my lord, very ill,
without doubt; he looks very ill, as your royal highness may
perceive."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But surely he will die
of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A hundred and
fifty thousand livres!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Oh, it is incredible!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
But, comte, tell me a reason for it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Patience, monseigneur,
I beg of you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Here comes
M. le Duc d'Anjou, talking with the Chevalier de Lorraine; I
should not be surprised if they spared us the trouble of being
indiscreet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Listen to
them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> In fact the chevalier
said to the prince in a low voice, "My lord, it is not natural
for M. Mazarin to give you so much money.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Take care! you will let some of the
pieces fall, my lord.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
What design has the cardinal upon you to make him so
generous?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "As I said," whispered
Athos in the prince's ear; "that, perhaps, is the best reply to
your question."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Tell me, my lord,"
repeated the chevalier impatiently, as he was calculating, by
weighing them in his pocket, the quota of the sum which had
fallen to his share by rebound.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My dear chevalier, a
wedding present."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "How a wedding
present?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Eh! yes, I am going to
be married," replied the Duc d'Anjou, without perceiving, at the
moment, he was passing the prince and Athos, who both bowed
respectfully.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The chevalier darted at
the young duke a glance so strange, and so malicious, that the
Comte de la F&egrave;re quite started on beholding it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You! you to be
married!" repeated he; "oh! that's impossible.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You would not commit such a
folly!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Bah!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I don't do it myself; I am made to
do it," replied the Duc d'Anjou.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "But come, quick! let us get rid of
our money."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Thereupon he
disappeared with his companion, laughing and talking, whilst all
heads were bowed on his passage.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Then," whispered the
prince to Athos, "that is the secret."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It was not I who told
you so, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He is to marry the
sister of Charles II.?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I believe so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The prince reflected for
a moment, and his eye shot forth one of its not infrequent
flashes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Humph!" said he
slowly, as if speaking to himself; "our swords are once more to
be hung on the wall - for a long time!" and he sighed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> All that sigh contained
of ambition silently stifled, of extinguished illusions and
disappointed hopes, Athos alone divined, for he alone heard that
sigh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Immediately after,
the prince took leave and the king left the apartment.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos, by a sign made to
Bragelonne, renewed the desire he had expressed at the beginning
of the scene.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> By degrees
the chamber was deserted, and Mazarin was left alone, a prey to
suffering which he could no longer dissemble.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Bernouin!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Bernouin!" cried he in a broken
voice.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What does monseigneur
want?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Gu&eacute;naud - let
Gu&eacute;naud be sent for," said his eminence.<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Bernouin, in great
terror, rushed into the cabinet to give the order, and the <i

T</span>he cardinal's order was pressing; Gu&eacute;naud quickly
obeyed it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He found his
patient stretched on his bed, his legs swelled, his face livid,
and his stomach collapsed.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mazarin had a severe attack of
gout.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He suffered
tortures with the impatience of a man who has not been accustomed
to resistances.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On seeing
Gu&eacute;naud: "Ah!" said he; "now I am saved!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Gu&eacute;naud was a
very learned and circumspect man, who stood in no need of the
critiques of Boileau to obtain a reputation.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When facing a disease, if it were
personified in a king, he treated the patient as a Turk treats a
Moor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He did not,
therefore, reply to Mazarin as the minister expected: "Here is
the doctor; good-bye disease!"<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On the contrary, on examining his
patient, with a very serious air:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! oh!" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Mazarin raised himself
upon his elbow, and, questioning by look and gesture: "What do
you mean by that?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Am I
worse than I believe myself to be?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My lord," said
Gu&eacute;naud, seating himself beside the bed; "your eminence
has worked very hard during your life; your eminence has suffered
much."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But I am not old, I
fancy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The late M. de

died, and died of a mortal disease.<span style=

remember, I am scarcely fifty-two."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! my lord, you are
much more than that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> How
long did the Fronde last?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

put such a question to me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

calculation, monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

off and on."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

enough to reckon every year of the Fronde as three years - that
makes thirty; now twenty and fifty-two makes seventy-two
years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You are
seventy-two, my lord; and that is a great age."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Whilst saying this, he
felt the pulse of his patient.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This pulse was full of such fatal
indications, that the physician continued, notwithstanding the
interruptions of the patient: "Put down the years of the Fronde
at four each, and you have lived eighty-two years."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Are you speaking
seriously, Gu&eacute;naud?"</p>

monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

necessary to do so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

with such difficulty that he inspired pity even in a pitiless
physician.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "There are
diseases and diseases," resumed Mazarin.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "From some of them people
escape."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Mazarin, almost joyously; "for, in short, what else would be the
use of power, of strength of will?<span style=

your genius, Gu&eacute;naud?<span style=

from peril?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

to open his mouth, but Mazarin continued:</p>

then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

neither strength of will, nor power, nor genius, nor science that
can resist a disease which God doubtless sends, or which He cast

kill mankind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When the
disease is mortal, and nothing can - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

for a moment, like an unfortunate wretch who is crushed by a
falling column.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But the
spirit of Mazarin was a strong one, or rather his mind was a firm
one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Gu&eacute;naud,"

the cardinal resumed his senses and recovered his strength,
succeeded to the agitation of this scene.<span style=

Mazarin; "there are empirics and charlatans.<span style=

"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> During the whole evening he had
remained in one of the corridors, chatting with Bernouin and
Brienne, and commenting, with the ordinary skill of people of
court, upon the news which developed like air-bubbles upon the
water, on the surface of each event.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is doubtless time to trace, in a
few words, one of the most interesting portraits of the age, and
to trace it with as much truth, perhaps, as contemporary painters
have been able to do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Colbert was a man in whom the historian and the moralist have an
equal right.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> He was thirteen years
older than Louis XIV., his future master.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Of middle height, rather lean than
otherwise, he had deep-set eyes, a mean appearance, his hair was
coarse, black and thin, which, say the biographers of his time,
made him take early to the skull-cap.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A look of severity, of harshness
even, a sort of stiffness, which, with inferiors, was pride, with
superiors an affectation of superior virtue; a surly cast of
countenance upon all occasions, even when looking at himself in a
glass alone - such is the exterior of his personage.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As to the moral part of his
character, the depth of his talent for accounts, and his
ingenuity in making sterility itself productive, were much
boasted of.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Colbert had
formed the idea of forcing governors of frontier places to feed
the garrisons without pay, with what they drew from
contributions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Such a
valuable quality made Mazarin think of replacing Joubert, his
intendant, who had recently died, by M. Colbert, who had such
skill in nibbling down allowances.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Colbert by degrees crept into court,
notwithstanding his lowly birth, for he was the son of a man who
sold wine as his father had done, but who afterwards sold cloth,
and then silk stuffs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Colbert, destined for trade, had been clerk in Lyons to a
merchant, whom he had quitted to come to Paris in the office of a
Ch&acirc;tlet procureur named Biterne.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was here he learned the art of
drawing up an account, and the much more valuable one of
complicating it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This stiffness of manner
in Colbert had been of great service to him; it is so true that
Fortune, when she has a caprice, resembles those women of
antiquity, who, when they had a fancy, were disgusted by no
physical or moral defects in either men or things.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Colbert, placed with Michel
Letellier, secretary of state in 1648, by his cousin Colbert,
Seigneur de Saint-Penange, who protected him, received one day
from the minister a commission for Cardinal Mazarin.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His eminence was then in the
enjoyment of flourishing health, and the bad years of the Fronde
had not yet counted triple and quadruple for him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was at Sedan, very much annoyed
at a court intrigue in which Anne of Austria seemed inclined to
desert his cause.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Of this intrigue
Letellier held the thread.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had just received a letter from
Anne of Austria, a letter very valuable to him, and strongly
compromising Mazarin; but, as he already played the double part
which served him so well, and by which he always managed two
enemies so as to draw advantage from both, either by embroiling
them more and more or by reconciling them, Michel Letellier
wished to send Anne of Austria's letter to Mazarin, in order that
he might be acquainted with it, and consequently pleased with his
having so willingly rendered him a service.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To send the letter was an easy
matter; to recover it again, after having communicated it, that
was the difficulty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Letellier cast his eyes around him, and seeing the black and
meager clerk with the scowling brow, scribbling away in his
office, he preferred him to the best gendarme for the execution
of this design.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Colbert was commanded to
set out for Sedan, with positive orders to carry the letter to
Mazarin, and bring it back to Letellier.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He listened to his orders with
scrupulous attention, required the instructions to be repeated
twice, and was particular in learning whether the bringing back
was as necessary as the communicating, and Letellier replied
sternly, "More necessary."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then he set out, traveled like a
courier, without any care for his body, and placed in the hands
of Mazarin, first a letter from Letellier, which announced to the
cardinal the sending of the precious letter, and then that letter
itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mazarin colored
greatly whilst reading Anne of Austria's letter, gave Colbert a
gracious smile and dismissed him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "When shall I have the
answer, monseigneur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To-morrow."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To-morrow morning?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The clerk turned upon
his heel, after making his very best bow.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The next day he was at his post at
seven o'clock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mazarin
made him wait till ten.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
He remained patiently in the ante-chamber; his turn having come,
he entered; Mazarin gave him a sealed packet.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On the envelope of this packet were
these words: - Monsieur Michel Letellier, etc.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Colbert looked at the packet with
much attention; the cardinal put on a pleasant countenance and
pushed him towards the door.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And the letter of the
queen-mother, my lord?" asked Colbert.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is in with the rest,
in the packet," said Mazarin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! very well," replied
Colbert; and placing his hat between his knees, he began to
unseal the packet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Mazarin uttered a
cry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "What are you
doing?" said he, angrily.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am unsealing the
packet, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You mistrust me, then,
master pedant, do you?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Did any one ever see such impertinence?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! my lord, do not be
angry with me!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is
certainly not your eminence's word I place in doubt, God
forbid!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is the carefulness
of your chancery, my lord.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What is a letter?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A rag.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> May not a rag be forgotten?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And look, my lord, look if I
was not right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Your
clerks have forgotten the rag; the letter is not in the
packet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are an insolent
fellow, and you have not looked," cried Mazarin, very angrily;
"begone and wait my pleasure."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Whilst saying these words, with
perfectly Italian subtlety he snatched the packet from the hands
of Colbert, and re-entered his apartments.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> But this anger could not
last so long as to be replaced in time by reason.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mazarin, every morning, on opening
his closet door, found the figure of Colbert like a sentinel
behind the bench, and this disagreeable figure never failed to
ask him humbly, but with tenacity, for the queen-mother's
letter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mazarin could
hold out no longer, and was obliged to give it up.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He accompanied this restitution with
a most severe reprimand, during which Colbert contented himself
with examining, feeling, even smelling, as it were, the paper,
the characters, and the signature, neither more nor less than if
he had to deal with the greatest forger in the kingdom.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mazarin behaved still more
rudely to him, but Colbert, still impassible, having obtained a
certainty that the letter was the true one, went off as if he had
been deaf.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This conduct
obtained for him afterwards the post of Joubert; for Mazarin,
instead of bearing malice, admired him, and was desirous of
attaching so much fidelity to himself.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> It may be judged by this
single anecdote, what the character of Colbert was.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Events, developing themselves, by
degrees allowed all the powers of his mind to act freely.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Colbert was not long in
insinuating himself to the good graces of the cardinal: he became
even indispensable to him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The clerk was acquainted with all
his accounts without the cardinal's ever having spoken to him
about them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This secret
between them was a powerful tie, and this was why, when about to
appear before the Master of another world, Mazarin was desirous
of taking good counsel in disposing the wealth he was so
unwillingly obliged to leave in this world.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> After the visit of Gu&eacute;naud,
he therefore sent for Colbert, desired him to sit down, and said
to him: "Let us converse, Monsieur Colbert, and seriously, for I
am very ill, and I may chance to die."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Man is mortal," replied
Colbert.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I have always
remembered that, M. Colbert, and I have worked with that end in
view.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You know that I
have amassed a little wealth."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I know you have,
monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "At how much do you
estimate, as near as you can, the amount of this wealth, M.
Colbert?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "At forty millions, five
hundred and sixty thousand, two hundred livres, nine cents, eight
farthings," replied Colbert.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The cardinal heaved a
deep sigh, and looked at Colbert with wonder, but he allowed a
smile to steal across his lips.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Known money," added
Colbert, in reply to that smile.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The cardinal gave quite
a start in bed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "What do
you mean by that?" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I mean," said Colbert,
"that besides those forty millions, five hundred and sixty
thousand, two hundred livres, nine cents, eight farthings, there
are thirteen millions that are not known."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ouf!</i>" sighed Mazarin, "what a
man!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> At this moment, the head
of Bernouin appeared through the embrasure of the door.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What is it?" asked
Mazarin, "and why do you disturb me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The Th&eacute;atin
father, your eminence's director, was sent for this evening; and
he cannot come again to my lord till after to-morrow."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Mazarin looked a
Colbert, who rose and took his hat, saying: "I shall come again,
my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Mazarin hesitated.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "No, no," said he; "I have as
much business to transact with you as with him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Besides, you are my other confessor
- and what I have to say to one the other may hear.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Remain where you are, Colbert."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But my lord, if there
be no secret of penitence, will the director consent to my being
here?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

good to hear the confession of a rich man."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

into the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ruelle</i>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Colbert started.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The cardinal was indeed very
ill; large drops of sweat flowed down upon his bed of agony, and
the frightful pallor of a face streaming with water was a
spectacle which the most hardened practitioner could not have
beheld without much compassion.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Colbert was, without doubt, very
much affected, for he quitted the chamber, calling Bernouin to
attend to the dying man, and went into the corridor.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There, walking about with a
meditative expression, which almost gave nobility to his vulgar
head, his shoulders thrown up, his neck stretched out, his lips
half open, to give vent to unconnected fragments of incoherent
thoughts, he lashed up his courage to the pitch of the
undertaking contemplated, whilst within ten paces of him,
separated only by a wall, his master was being stifled by anguish
which drew from him lamentable cries, thinking no more of the
treasures of the earth, or of the joys of Paradise, but much of
all the horrors of hell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Whilst burning-hot napkins, physic, revulsives, and
Gu&eacute;naud, who was recalled, were performing their functions
with increased activity, Colbert, holding his great head in both
his hands, to compress within it the fever of the projects
engendered by the brain, was meditating the tenor of the donation
he would make Mazarin write, at the first hour of respite his
disease should afford him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It would appear as if all the cries
of the cardinal, and all the attacks of death upon this
representative of the past, were stimulants for the genius of
this thinker with the bushy eyebrows, who was turning already
towards the rising sun of a regenerated society.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Colbert resumed his place at
Mazarin's pillow at the first interval of pain, and persuaded him
to dictate a donation thus conceived.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "About to appear before
God, the Master of mankind, I beg the king, who was my master on

it immediately to the Louvre, whither the king had returned.</p>

T</span>he news of the extreme illness of the cardinal had
already spread, and attracted at least as much attention among
the people of the Louvre as the news of the marriage of Monsieur,
the king's brother, which had already been announced as an
official fact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Scarcely
had Louis XIV. returned home, with his thoughts fully occupied
with the various things he had seen and heard in the course of
the evening, when an usher announced that the same crowd of
courtiers who, in the morning, had thronged his <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>lever</i>, presented themselves
again at his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>coucher</i>, a
remarkable piece of respect which, during the reign of the
cardinal, the court, not very discreet in its performance, had
accorded to the minister, without caring about displeasing the
king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> But the minister had
had, as we have said, an alarming attack of gout, and the tide of
flattery was mounting towards the throne.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Courtiers have a marvelous instinct
in scenting the turn of events; courtiers possess a supreme kind
of science; they are diplomatists in throwing light upon the
unraveling of complicated intrigues, captains in divining the
issue of battles, and physicians in curing the sick.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis XIV., to whom his mother had
taught this axiom, together with many others, understood at once
that the cardinal must be very ill.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Scarcely had Anne of
Austria conducted the young queen to her apartments and taken
from her brow the head-dress of ceremony, when she went to see
her son in his cabinet, where, alone, melancholy, and depressed,
he was indulging, as if to exercise his will, in one of those
terrible inward passions - king's passions - which create events
when they break out, and with Louis XIV., thanks to his
astonishing command over himself, became such benign tempests,
that his most violent, his only passion, that which Saint Simon
mentions with astonishment, was that famous fit of anger which he
exhibited fifty years later, on the occasion of a little
concealment of the Duc de Maine's, and which had for result a
shower of blows inflicted with a cane upon the back of a poor
valet who had stolen a biscuit.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The young king then was, as we have
seen, a prey to a double excitement; and he said to himself as he
looked in a glass, "O king! - king by name, and not in fact; -
phantom, vain phantom art thou! - inert statue, which has no
other power than that of provoking salutations from courtiers,
when wilt thou be able to raise thy velvet arm, or clench thy
silken hand? when wilt thou be able to open, for any purpose but
to sigh, or smile, lips condemned to the motionless stupidity of
the marbles in thy gallery?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Then, passing his hand
over his brow, and feeling the want of air, he approached a
window, and looking down, saw below some horsemen talking
together, and groups of timid observers.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> These horsemen were a fraction of
the watch: the groups were busy portions of the people, to whom a
king is always a curious thing, the same as a rhinoceros, a
crocodile, or a serpent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
He struck his brow with his open hand, crying, - "King of France!
what a title!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> People of
France! what a heap of creatures!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have just returned to my Louvre;
my horses, just unharnessed, are still smoking, and I have
created interest enough to induce scarcely twenty persons to look
at me as I passed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Twenty! what do I say? no; there were not twenty anxious to see
the king of France.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There
are not even ten archers to guard my palace of residence:
archers, people, guards, all are at the Palais Royal!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Why, my good God! have not I, the
king, the right to ask of you all that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Because," said a voice,
replying to his, and which sounded from the other side of the
door of the cabinet, "because at the Palais Royal lies all the
gold, - that is to say, all the power of him who desires to
reign."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis turned round
sharply.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The voice which
had pronounced these words was that of Anne of Austria.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king started, and advanced
towards her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I hope,"
said he, "you majesty has paid no attention to the vain
declamations which the solitude and disgust familiar to kings
suggest to the happiest dispositions?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I only paid attention
to one thing, my son, and that was, that you were
complaining."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Who!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Not at all," said Louis XIV.; "no,
in truth, you err, madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What were you doing,
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I thought I was under
the ferule of my professor, and developing a subject of
amplification."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My son," replied Anne
of Austria, shaking her head, "you are wrong not to trust my
word; you are wrong not to grant me your confidence.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A day will come, and perhaps
quickly, wherein you will have occasion to remember that axiom: -
'Gold is universal power; and they alone are kings who are
all-powerful.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your intention,"
continued the king, "was not, however, to cast blame upon the
rich men of this age, was it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No," said the queen,
warmly; "no, sire; they who are rich in this age, under your
reign, are rich because you have been willing they should be so,
and I entertain against them neither malice nor envy; they have,
without doubt, served your majesty sufficiently well for your
majesty to have permitted them to reward themselves.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That is what I mean to say by the
words for which you reproach me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "God forbid, madame,
that I should ever reproach my mother with anything!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Besides," continued
Anne of Austria, "the Lord never gives the goods of this world
but for a season; the Lord - as correctives to honor and riches -
the Lord has placed sufferings, sickness, and death; and no one,"
added she, with a melancholy smile, which proved she made the
application of the funeral precept to herself, "no man can take
his wealth or greatness with him to the grave.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It results, therefore, that the
young gather the abundant harvest prepared for them by the
old."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis listened with
increased attention to the words which Anne of Austria, no doubt,
pronounced with a view to console him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Madame," said he, looking earnestly
at his mother, "one would almost say in truth that you had
something else to announce to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I have absolutely
nothing, my son; only you cannot have failed to remark that his
eminence the cardinal is very ill."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis looked at his
mother, expecting some emotion in her voice, some sorrow in her
countenance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The face of
Anne of Austria appeared a little changed, but that was from
sufferings of quite a personal character.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Perhaps the alteration was caused by
the cancer which had begun to consume her breast.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Yes, madame," said the king; "yes,
M. de Mazarin is very ill."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And it would be a great
loss to the kingdom if God were to summon his eminence away.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Is not that your opinion as
well as mine, my son?" said the queen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, madame; yes,
certainly, it would be a great loss for the kingdom," said Louis,
coloring; "but the peril does not seem to me to be so great;
besides, the cardinal is still young."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king had scarcely ceased
speaking when an usher lifted the tapestry, and stood with a
paper in his hand, waiting for the king to speak to him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What have you there?"
asked the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A message from M. de
Mazarin," replied the usher.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Give it to me," said
the king; and he took the paper.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But at the moment he was about to
open it, there was a great noise in the gallery, the
ante-chamber, and the court.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah, ah," said Louis
XIV., who doubtless knew the meaning of that triple noise.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "How could I say there was but
one king in France!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I was
mistaken, there are two."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> As he spoke or thought
thus, the door opened, and the superintendent of finances,
Fouquet, appeared before his nominal master.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was he who made the noise in the
ante-chamber, it was his horse that made the noise in the
courtyard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In addition to
all this, a loud murmur was heard along his passage, which did
not die away till some time after he had passed.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was this murmur which Louis XIV.
regretted so deeply not hearing as he passed, and dying away
behind him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He is not precisely a
king, as you fancy," said Anne of Austria to her son; "he is only
a man who is much too rich - that is all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Whilst saying these
words, a bitter feeling gave to these words of the queen a most
hateful expression; whereas the brow of the king, calm and
self-possessed, on the contrary, was without the slightest
wrinkle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He nodded,
therefore, familiarly to Fouquet, whilst he continued to unfold
the paper given to him by the usher.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fouquet perceived this movement, and
with a politeness at once easy and respectful, advanced towards
the queen, so as not to disturb the king.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis had opened the paper, and yet
he did not read it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He
listened to Fouquet paying the most charming compliments to the
queen upon her hand and arm.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Anne of Austria's frown relaxed a
little, she even almost smiled.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fouquet perceived that the king,
instead of reading, was looking at him; he turned half round,
therefore, and while continuing his conversation with the queen,
faced the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You know, Monsieur
Fouquet," said Louis, "how ill M. Mazarin is?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, sire, I know
that," said Fouquet; "in fact, he is very ill.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I was at my country-house of Vaux
when the news reached me; and the affair seemed so pressing that
I left at once."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You left Vaux this
evening, monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "An hour and a half ago,
yes, your majesty," said Fouquet, consulting a watch, richly
ornamented with diamonds.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "An hour and a half!"
said the king, still able to restrain his anger, but not to
conceal his astonishment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I understand you,
sire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Your majesty doubts
my word, and you have reason to do so; but I have really come in
that time, though it is wonderful!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I received from England three pairs
of very fast horses, as I had been assured.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They were placed at distances of
four leagues apart, and I tried them this evening.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They really brought me from Vaux to
the Louvre in an hour and a half, so your majesty sees I have not
been cheated."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
queen-mother smiled with something like secret envy.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But Fouquet caught her thought.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Thus, madame," he promptly
said, "such horses are made for kings, not for subjects; for
kings ought never to yield to any one in anything."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king looked up.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And yet," interrupted
Anne of Austria, "you are not a king, that I know of, M.
Fouquet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Truly not, madame;
therefore the horses only await the orders of his majesty to
enter the royal stables; and if I allowed myself to try them, it
was only for fear of offering to the king anything that was not
positively wonderful."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king became quite
red.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You know, Monsieur
Fouquet," said the queen, "that at the court of France it is not
the custom for a subject to offer anything to his king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis started.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I hoped, madame," said
Fouquet, much agitated, "that my love for his majesty, my
incessant desire to please him, would serve to compensate the
want of etiquette.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was
not so much a present that I permitted myself to offer, as the
tribute I paid."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Thank you, Monsieur
Fouquet," said the king politely, "and I am gratified by your
intention, for I love good horses; but you know I am not very
rich; you, who are my superintendent of finances, know it better
than any one else.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am
not able, then, however willing I may be, to purchase such a
valuable set of horses."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Fouquet darted a haughty
glance at the queen-mother, who appeared to triumph at the false
position in which the minister had placed himself, and replied:
-</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Luxury is the virtue of
kings, sire: it is luxury which makes them resemble God; it is by
luxury they are more than other men.<span style=

Perche, and Normandy; and this emulation would have been

the king is silent, and consequently I am condemned."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Louis was, unconsciously, folding and unfolding Mazarin's paper,
upon which he had not cast his eyes.<span style=

uttered a faint cry at reading the first line.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What is the matter, my
son?" asked the queen, anxiously, and going towards the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

replied the king, continuing to read; "yes, yes, it is really
from him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Read!" said the king,
passing the parchment to his mother, as if he thought that
nothing less than reading would convince Anne of Austria of a
thing so astonishing as was conveyed in that paper.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Anne of Austria read in
turn, and as she read, her eyes sparkled with joy all the greater
from her useless endeavor to hide it, which attracted the
attention of Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! a regularly drawn
up deed of gift," said she.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes," said the king,
replying pointedly to the superintendent of finances, "yes, at
the point of death, monsieur le cardinal makes me a donation of
all his wealth."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Forty millions," cried
the queen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Oh, my son!
this is very noble on the part of his eminence, and will silence
all malicious rumors; forty millions scraped together slowly,
coming back all in one heap to the treasury!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is the act of a faithful subject
and a good Christian."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
And having once more cast her eyes over the act, she restored it
to Louis XIV., whom the announcement of the sum greatly
agitated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fouquet had
taken some steps backwards and remained silent.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king looked at him, and held the
paper out to him, in turn.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The superintendent only bestowed a
haughty look of a second upon it; then bowing, - "Yes, sire,"
said he, "a donation, I see."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You must reply to it,

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Write!" said the young
king, with evident repugnance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well!" replied Anne of
Austria, "it seems to me, my son, that a man who has just made
such a present, has a good right to expect to be thanked for it
with some degree of promptitude."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then turning towards Fouquet: "Is
not that likewise your opinion, monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That the present is
worth the trouble?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Yes,
madame," said Fouquet, with a lofty air that did not escape the
king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Accept, then, and thank
him," insisted Anne of Austria.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

asked Louis XIV.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

to know my opinion?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Thank him, sire - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!" said the
queen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But do not accept,"
continued Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And why not?" asked the
queen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You have yourself said
why, madame," replied Fouquet; "because kings cannot and ought
not to receive presents from their subjects."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king remained silent
between these two contrary opinions.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But forty millions!"
said Anne of Austria, in the same tone as that in which, at a
later period, poor Marie Antoinette replied, "You will tell me as
much!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I know," said Fouquet,
laughing, "forty millions makes a good round sum, - such a sum as
could almost tempt a royal conscience."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But, monsieur," said
Anne of Austria, "instead of persuading the king not to receive
this present, recall to his majesty's mind, you, whose duty it
is, that these forty millions are a fortune to him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is precisely,
madame, because these forty millions would be a fortune that I
will say to the king, 'Sire, if it be not decent for a king to
accept from a subject six horses, worth twenty thousand livres,
it would be disgraceful for him to owe a fortune to another
subject, more or less scrupulous in the choice of the materials
which contributed to the building up of that fortune.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It ill becomes you,
monsieur, to give your king a lesson," said Anne of Austria;
"better procure for him forty millions to replace those you make
him lose."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The king shall have
them whenever he wishes," said the superintendent of finances,
bowing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, by oppressing the
people," said the queen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And were they not
oppressed, madame," replied Fouquet, "when they were made to
sweat the forty millions given by this deed?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Furthermore, his majesty has asked
my opinion, I have given it; if his majesty ask my concurrence,
it will be the same."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Nonsense! accept, my

"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "You are above reports and
interpretations."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Refuse, sire," said
Fouquet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "As long as a
king lives, he has no other measure but his conscience, - no
other judge than his own desires; but when dead, he has
posterity, which applauds or accuses."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Thank you, mother,"
replied Louis, bowing respectfully to the queen.<span style=

he, dismissing the superintendent civilly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Anne of Austria, once more.</p>

T</span>he day that the deed of gift had been sent to the king,
the cardinal caused himself to be transported to Vincennes.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king and the court
followed him thither.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
last flashes of this torch still cast splendor enough around to
absorb all other lights in its rays.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Besides, as it has been seen, the
faithful satellite of his minister, young Louis XIV., marched to
the last minute in accordance with his gravitation.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The disease, as Gu&eacute;naud had
predicted, had become worse; it was no longer an attack of gout,
it was an attack of death; then there was another thing which
made that agony more agonizing still, - and that was the
agitation brought into his mind by the donation he had sent to
the king, and which, according to Colbert, the king ought to send
back unaccepted to the cardinal.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The cardinal had, as we have said,
great faith in the predictions of his secretary; but the sum was
a large one, and whatever might be the genius of Colbert, from
time to time the cardinal thought to himself that the
Th&eacute;atin also might possibly have been mistaken, and there
was at least as much chance of his not being damned, as there was
of Louis XIV. sending back his millions.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Besides, the longer the
donation was in coming back, the more Mazarin thought that forty
millions were worth a little risk, particularly of so hypothetic
a thing as the soul.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Mazarin, in his character of cardinal and prime minister, was
almost an atheist, and quite a materialist.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Every time that the door opened, he
turned sharply round towards that door, expecting to see the
return of his unfortunate donation; then, deceived in his hope,
he fell back again with a sigh, and found his pains so much the
greater for having forgotten them for an instant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Anne of Austria had also
followed the cardinal; her heart, though age had made it selfish,
could not help evincing towards the dying man a sorrow which she
owed him as a wife, according to some; and as a sovereign,
according to others.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She
had, in some sort, put on a mourning countenance beforehand, and
all the court wore it as she did.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis, in order not to
show on his face what was passing at the bottom of his heart,
persisted in remaining in his own apartments, where his nurse
alone kept him company; the more he saw the approach of the time
when all constraint would be at an end, the more humble and
patient he was, falling back upon himself, as all strong men do
when they form great designs, in order to gain more spring at the
decisive moment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Extreme
unction had been administered to the cardinal, who, faithful to
his habits of dissimulation, struggled against appearances, and
even against reality, receiving company in his bed, as if he only
suffered from a temporary complaint.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Gu&eacute;naud, on his
part, preserved profound secrecy; wearied with visits and
questions, he answered nothing but "his eminence is still full of
youth and strength, but God wills that which He wills, and when
He has decided that man is to be laid low, he will be laid
low."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> These words, which
he scattered with a sort of discretion, reserve, and preference,
were commented upon earnestly by two persons, - the king and the
cardinal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mazarin,
notwithstanding the prophecy of Gu&eacute;naud, still lured
himself with a hope, or rather played his part so well, that the
most cunning, when saying that he lured himself, proved that they
were his dupes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis, absent from the
cardinal for two days; Louis, with his eyes fixed upon that same
donation which so constantly preoccupied the cardinal; Louis did
not exactly know how to make out Mazarin's conduct.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The son of Louis XIII., following
the paternal traditions, had, up to that time, been so little of
a king that, whilst ardently desiring royalty, he desired it with
that terror which always accompanies the unknown.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Thus, having formed his resolution,
which, besides, he communicated to nobody, he determined to have
an interview with Mazarin.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was Anne of Austria, who,
constant in her attendance upon the cardinal, first heard this
proposition of the king's, and transmitted it to the dying man,
whom it greatly agitated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
For what purpose could Louis wish for an interview?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Was it to return the deed, as
Colbert had said he would?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Was it to keep it, after thanking
him, as Mazarin thought he would?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Nevertheless, as the dying man felt
that the uncertainty increased his torments, he did not hesitate
an instant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "His majesty will be
welcome, - yes, very welcome," cried he, making a sign to
Colbert, who was seated at the foot of the bed, and which the
latter understood perfectly.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Madame," continued Mazarin, "will
your majesty be good enough to assure the king yourself of the
truth of what I have just said?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Anne of Austria rose;
she herself was anxious to have the question of the forty
millions settled - the question which seemed to lie heavy on the
mind of everyone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Anne of
Austria went out; Mazarin made a great effort, and, raising
himself up towards Colbert: "Well, Colbert," said he, "two days
have passed away - two mortal days - and, you see, nothing has
been returned from yonder."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Patience, my lord,"
said Colbert.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Are you mad, you
wretch?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You advise me to
have patience!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh, in sad
truth, Colbert, you are laughing at me.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am dying and you call out to me to
wait!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My lord," said Colbert,
with his habitual coolness, "it is impossible that things should
not come out as I have said.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His majesty is coming to see you,
and no doubt he brings back the deed himself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do you think so?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well, I, on the contrary, am
sure that his majesty is coming to thank me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> At this moment Anne of
Austria returned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On her
way to the apartments of her son she had met with a new
empiric.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This was a
powder which was said to have power to save the cardinal; and she
brought a portion of this powder with her.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But this was not what Mazarin
expected; therefore he would not even look at it, declaring that
life was not worth the pains that were taken to preserve it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But, whilst professing this
philosophical axiom, his long-confined secret escaped him at
last.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That, madame," said he,
"that is not the interesting part of my situation.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I made, two days ago, a little
donation to the king; up to this time, from delicacy, no doubt,
his majesty has not condescended to say anything about it; but
the time for explanation is come, and I implore your majesty to
tell me if the king has made up his mind on that matter."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Anne of Austria was
about to reply, when Mazarin stopped her.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The truth, madame,"
said he - "in the name of Heaven, the truth!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do not flatter a dying man with a
hope that may prove vain."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There he stopped, a look from
Colbert telling him he was on the wrong track.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I know," said Anne of
Austria, taking the cardinal's hand, "I know that you have
generously made, not a little donation, as you modestly call it,
but a magnificent gift.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I
know how painful it would be to you if the king - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Mazarin listened, dying
as he was, as ten living men could not have listened.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "If the king - " replied
he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "If the king," continued
Anne of Austria, "should not freely accept what you offer so
nobly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Mazarin allowed himself
to sink back upon his pillow like Pantaloon; that is to say, with
all the despair of a man who bows before the tempest; but he
still preserved sufficient strength and presence of mind to cast
upon Colbert one of those looks which are well worth ten sonnets,
which is to say, ten long poems.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Should you not," added
the queen, "have considered the refusal of the king as a sort of
insult?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mazarin rolled
his head about upon his pillow, without articulating a
syllable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The queen was
deceived, or feigned to be deceived, by this demonstration.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Therefore," resumed
she, "I have circumvented him with good counsels; and as certain
minds, jealous, no doubt, of the glory you are about to acquire
by this generosity, have endeavored to prove to the king that he
ought not to accept this donation, I have struggled in your
favor, and so well I have struggled, that you will not have, I
hope, that distress to undergo."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!" murmured Mazarin,
with languishing eyes, "ah! that is a service I shall never
forget for a single minute of the few hours I still have to
live."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I must admit,"
continued the queen, "that it was not without trouble I rendered
it to your eminence."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah, <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>peste!</i><span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I believe that.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh! oh!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Good God! what is the
matter?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do you suffer
much?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "As much as one of the
damned."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Colbert would have liked
to sink through the floor.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "So, then," resumed
Mazarin, "your majesty thinks that the king - " he stopped
several seconds - "that the king is coming here to offer me some
small thanks?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I think so," said
queen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mazarin
annihilated Colbert with his last look.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> At that moment the
ushers announced that the king was in the ante-chambers, which
were filled with people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
This announcement produced a stir of which Colbert took advantage
to escape by the door of the <i style=

"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Anne of Austria arose, and awaited
her son, standing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis
XIV. appeared at the threshold of the door, with his eyes fixed
upon the dying man, who did not even think it worth while to
notice that majesty from whom he thought he had nothing more to
expect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> An usher placed
an armchair close to the bed.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis bowed to his mother, then to
the cardinal, and sat down.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The queen took a seat in her
turn.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Then, as the king looked
behind him, the usher understood that look, and made a sign to
the courtiers who filled up the doorway to go out, which they
instantly did.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Silence
fell upon the chamber with the velvet curtains.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king, still very young, and very
timid in the presence of him who had been his master from his
birth, still respected him much, particularly now, in the supreme
majesty of death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He did
not dare, therefore, to begin the conversation, feeling that
every word must have its weight not only upon things of this
world, but of the next.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
As to the cardinal, at that moment he had but one thought - his
donation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was not
physical pain which gave him that air of despondency, and that
lugubrious look; it was the expectation of the thanks that were
about to issue from the king's mouth, and cut off all hope of
restitution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mazarin was
the first to break the silence.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Is your majesty come to make any
stay at Vincennes?" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis made an
affirmative sign with his head.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is a gracious
favor," continued Mazarin, "granted to a dying man, and which
will render death less painful to him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I hope," replied the
king, "I am come to visit, not a dying man, but a sick man,
susceptible of cure."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Mazarin replied by a
movement of the head.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your majesty is very
kind; but I know more than you on that subject.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The last visit, sire," said he, "the
last visit."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "If it were so, monsieur
le cardinal," said Louis, "I would come a last time to ask the
counsels of a guide to whom I owe everything."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Anne of Austria was a
woman; she could not restrain her tears.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis showed himself much affected,
and Mazarin still more than his two guests, but from very
different motives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Here
the silence returned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
queen wiped her eyes, and the king resumed his firmness.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I was saying,"
continued the king, "that I owed much to your eminence."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The eyes of the cardinal had
devoured the king, for he felt the great moment had come.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "And," continued Louis, "the
principal object of my visit was to offer you very sincere thanks
for the last evidence of friendship you have kindly sent me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The cheeks of the
cardinal became sunken, his lips partially opened, and the most
lamentable sigh he had ever uttered was about to issue from his
chest.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire," said he, "I
shall have despoiled my poor family; I shall have ruined all who
belong to me, which may be imputed to me as an error; but, at
least, it shall not be said of me that I have refused to
sacrifice everything to my king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Anne of Austria's tears
flowed afresh.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My dear Monsieur
Mazarin," said the king, in a more serious tone than might have
been expected from his youth, "you have misunderstood me,
apparently."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Mazarin raised himself
upon his elbow.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I have no purpose to
despoil your dear family, nor to ruin your servants.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh, no, that must never be!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Humph!" thought
Mazarin, "he is going to restore me some scraps; let us get the
largest piece we can."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The king is going to be
foolishly affected and play generous," thought the queen; "he
must not be allowed to impoverish himself; such an opportunity
for getting a fortune will never occur again."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire," said the
cardinal, aloud, "my family is very numerous, and my nieces will
be destitute when I am gone."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh," interrupted the
queen, eagerly, "have no uneasiness with respect to your family,
dear Monsieur Mazarin; we have no friends dearer than your
friends; your nieces shall be my children, the sisters of his
majesty; and if a favor be distributed in France, it shall be to
those you love."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Smoke!" thought
Mazarin, who knew better than any one the faith that can be put
in the promises of kings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Louis read the dying man's thought in his face.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Be comforted, my dear
Monsieur Mazarin," said he, with a half-smile, sad beneath its
irony; "the Mesdemoiselles de Mancini will lose, in losing you,
their most precious good; but they shall none the less be the
richest heiresses of France; and since you have been kind enough
to give me their dowry" - the cardinal was panting - "I restore
it to them," continued Louis, drawing from his breast and holding
towards the cardinal's bed the parchment which contained the
donation that, during two days, had kept alive such tempests in
the mind of Mazarin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What did I tell you, my
lord?" murmured in the alcove a voice which passed away like a
breath.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your majesty returns my
donation!" cried Mazarin, so disturbed by joy as to forget his
character of a benefactor.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your majesty rejects
the forty millions!" cried Anne of Austria, so stupefied as to
forget her character of an afflicted wife, or queen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, my lord cardinal;
yes, madame," replied Louis XIV., tearing the parchment which
Mazarin had not yet ventured to clutch; "yes, I annihilate this
deed, which despoiled a whole family.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The wealth acquired by his eminence
in my service is his own wealth and not mine."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But, sire, does your
majesty reflect," said Anne of Austria, "that you have not ten
thousand crowns in your coffers?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Madame, I have just
performed my first royal action, and I hope it will worthily
inaugurate my reign."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! sire, you are
right!" cried Mazarin; "that is truly great - that is truly
generous which you have just done."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he looked, one after the other,
at the pieces of the act spread over his bed, to assure himself
that it was the original and not a copy that had been torn.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At length his eyes fell upon
the fragment which bore his signature, and recognizing it, he
sunk back on his bolster in a swoon.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Anne of Austria, without strength to
conceal her regret, raised her hands and eyes towards heaven.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! sire," cried
Mazarin, "may you be blessed!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> My God!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> May you be beloved by all my
family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Per Baccho!</i><span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If ever any of those belonging to me
should cause your displeasure, sire, only frown, and I will rise
from my tomb!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>pantalonnade</i> did not produce all
the effect Mazarin had counted upon.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis had already passed to
considerations of a higher nature, and as to Anne of Austria,
unable to bear, without abandoning herself to the anger she felt
burning within her, the magnanimity of her son and the hypocrisy
of the cardinal, she arose and left the chamber, heedless of thus
betraying the extent of her grief.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mazarin saw all this, and fearing
that Louis XIV. might repent his decision, in order to draw
attention another way he began to cry out, as, at a later period,
Scapin was to cry out, in that sublime piece of pleasantry with
which the morose and grumbling Boileau dared to reproach
Moli&egrave;re.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His
cries, however, by degrees, became fainter; and when Anne of
Austria left the apartment, they ceased altogether.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur le cardinal,"
said the king, "have you any recommendations to make me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire," replied Mazarin,
"you are already wisdom itself, prudence personified; of your
generosity I shall not venture to speak; that which you have just
done exceeds all that the most generous men of antiquity or of
modern times have ever done."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king received this
praise coldly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "So you confine
yourself," said he, "to your thanks - and your experience, much
more extensive than my wisdom, my prudence, or my generosity,
does not furnish you with a single piece of friendly advice to
guide my future."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mazarin
reflected for a moment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"You have just done much for me, sire," said he, "that is, for my
family."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Say no more about
that," said the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well!" continued
Mazarin, "I shall give you something in exchange for these forty
millions you have refused so royally."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis XIV. indicated by
a movement that these flatteries were displeasing to him.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I shall give you a piece of
advice," continued Mazarin; "yes, a piece of advice - advice more
precious than the forty millions."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My lord cardinal!"
interrupted Louis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, listen to this
advice."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am listening."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Come nearer, sire, for
I am weak! - nearer, sire, nearer!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king bent over the
dying man.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Sire," said
Mazarin, in so low a tone that the breath of his words arrived
only like a recommendation from the tomb in the attentive ears of
the king - "Sire, never have a prime minister."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis drew back
astonished.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The advice
was a confession - a treasure, in fact, was that sincere
confession of Mazarin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The legacy of the cardinal to the young king was composed of six
words only, but those six words, as Mazarin had said, were worth
forty millions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis
remained for an instant bewildered.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As for Mazarin, he appeared only to
have said something quite natural.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A little scratching was heard along
the curtains of the alcove.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mazarin understood: "Yes, yes!"
cried he, warmly, "yes, sire, I recommend to you a wise man, an
honest man, and a clever man."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Tell me his name, my
lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "His name is yet almost
unknown, sire; it is M. Colbert, my attendant.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh! try him," added Mazarin, in an
earnest voice; "all that he has predicted has come to pass; he
has a safe glance, he is never mistaken either in things or in
men - which is more surprising still.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Sire, I owe you much, but I think I
acquit myself of all towards you in giving you M. Colbert."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "So be it," said Louis,
faintly, for, as Mazarin had said, the name of Colbert was quite
unknown to him, and he thought the enthusiasm of the cardinal
partook of the delirium of a dying man.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The cardinal sank back on his
pillows.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "For the present, adieu,
sire! adieu," murmured Mazarin.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I am tired, and I have yet a rough
journey to take before I present myself to my new Master.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Adieu, sire!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The young king felt the
tears rise to his eyes; he bent over the dying man, already half
a corpse, and then hastily retired.</p>

T</span>he whole night was passed in anguish, common to the dying
man and to the king: the dying man expected his deliverance, the
king awaited his liberty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Louis did not go to bed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
An hour after leaving the chamber of the cardinal, he learned
that the dying man, recovering a little strength, had insisted
upon being dressed, adorned and painted, and seeing the
ambassadors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Like
Augustus, he no doubt considered the world a great stage, and was
desirous of playing out the last act of the comedy.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Anne of Austria reappeared no more
in the cardinal's apartments; she had nothing more to do
there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Propriety was the
pretext for her absence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
On his part, the cardinal did not ask for her: the advice the
queen had giver her son rankled in his heart.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Towards midnight, while
still painted, Mazarin's mortal agony came on.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had revised his will, and as this
will was the exact expression of his wishes, and as he feared
that some interested influence might take advantage of his
weakness to make him change something in it, he had given orders
to Colbert, who walked up and down the corridor which led to the
cardinal's bed-chamber, like the most vigilant of sentinels.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king, shut up in his own
apartment, dispatched his nurse every hour to Mazarin's chamber,
with orders to bring him back an exact bulletin of the cardinal's
state.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> After having heard
that Mazarin was dressed, painted, and had seen the ambassadors,
Louis herd that the prayers for the dying were being read for the
cardinal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At one o'clock
in the morning, Gu&eacute;naud had administered the last
remedy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This was a relic
of the old customs of that fencing time, which was about to
disappear to give place to another time, to believe that death
could be kept off by some good secret thrust.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mazarin, after having taken the
remedy, respired freely for nearly ten minutes.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He immediately gave orders that the
news should be spread everywhere of a fortunate crisis.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king, on learning this,
felt as if a cold sweat were passing over his brow; - he had had
a glimpse of the light of liberty; slavery appeared to him more
dark and less acceptable than ever.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But the bulletin which followed
entirely changed the face of things.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mazarin could no longer breathe at
all, and could scarcely follow the prayers which the cur&eacute;
of Saint-Nicholas-des-Champs recited near him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king resumed his agitated walk
about his chamber, and consulted, as he walked, several papers
drawn from a casket of which he alone had the key.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A third time the nurse
returned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M. de Mazarin
had just uttered a joke, and had ordered his "Flora," by Titian,
to be revarnished.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At
length, towards two o'clock in the morning, the king could no
longer resist his weariness: he had not slept for twenty-four
hours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Sleep, so powerful
at his age, overcame him for about an hour.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But he did not go to bed for that
hour; he slept in a <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>fauteuil</i>.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> About four o'clock his nurse awoke
him by entering the room.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

king.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "And what is become

opened it himself, and perceived Colbert standing waiting in the

remained modestly standing near that door.</p>

"Are you, then, M. Colbert?" asked he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

I who had the honor of giving monsieur le cardinal the idea of an
economy which puts three hundred thousand francs a year into your
majesty's coffers."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What economy was that,
monsieur?" asked Louis XIV.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

the hundred Swiss have silver lace on each side of their
ribbons?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, sire, it was I
who proposed that imitation silver lace should be placed upon
these ribbons; it could not be detected, and a hundred thousand
crowns serve to feed a regiment during six months; and is the
price of ten thousand good muskets or the value of a vessel of
ten guns, ready for sea."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is true," said
Louis XIV., considering more attentively, "and, <i style=

economy; besides, it was ridiculous for soldiers to wear the same
lace as noblemen."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

approved of by your majesty."</p>

appointed to examine the accounts of the superintendent,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!" said Louis, who
was about to dismiss Colbert, but whom that word stopped; "ah! it
was you whom his eminence had charged to control M. Fouquet, was
it?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And the result of
that examination?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

it is you who have controlled these accounts; give me the
result."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

done, sire: emptiness everywhere, money nowhere."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Beware, monsieur; you
are roughly attacking the administration of M. Fouquet, who,
nevertheless, I have heard say, is an able man."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Colbert colored, and
then became pale, for he felt that from that minute he entered
upon a struggle with a man whose power almost equaled the sway of
him who had just died.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Yes, sire, a very able man," repeated Colbert, bowing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But if M. Fouquet is an
able man, and, in spite of that ability, if money be wanting,
whose fault is it?"</p>

I verify."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

your accounts, and present them to me.<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Monsieur Colbert?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

them resign.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Further,
upon each agreement M. Fouquet has made an abatement of a third,

profiting by it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The king

superintendent would not find me any money?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

head.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

no longer any revenue?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king frowned and
said, "If it be so, I will get together the <i style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

ruined before I begin to reign."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

monsieur, the money is somewhere?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

a beginning, I bring your majesty a note of funds which M. le

neither in any act whatever, but which he confided to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

a hundred millions perhaps between them!<span style=

without stirring.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In the cellar of a

so kind as to leave me by a particular clause of his will."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are acquainted with
the cardinal's will, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, sire, and here it
is."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Colbert drew the
deed quietly from his pocket, and showed it to the king.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king read the article
relative to the donation of the house.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But," said he, "there
is no question here but of the house; there is nothing said of
the money."</p>

is in my conscience."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

of everybody?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

sire, as your majesty may perceive."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis fixed his eyes
with admiration upon that vulgar but expressive face.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "You are an honest man, M. Colbert,"
said the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is not a virtue,
it is a duty," replied Colbert, coolly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But," added Louis,
"does not the money belong to the family?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "If this money belonged
to the family it would be disposed of in the testament, as the
rest of the fortune is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
If this money belonged to the family, I, who drew up the deed of
donation in favor of your majesty, should have added the sum of
thirteen millions to that of forty millions which was offered to
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "How!" exclaimed Louis
XIV., "was it you who drew up the deed of donation?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And yet the cardinal
was attached to you?" added the king, ingenuously.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I had assured his
eminence you would by no means accept the gift," said Colbert, in
that same quiet manner we have described, and which, even in the
common habits of life, had something solemn in it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis passed his hand
over his brow: "Oh! how young I am," murmured he, "to have
command of men."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Colbert waited the end
of this monologue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He saw
Louis raise his head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "At
what hour shall I send the money to your majesty?" asked he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To-night, at eleven
o'clock; I desire that no one may know that I possess this
money."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Colbert made no more
reply than if the thing had not been said to him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

ingots, or coined gold?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "This must be a dream!"<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then he allowed his head to sink
between his hands, as if he were really asleep.<span style=

arose, and opening the window violently, he bathed his burning
brow in the keen morning air, which brought to his senses the

I</span>n the morning, the news of the death of the cardinal was
spread through the castle, and thence speedily reached the
city.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The ministers
Fouquet, Lyonne, and Letellier entered <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>la salle des s&eacute;ances</i>, to
hold a council.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king
sent for them immediately.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Messieurs," said he," as long as
monsieur le cardinal lived, I allowed him to govern my affairs;
but now I mean to govern them myself.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You will give me your advice when I
ask it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You may go."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The ministers looked at
each other with surprise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
If they concealed a smile it was with a great effort, for they
knew that the prince, brought up in absolute ignorance of
business, by this took upon himself a burden much too heavy for
his strength.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fouquet
took leave of his colleagues upon the stairs, saying: -
"Messieurs! there will be so much the less labor for us."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And he climbed gayly
into his carriage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
others, a little uneasy at the turn things had taken, went back
to Paris together.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Towards ten o'clock the king repaired to the apartment of his
mother, with whom he had a long and private conversation.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> After dinner, he got into his
carriage, and went straight to the Louvre.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There he received much company, and
took a degree of pleasure in remarking the hesitation of each,
and the curiosity of all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Towards evening he ordered the doors of the Louvre to be closed,
with the exception of only one, which opened on the quay.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He placed on duty at this
point two hundred Swiss, who did not speak a word of French, with
orders to admit all who carried packages, but no others; and by
no means to allow any one to go out.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At eleven o'clock precisely, he
heard the rolling of a heavy carriage under the arch, then of
another, then of a third; after which the gate grated upon its
hinges to be closed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Soon
after, somebody scratched with his nail at the door of the
cabinet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king opened
it himself, and beheld Colbert, whose first word was this: - "The
money is in your majesty's cellar."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king then descended
and went himself to see the barrels of specie, in gold and
silver, which, under the direction of Colbert, four men had just
rolled into a cellar of which the king had given Colbert the key
in the morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This
review completed, Louis returned to his apartments, followed by
Colbert, who had not apparently warmed with one ray of personal
satisfaction.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

T</span>he day of his arrival, on returning from the Palais
Royal, Athos, as we have seen, went straight to his hotel in the
Rue Saint-Honor&eacute;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
He there found the Vicomte de Bragelonne waiting for him in his
chamber, chatting with Grimaud.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was not an easy thing to talk
with this old servant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Two men only possessed the secret, Athos and D'Artagnan.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The first succeeded, because
Grimaud sought to make him speak himself; D'Artagnan, on the
contrary, because he knew how to make Grimaud talk.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Raoul was occupied in making him
describe the voyage to England, and Grimaud had related it in all
its details, with a limited number of gestures and eight words,
neither more nor less. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
He had, at first, indicated by an undulating movement of his
hand, that his master and he had crossed the sea.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Upon some expedition?" Raoul had
asked.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Grimaud by bending down
his head had answered, "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

incurred much danger?" asked Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Neither too much nor
too little," was replied by a shrug of the shoulders.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But still, what sort of
danger?" insisted Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Grimaud pointed to the
sword; he pointed to the fire and to a musket that was hanging on
the wall.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur le comte had
an enemy there, then?" cried Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monk," replied
Grimaud.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is strange,"
continued Raoul, "that monsieur le comte persists in considering
me a novice, and not allowing me to partake the honor and danger
of his adventure."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Grimaud smiled. <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was at this moment Athos
came in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The host was
lighting him up the stairs, and Grimaud, recognizing the step of
his master, hastened to meet him, which cut short the
conversation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But Raoul
was launched on the sea of interrogatories, and did not
stop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Taking both hands
of the comte, with warm, but respectful tenderness, - "How is it,
monsieur," said he, "that you have set out upon a dangerous
voyage without bidding me adieu, without commanding the aid of my
sword, of myself, who ought to be your support, now I have the
strength; whom you have brought up like a man?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Ah! monsieur, can you expose me to
the cruel trial of never seeing you again?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Who told you, Raoul,"
said the comte, placing his cloak and hat in the hands of
Grimaud, who had unbuckled his sword, "who told you that my
voyage was a dangerous one?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I," said Grimaud.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And why did you do so?"
said Athos, sternly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Grimaud was embarrassed;
Raoul came to his assistance, by answering for him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "It is natural, monsieur, that our
good Grimaud should tell me the truth in what concerns you.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> By whom should you be loved an
supported, if not by me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Athos did not
reply.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He made a friendly
motion to Grimaud, which sent him out of the room; he then seated
himself in a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>fauteuil</i>,
whilst Raoul remained standing before him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But it is true,"
continued Raoul, "that your voyage was an expedition, and that
steel and fire threatened you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Say no more about that,
vicomte," said Athos, mildly.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I set out hastily, it is true: but
the service of King Charles II. required a prompt departure.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As to your anxiety, I thank
you for it, and I know that I can depend on you.<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

to take the stakes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

hoped.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He only met with
Planchet, whose joy was great at seeing the young man again, and
who contrived to pay him two or three little soldierly
compliments, savoring very little of the grocer's shop.<span

next day from Vincennes at the head of fifty dragoons confided to
him by Monsieur le Prince, he perceived, in La Place Baudoyer, a
man with his nose in the air, examining a house as we examine a
horse we have a fancy to buy.<span style=

costume buttoned up like a military <i style=

his head, but a long shagreen-mounted sword by his side, turned
his head as soon as he heard the steps of the horses, and left
off looking at the house to look at the dragoons.<span style=

D'Artagnan on foot; D'Artagnan with his hands behind him, passing
a little review upon the dragoons, after having reviewed the
buildings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Not a man, not
a tag, not a horse's hoof escaped his inspection.<span style=

Raoul," said D'Artagnan, "the second horse of the fifth rank will
lose a shoe before he gets to the Pont Marie; he has only two
nails left in his off fore-foot."</p>

notice to the cornet, who took his post; he then dismounted, gave
his horse to one of the dragoons, and with great delight seized

little evolutions with the satisfaction of a connoisseur.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

my last word."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

and the fourth to your father."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> That being said,
D'Artagnan took his belt from the hook, girded on his sword, took
a hat the feather of which was fresh, and held his hand out to
Raoul, who threw himself into his arms.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When in the shop, he cast a quick
glance at the shop-lads, who looked upon the scene with a pride
mingled with some inquietude; then plunging his hands into a
chest of currants, he went straight to the officer who was
waiting for him at the door.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Those features!<span

friends?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

lads among themselves.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ja, it is I, Monsieur
d'Artagnan!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Good-day to
you!" said the Swiss, in his mountain <i style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Must I give you up my
sword?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I warn you that it
is long and heavy; you had better let me wear if to the Louvre: I
feel quite lost in the streets without a sword, and you would be
more at a loss that I should, with two."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The king has given me
no orders about it," replied the Swiss, "so keep your sword."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, that is very
polite on the part of the king.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Let us go, at once."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monsieur Friedisch was
not a talker, and D'Artagnan had too many things to think about
to say much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> From
Planchet's shop to the Louvre was not far, - they arrived in ten
minutes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was a dark
night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M. de Friedisch
wanted to enter by the wicket.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "No," said D'Artagnan, "you would
lose time by that; take the little staircase."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The Swiss did as
D'Artagnan advised, and conducted him to the vestibule of the
king's cabinet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When
arrived there, he bowed to his prisoner, and, without saying
anything, returned to his post.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan had not had time to ask
why his sword was not taken from him, when the door of the
cabinet opened, and a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>valet
de chambre</i> called, "M. d'Artagnan!" <span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The musketeer assumed his parade
carriage, and entered, with his large eyes wide open, his brow
calm, his moustache stiff.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king was seated at a table
writing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He did not
disturb himself when the step of the musketeer resounded on the
floor; he did not even turn his head.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan advanced as far as the
middle of the room, and seeing that the king paid no attention to
him, and suspecting, besides, that this was nothing but
affectation, a sort of tormenting preamble to the explanation
that was preparing, he turned his back on the prince, and began
to examine the frescoes on the cornices, and the cracks in the
ceiling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This maneuver
was accompanied by a little tacit monologue.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Ah! you want to humble me, do you?
- you, whom I have seen so young - you, whom I have saved as I
would my own child, - you, whom I have served as I would a God -
that is to say, for nothing.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Wait awhile! wait awhile! you shall
see what a man can do who has suffered the air of the fire of the
Huguenots, under the beard of monsieur le cardinal - the true
cardinal."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At this moment
Louis turned round.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! are you there,
Monsieur d'Artagnan?" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan saw the
movement and imitated it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Yes, sire," said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very well; have the
goodness to wait till I have cast this up."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan made no
reply; he only bowed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"That is polite enough," thought he; "I have nothing to say."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis made a violent
dash with his pen, and threw it angrily away.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! go on, work
yourself up!" thought the musketeer; "you will put me at my
ease.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You shall find I
did not empty the bag, the other day, at Blois."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis rose from his
seat, passed his hand over his brow, then, stopping opposite to
D'Artagnan, he looked at him with an air at once imperious and
kind,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "What the devil
does he want with me?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I
wish he would begin!" thought the musketeer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur," said the
king, "you know, without doubt, that monsieur le cardinal is
dead?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I suspected so,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You know that,
consequently, I am master in my own kingdom?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is not a thing
that dates from the death of monsieur le cardinal, sire; a man is
always master in his own house, when he wishes to be so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes; but do you not
remember all you said to me at Blois?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Now we come to it,"
thought D'Artagnan; "I was not deceived.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well, so much the better, it is a
sign that my scent is tolerably keen yet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You do not answer me,"
said Louis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, I think I
recollect."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You only think?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is so long ago."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "If you do not remember,
I do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You said to me, -
listen with attention."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! I shall listen with
all my ears, sire; for it is very likely the conversation will
turn in a fashion very interesting to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis once more looked
at the musketeer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
latter smoothed the feather of his hat, then his mustache, and
waited bravely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis
XIV. continued: "You quitted my service, monsieur, after having
told me the whole truth?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is, after having
declared to me all you thought to be true, with regard to my mode
of thinking and acting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
That is always a merit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
You began by telling me that you had served my family thirty
years, and were fatigued."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I said so; yes,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And you afterwards
admitted that that fatigue was a pretext, and that discontent was
the real cause."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I was discontented, in
fact; but that discontent has never betrayed itself, that I know
of, and if, like a man of heart, I have spoken out before your
majesty, I have not even thought of the matter before anybody
else."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do not excuse yourself,
D'Artagnan, but continue to listen to me.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When making me the reproach that you
were discontented, you received in reply a promise: - 'Wait.' -
Is that not true?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, sire, as true as
what I told you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You answered me,
'Hereafter!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No, now,
immediately.'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do not
excuse yourself, I tell you. <span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was natural, but you had no
charity for your poor prince, Monsieur d'Artagnan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

king, on the part of a poor soldier!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You understand me very
well; you knew that I stood in need of it; you knew very well
that I was not master; you knew very well that my hope was in the
future.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now, you answered
me when I spoke of the future, 'My discharge, - and that
directly.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is true," murmured
D'Artagnan, biting his mustache.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You did not flatter me
when I was in distress," added Louis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But," said D'Artagnan,
raising his head nobly, "if I did not flatter your majesty when
poor, neither did I betray you.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have shed my blood for nothing; I
have watched like a dog at a door, knowing full well that neither
bread nor bone would be thrown to me.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I, although poor likewise, asked
nothing of your majesty but the discharge you speak of."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

man, but I was a young man, and you ought to have had some
indulgence for me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What
had you to reproach the king with? - that he left King Charles
II. without assistance? - let us say further - that he did not
marry Mademoiselle de Mancini?"<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When saying these words, the king
fixed upon the musketeer a searching look.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

latter, "he is doing far more than remembering, he divines.<span

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your sentence,"
continued Louis, "fell upon the king and fell upon the man.<span

weakness, for you considered it a weakness?" - D'Artagnan made no
reply - "you reproached me also with regard to monsieur, the
defunct cardinal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now,
monsieur le cardinal, did he not bring me up, did he not support
me? - elevating himself and supporting himself at the same time,
I admit; but the benefit was discharged.<span style=

you, then, have better loved or served me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

forward his purpose.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

reflected?" resumed Louis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

D'Artagnan, politely.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is a handsome

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

remaining idle?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Impossible, Monsieur

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Because it is <i style=

the young prince, in a voice so stern and imperious that
D'Artagnan evinced surprise and even uneasiness.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Will your majesty allow
me one word of reply?" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I formed that

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Now, when by my energy
I have acquired a comfortable means of subsistence, would your
majesty despoil me of my liberty?<span style=

lowest, when I have gained the highest?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Who gave you
permission, monsieur, to fathom my designs, or to reckon with
me?" replied Louis, in a voice almost angry; "who told you what I
shall do or what you will yourself do?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire," said the
musketeer, quietly, "as far as I see, freedom is not the order of
the conversation, as it was on the day we came to an explanation
at Blois."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, monsieur;
everything is changed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I tender your majesty
my sincere compliments upon that, but - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But you don't believe
it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am not a great
statesman, and yet I have my eye upon affairs; it seldom fails;
now, I do not see exactly as your majesty does, sire.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The reign of Mazarin is over, but
that of the financiers is begun.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They have the money; your majesty
will not often see much of it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To live under the paw of these
hungry wolves is hard for a man who reckoned upon
independence."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> At this moment someone
scratched at the door of the cabinet; the king raised his head
proudly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Your pardon,
Monsieur d'Artagnan," said he; "it is M. Colbert, who comes to
make me a report.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Come
in, M. Colbert."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan drew
back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Colbert entered
with papers in his hand, and went up to the king.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There can be little doubt that the
Gascon did not lose the opportunity of applying his keen, quick
glance to the new figure which presented itself.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Is the inquiry
made?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And the opinion of the
inquisitors?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Is that the accused
merit confiscation and death."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! ah!" said the king,
without changing countenance, and casting an oblique look at
D'Artagnan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "And your own
opinion, M. Colbert?" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Colbert looked at
D'Artagnan is his turn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
That imposing countenance checked the words upon his lips.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis perceived this.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Do not disturb yourself,"
said he; "it is M. d'Artagnan, - do you not know M. d'Artagnan
again?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> These two men looked at
each other - D'Artagnan, with eyes open and bright as the day -
Colbert, with his half closed, and dim.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The frank intrepidity of the
financier annoyed the other; the circumspection of the financier
disgusted the soldier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Ah! ah! this is the gentleman who made that brilliant stroke in
England," said Colbert.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
And he bowed slightly to D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! ah!" said the
Gascon, "this is the gentleman who clipped off the lace from the
uniform of the Swiss!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A
praiseworthy piece of economy."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The financier thought to
pierce the musketeer; but the musketeer ran the financier
through.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur d'Artagnan,"
resumed the king, who had not remarked all the shades of which
Mazarin would have missed not one, "this concerns the farmers of
the revenue who have robbed me, whom I am hanging, and whose
death-warrants I am about to sign."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! oh!" said
D'Artagnan, starting.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What did you say?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! nothing, sire.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This is no business of
mine."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king had already
taken up the pen, and was applying it to the paper.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Sire," said Colbert in a subdued
voice, "I beg to warn your majesty, that if an example be
necessary, there will be difficulty in the execution of your
orders."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What do you say?" said
Louis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You must not conceal
from yourself," continued Colbert quietly, "that attacking the
farmers-general is attacking the superintendence.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The two unfortunate guilty men in
question are the particular friends of a powerful personage, and
the punishment, which otherwise might be comfortably confined to
the Ch&acirc;tlet, will doubtless be a signal for
disturbances!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis colored and turned
towards D'Artagnan, who took a slight bite at his mustache, not
without a smile of pity for the financier, and for the king who
had to listen to him so long.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But Louis seized the pen, and with a
movement so rapid that his hand shook, he affixed his signature
at the bottom of the two papers presented by Colbert, - then
looking the latter in the face, - "Monsieur Colbert," said he,
"when you speak to me on business, exclude more frequently the
word difficulty from your reasonings and opinions; as to the word
impossibility, never pronounce it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Colbert bowed, much
humiliated at having to undergo such a lesson before the
musketeer; he was about to go out, but, jealous to repair his
check: "I forgot to announce to your majesty," said he, "that the
confiscations amount to the sum of five millions of livres."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That's pretty well!"
thought D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Which makes in my
coffers?" said the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Eighteen millions of
livres, sire," replied Colbert, bowing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mordioux!</i>" growled D'Artagnan,
"that's glorious!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur Colbert,"
added the king, "you will, if you please, go through the gallery
where M. Lyonne is waiting, and will tell him to bring hither
what he has drawn up - by my order."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Directly, sire; if your
majesty wants me no more this evening?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, monsieur:
good-night!"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And Colbert
went out.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Now, let us return to
our affair, M. d'Artagnan," said the king, as if nothing had
happened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "You see that,
with respect to money, there is already a notable change."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Something to the tune
of from zero to eighteen millions," replied the musketeer
gayly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Ah! that was what
your majesty wanted the day King Charles II. came to Blois.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The two states would not have
been embroiled to-day; for I <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>must</i> say, that there also I see
another stumbling-block."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, in the first
place," replied Louis, "you are unjust, monsieur; for, if
Providence had made me able to give my brother the million that
day, you would not have quitted my service, and, consequently,
you would not have made your fortune, as you told me just now you
have done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But, in
addition to this, I have had another piece of good fortune; and
my difference with Great Britain need not alarm you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> A <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>valet de chambre</i> interrupted the
king by announcing M. Lyonne.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Come in, monsieur," said the king;
"you are punctual; that is like a good servant.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Let us see your letter to my brother
Charles II."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan pricked up
his ears.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "A moment,
monsieur," said Louis carelessly to the Gascon; "I must expedite
to London my consent to the marriage of my brother, M. le Duc
d'Anjou, with the Princess Henrietta Stuart."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He is knocking me
about, it seems," murmured D'Artagnan, whilst the king signed the
letter, and dismissed M. de Lyonne; "but <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>ma foi!</i> the more he knocks me
about in this manner, the better I like it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king followed M. de
Lyonne with his eyes, till the door was closed behind him; he
even made three steps, as if he would follow the minister; but,
after these three steps, stopping, passing, and coming back to
the musketeer, - "Now, monsieur," said he, "let us hasten to
terminate our affair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You
told me the other day, at Blois, that you were not rich?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But I am now,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, but that does not
concern me; you have your own money, not mine; <i style=

account."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I do not well
understand what your majesty means."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Then, instead of
leaving you to draw out words, speak spontaneously.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Should you be satisfied with twenty
thousand livres a year as a fixed income?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But, sire" said
D'Artagnan, opening his eyes to the utmost.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Would you be satisfied
with four horses furnished and kept, and with a supplement of
funds such as you might require, according to occasions and
needs, or would you prefer a fixed sum which would be, for
example, forty thousand livres?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Answer."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

to reckon the extra expenses separately; you can arrange that
with Colbert.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now let us
pass to something more important."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But, sire, I told your
majesty - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That you wanted rest, I

have to confide to you, on that day you may yourself take the

down his head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Come,
monsieur," said the king, "one would believe, to look at you,
that you did not know that at the court of the most Christian

W</span>hilst D'Artagnan was returning to Planchet's house, his
head aching and bewildered with all that had happened to him,
there was passing a scene of quite a different character, and
which, nevertheless, is not foreign to the conversation our
musketeer had just had with the king; only this scene took place
out of Paris, in a house possessed by the superintendent Fouquet
in the village of Saint-Mand&eacute;.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The minister had just arrived at
this country-house, followed by his principal clerk, who carried
an enormous portfolio full of papers to be examined, and others
waiting for signature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As
it might be about five o'clock in the afternoon, the masters had
dined: supper was being prepared for twenty subaltern
guests.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
superintendent did not stop: on alighting from his carriage, he,
at the same bound, sprang through the doorway, traversed the
apartments and gained his cabinet, where he declared he would
shut himself up to work, commanding that he should not be
disturbed for anything but an order from the king.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As soon as this order was given,
Fouquet shut himself up, and two footmen were placed as sentinels
at his door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then Fouquet
pushed a bolt which displaced a panel that walled up the
entrance, and prevented everything that passed in this apartment
from being either seen or heard.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But, against all probability, it was
only for the sake of shutting himself up that Fouquet shut
himself up thus, for he went straight to a bureau, seated himself
at it, opened the portfolio, and began to make a choice amongst
the enormous mass of papers it contained.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was not more than ten minutes
after he had entered, and taken all the precautions we have
described, when the repeated noise of several slight equal knocks
struck his ear, and appeared to fix his utmost attention.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fouquet raised his head,
turned his ear, and listened.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The strokes
continued.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then the
worker arose with a slight movement of impatience and walked
straight up to a glass behind which the blows were struck by a
hand, or by some invisible mechanism.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was a large glass let into a
panel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Three other
glasses, exactly similar to it, completed the symmetry of the
apartment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Nothing
distinguished that one from the others.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Without doubt, these reiterated
knocks were a signal; for, at the moment Fouquet approached the
glass listening, the same noise was renewed, and in the same
measure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Oh! oh!"
murmured the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>intendant</i>,
with surprise, "who is yonder?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I did not expect anybody
to-day."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And without
doubt, to respond to the signal, he pulled out a gilded nail near
the glass, and shook it thrice.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then returning to his place, and
seating himself again, "<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ma
foi!</i> let them wait," said he.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And plunging again into the ocean of
papers unrolled before him, he appeared to think of nothing now
but work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In fact, with
incredible rapidity and marvelous lucidity, Fouquet deciphered
the largest papers and most complicated writings, correcting
them, annotating them with a pen moved as if by a fever, and the
work melting under his hands, signatures, figures, references,
became multiplied as if ten clerks - that is to say, a hundred
fingers and ten brains had performed the duties, instead of the
five fingers and single brain of this man.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> From time to time, only, Fouquet,
absorbed by his work, raised his head to cast a furtive glance
upon a clock placed before him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The reason of this was, Fouquet set
himself a task, and when this task was once set, in one hour's
work he, by himself, did what another would not have accomplished
in a day; always certain, consequently, provided he was not
disturbed, of arriving at the close in the time his devouring
activity had fixed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But
in the midst of his ardent labor, the soft strokes upon the
little bell placed behind the glass sounded again, hasty, and,
consequently, more urgent.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The lady appears to be
impatient," said Fouquet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Humph! a calm!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That must
be the comtesse; but, no, the comtesse is gone to Rambouillet for
three days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
pr&eacute;sidente, then?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Oh! no, the pr&eacute;sidente would not assume such grand airs;
she would ring very humbly, then she would wait my good
pleasure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The greatest
certainty is, that I do not know who it can be, but that I know
who it cannot be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And
since it is not you, marquise, since it cannot be you, deuce take
the rest!"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he went on
with his work in spite of the reiterated appeals of the
bell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the end of a
quarter of an hour, however, impatience prevailed over Fouquet in
his turn: he might be said to consume, rather than to complete
the rest of his work; he thrust his papers into his portfolio,
and giving a glance at the mirror, whilst the taps continued
faster than ever: "Oh! oh!" said he, "whence comes all this
racket?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What has
happened, and who can the Ariadne be who expects me so
impatiently.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Let us
see!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> He then applied the tip
of his finger to the nail parallel to the one he had drawn.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Immediately the glass moved
like a folding-door and discovered a secret closet, rather deep,
into which the superintendent disappeared as if going into a vast
box.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When there, he
touched another spring, which opened, not a board, but a block of
the wall, and he went out by that opening, leaving the door to
shut of itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then
Fouquet descended about a score of steps which sank, winding,
underground, and came to a long, subterranean passage, lighted by

The walls of this vault were covered with slabs or tiles, and the
floor with carpeting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
This passage was under the street itself, which separated
Fouquet's house from the Park of Vincennes.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the end of the passage ascended a
winding staircase parallel with that by which Fouquet had
entered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He mounted these
other stairs, entered by means of a spring placed in a closet
similar to that in his cabinet, and from this closet an
untenanted chamber furnished with the utmost elegance.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As soon as he entered, he
examined carefully whether the glass closed without leaving any
trace, and, doubtless satisfied with his observation, he opened
by means of a small gold key the triple fastenings of a door in
front of him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This time
the door opened upon a handsome cabinet, sumptuously furnished,
in which was seated upon cushions a lady of surpassing beauty,
who at the sound of the lock sprang towards Fouquet.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Ah! good heavens!" cried the
latter, starting back with astonishment.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Madame la Marquise de
Belli&egrave;re, you here?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

marquise!" added Fouquet, ready to prostrate himself.<span style=

here?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And I, to keep you
waiting!"</p>

yes, a very long time!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

this waiting has appeared long to you, marquise!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

monsieur; oh!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I rang more
than twenty times.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Did
you not hear me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

you tremble."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

that you were summoned?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, yes; I heard
plainly enough, madame; but I could not come.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> After your rigors and your refusals,
how could I dream it was you?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If I could have had any suspicion of
the happiness that awaited me, believe me, madame, I would have
quitted everything to fall at your feet, as I do at this
moment."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Are we quite alone,
monsieur?" asked the marquise, looking round the room.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, yes, madame, I can
assure you of that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Really?" said the
marquise, in a melancholy tone.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You sigh!" said
Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What mysteries! what
precautions!" said the marquise, with a slight bitterness of
expression; "and how evident it is that you fear the least
suspicion of your amours to escape."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Would you prefer their
being made public?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, no; you act like a
delicate man," said the marquise, smiling.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Come, dear marquise,
punish me not with reproaches, I implore you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Reproaches!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Have I a right to make you any?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, unfortunately, no;
but tell me, you, who during a year I have loved without return
or hope - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are mistaken -
without hope it is true, but not without return."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What! for me, of my
love! there is but one proof, and that proof I still want."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Fouquet wished to clasp
her in his arms, but she disengaged herself with a gesture.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You persist in
deceiving yourself, monsieur, and will never accept of me the
only thing I am willing to give you - devotion."</p>

love me?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Devotion is but
a virtue, love is a passion."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Listen to me, I implore
you: I should not have come hither without a serious motive: you
are well assured of that, are you not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The motive is of very
little consequence, so that you are but here - so that I see you
- so that I speak to you!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are right; the
principal thing is that I am here without any one having seen me,
and that I can speak to you." - Fouquet sank on his knees before
her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Speak! speak,
madame!" said he, "I listen to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The marquise looked at
Fouquet, on his knees at her feet, and there was in the looks of
the woman a strange mixture of love and melancholy.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Oh!" at length murmured she, "would
that I were she who has the right of seeing you every minute, of
speaking to you every instant! would that I were she who might
watch over you, she who would have no need of mysterious springs
to summon and cause to appear, like a sylph, the man she loves,
to look at him for an hour, and then see him disappear in the
darkness of a mystery, still more strange at his going out than
at his coming in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh!
that would be to live like a happy woman!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do you happen,
marquise," said Fouquet, smiling, "to be speaking of my
wife?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

I spoke."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, you need not envy
her lot, marquise; of all the women with whom I have had any
relations, Madame Fouquet is the one I see the least of, and who
has the least intercourse with me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "At least, monsieur, she
is not reduced to place, as I have done, her hand upon the
ornament of a glass to call you to her; at least you do not reply
to her by the mysterious, alarming sound of a bell, the spring of
which comes from I don't know where; at least you have not
forbidden her to endeavor to discover the secret of these
communications under pain of breaking off forever your
connections with her, as you have forbidden all who come here
before me, and who will come after me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Dear marquise, how
unjust you are, and how little do you know what you are doing in
thus exclaiming against mystery; it is with mystery alone we can
love without trouble; it is with love without trouble alone that
we can be happy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But let
us return to ourselves, to that devotion of which you were
speaking, or rather let me labor under a pleasing delusion, and
believe this devotion is love."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Just now," repeated the
marquise, passing over her eyes a hand that might have been a
model for the graceful contours of antiquity; "just now I was
prepared to speak, my ideas were clear and bold; now I am quite
confused, quite troubled; I fear I bring you bad news."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "If it is to that bad
news I owe your presence, marquise, welcome be even that bad
news! or rather, marquise, since you allow that I am not quite
indifferent to you, let me hear nothing of the bad news, but
speak of yourself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, no, on the
contrary, demand it of me; require me to tell it to you
instantly, and not to allow myself to be turned aside by any

Fouquet, my friend! it is of immense importance."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

that is astonishing I confess, but is not terrible."</p>

he retook, with his head hanging down and a fixed cloud on his

hidden correspondents.</p>

when he heard some one knocking violently at the door, and a
well-known voice crying: - "Open the door, monseigneur, I entreat
you, open the door!"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Fouquet quickly restored a little order to everything that might
have revealed either his absence or his agitation: he spread his
papers over the desk, took up a pen, and, to gain time, said,
through the closed door, - "Who is there?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

they have passed a sentence, monseigneur."</p>

signed it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

eagerly, read it, and returned it to Gourville.<span style=

said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

head.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

for you do not know what Colbert is - study him quickly; it is

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! Gourville, this is

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Here is the proof,

Gourville held out to the superintendent a note communicated by a

Fouquet's creatures.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

superintendent, once again; "you are all deceived, and deceive me
in my turn; Lyodot came to see me only the day before yesterday;
only three days ago I received a present of some Syracuse wine
from poor D'Eymeris."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What does that prove?"
replied Gourville, "except that the chamber of justice has been
secretly assembled, has deliberated in the absence of the
accused, and that the whole proceeding was complete when they
were arrested."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What! are they, then,
arrested?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

how have they been arrested?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Lyodot, yesterday at
daybreak; D'Eymeris, the day before yesterday, in the evening, as
he was returning from the house of his mistress; their
disappearances had disturbed nobody; but at length M. Colbert all
at once raised the mask, and caused the affair to be published;
it is being cried by sound of trumpet, at this moment in Paris,
and, in truth, monseigneur, there is scarcely anybody but
yourself ignorant of the event."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Fouquet began to walk
about in his chamber with an uneasiness that became more and more

as usual.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The devil! if
my brother is there, my affairs are bad, Gourville; why did you

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

be reconciled to the abb&eacute;?" said Fouquet, ironically.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I advise you,
monseigneur, not to quarrel with a hundred or a hundred and
twenty loose fellows, who, by putting their rapiers end to end,
would form a cordon of steel capable of surrounding three
thousand men."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Fouquet darted a
searching glance at Gourville, and passing before him, - "That is
all very well; let M. l'Abb&eacute; Fouquet be introduced," said
he to the footman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "You
are right, Gourville."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Two minutes after, the
Abb&eacute; Fouquet appeared in the doorway, with profound
reverence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was a man
of from forty to forty-five years of age, half churchman, half
soldier, - a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>spadassin</i>
grafted upon an abb&eacute;; upon seeing that he had not a sword
by his side, you might be sure he had pistols.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fouquet saluted him more as elder
brother than as a minister.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What can I do to serve
you, monsieur l'abb&eacute;?" said he.</p>

speak to me, brother!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

is in a hurry, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The abb&eacute; looked
maliciously at Gourville, and anxiously at Fouquet, and said, "I
have three hundred pistoles to pay to M. de Bregi this
evening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A play debt, a
sacred debt."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What next?" said
Fouquet bravely, for he comprehended that the Abb&eacute; Fouquet
would not have disturbed him for such a want.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Twelve hundred to my
tailor," continued the abb&eacute;; "the fellow has made me take
back seven suits of my people's, which compromises my liveries,
and my mistress talks of replacing me by a farmer of the revenue,
which would be a humiliation for the church."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What else?" said
Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

remark," said the abb&eacute;, humbly, "that I have asked nothing

monsieur," replied Fouquet; "so, as you see, I wait."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

no, - it is not for want of need, though, I assure you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

for a minute.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Twelve

clothes," said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

said Fouquet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Are you a

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And do you ask me
that?" cried the Abb&eacute; Fouquet; "ah! how can you put such a

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

abb&eacute;, more and more affected.</p>

alone, could help myself very well; but you, you who have so many

you ought to have ten thousand.<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

the abb&eacute;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Listen,
then, to what happened, no longer ago than yesterday, in the Rue

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

I had one of my men in the crowd; a new recruit from the

saying to the joker: '<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mille

the abb&eacute; , triumphantly, "in which I spend my revenues; I

C</span>arriages were already bringing the guests of Fouquet to
Saint-Mand&eacute;; already the whole house was getting warm with
the preparations for supper, when the superintendent launched his
fleet horses upon the roads to Paris, and going by the quays, in
order to meet fewer people on the way, soon reached the
H&ocirc;tel de Ville.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It
wanted a quarter to eight.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fouquet alighted at the corner of
the Rue de Long-Pont, and, on foot, directed his course towards
the Place de Gr&egrave;ve, accompanied by Gourville.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the turning of the Place they saw
a man dressed in black and violet, of dignified mien, who was
preparing to stop at Vincennes.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had before him a large hamper
filled with bottles, which he had just purchased at the <i style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

replied the latter.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

doing at the sign of L'Image-de-Notre-Dame?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

at a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cabaret?</i>" said
Fouquet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "My cellar,
then, must be in a miserable condition!" and he advanced towards
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ma&icirc;tre

with the most minute care.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

He had a good and mild countenance, without expression - a
mathematician minus the pride.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A certain fire sparkled in the eyes
of this personage, a rather sly smile played round his lips; but
the observer might soon have remarked that this fire and this
smile applied to nothing, enlightened nothing.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Vatel laughed like an absent man,
and amused himself like a child.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the sound of his master's voice
he turned round, exclaiming: "Oh! monseigneur!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Fouquet's elbow.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Don't be angry, Vatel;
I thought my cellar - your cellar - sufficiently well stocked for
us to be able to dispense with recourse to the cellar of
L'Image-de-Notre-Dame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Eh, monsieur," said
Vatel, shrinking from monseigneur to monsieur with a degree of

your guests dine with you they have nothing to drink."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Fouquet, in great

wine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What is to be done,

Vatel, on his part, had much more to say, without doubt, and it

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Loret drinks cider at

Gourville, as he drew Fouquet's attention, by a gesture, to
another point.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He showed
him a low-built tumbrel, drawn by two horses, upon which rocked
two strong gibbets, bound together, back to back, by chains,

vagabonds, who guessed the destination of the gibbets, and were
escorting them to the H&ocirc;tel de Ville.<span style=

"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There his friends were assembled in
full chat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The intendant
was about to order supper to be served, but, above all, the
Abb&eacute; Fouquet watched for the return of his brother, and
was endeavoring to do the honors of the house in his
absence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Upon the arrival
of the superintendent, a murmur of joy and affection was heard;
Fouquet, full of affability, good humor, and munificence, was
beloved by his poets, his artists, and his men of business.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His brow, upon which his
little court read, as upon that of a god, all the movements of
his soul, and thence drew rules of conduct, - his brow, upon
which affairs of state never impressed a wrinkle, was this
evening paler than usual, and more than one friendly eye remarked
that pallor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fouquet
placed himself at the head of the table, and presided gayly
during supper.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He
recounted Vatel's expedition to La Fontaine, he related the
history of Menneville and the skinny fowl to P&eacute;lisson, in
such a manner that all the table heard it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A tempest of laughter and jokes
ensued, which was only checked by a serious and even sad gesture
from P&eacute;lisson.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
Abb&eacute; Fouquet, not being able to comprehend why his brother
should have led the conversation in that direction, listened with
all his ears, and sought in the countenance of Gourville, or in
that of his brother, an explanation which nothing afforded
him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> P&eacute;lisson took
up the matter: - "Did they mention M. Colbert, then?" said
he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why not?" replied
Fouquet; "if true, as it is said to be, that the king has made
him his intendant?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Scarcely had Fouquet uttered these words, with a marked
intention, than an explosion broke forth among the guests.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The miser!" said
one.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The mean, pitiful
fellow!" said another.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The hypocrite!" said a
third.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> P&eacute;lisson
exchanged a meaning look with Fouquet.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Messieurs," said he, "in truth we
are abusing a man whom no one knows: it is neither charitable nor
reasonable; and here is monsieur le surintendant, who, I am sure,
agrees with me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Entirely," replied
Fouquet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Let the fat
fowls of M. Colbert alone; our business to-day is with the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>faisans truff&eacute;s</i> of
M. Vatel."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This speech
stopped the dark cloud which was beginning to throw its shade
over the guests.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Gourville succeeded so well in animating the poets with the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>vin de Joigny</i>; the
abb&eacute;, intelligent as a man who stands in need of his
host's money, so enlivened the financiers and the men of the
sword, that, amidst the vapors of this joy and the noise of
conversation, inquietudes disappeared completely.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The will of Cardinal Mazarin was the
text of the conversation at the second course and dessert; then
Fouquet ordered bowls of sweetmeats and fountains of liquor to be
carried into the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>salon</i>
adjoining the gallery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He
led the way thither, conducting by the hand a lady, the queen, by
his preference, of the evening.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The musicians then supped, and the
promenades in the gallery and the gardens commenced, beneath a
spring sky, mild and flower-scented.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> P&eacute;lisson then approached the
superintendent, and said: "Something troubles monseigneur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Greatly," replied the
minister; "ask Gourville to tell you what it is."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> P&eacute;lisson, on turning round,
found La Fontaine treading upon his heels.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was obliged to listen to a Latin
verse, which the poet had composed upon Vatel.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> La Fontaine had, for an hour, been
scanning this verse in all corners, seeking some one to pour it
out upon advantageously.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
He thought he had caught P&eacute;lisson, but the latter escaped
him; he turned towards Sorel, who had, himself, just composed a
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>quatrain</i> in honor of
the supper, and the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Amphytrion</i>.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> La Fontaine in vain endeavored to
gain attention to his verses; Sorel wanted to obtain a hearing
for his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>quatrain</i>.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was obliged to retreat
before M. le Comte de Charost, whose arm Fouquet had just
taken.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> L'Abb&eacute;
Fouquet perceived that the poet, absent-minded, as usual, was
about to follow the two talkers; and he interposed.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> La Fontaine seized upon him, and
recited his verses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
abb&eacute;, who was quite innocent of Latin, nodded his head, in
cadence, at every roll which La Fontaine impressed upon his body,
according to the undulations of the dactyls and spondees.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> While this was going on,
behind the confiture-basins, Fouquet related the event of the day
to his son-in-law, M. de Charost.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "We will send the idle and useless
to look at the fireworks," said P&eacute;lisson to Gourville,
"whilst we converse here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "So be it," said
Gourville, addressing four words to Vatel.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The latter then led towards the
gardens the major part of the beaux, the ladies and the
chatterers, whilst the men walked in the gallery, lighted by
three hundred wax-lights, in the sight of all; the admirers of
fireworks all ran away towards the garden.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Gourville approached Fouquet, and
said: "Monsieur, we are here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "All?" said Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, - count."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The superintendent counted;
there were eight persons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
P&eacute;lisson and Gourville walked arm in arm, as if conversing
upon vague and frivolous subjects.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Sorel and two officers imitated
them, and in an opposite direction.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The Abb&eacute; Fouquet walked
alone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fouquet, with M.
de Charost, walked as if entirely absorbed in the conversation of
his son-in-law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Messieurs," said he, "let no one of you raise his head as he
walks, or appear to pay attention to me; continue walking, we are
alone, listen to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> A perfect silence
ensued, disturbed only by the distant cries of the joyous guests,
from the groves whence they beheld the fireworks. It was a
whimsical spectacle this, of these men walking in groups, as if
each one was occupied about something, whilst lending attention
really only to one amongst them, who, himself, seemed to be
speaking only to his companion.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Messieurs," said Fouquet, "you
have, without doubt, remarked the absence of two of my friends
this evening, who were with us on Wednesday.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> For God's sake, abb&eacute;, do not
stop, - it is not necessary to enable you to listen; walk on,
carrying your head in a natural way, and as you have excellent
sight, place yourself at the window, and if any one returns
towards the gallery, give us notice by coughing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The abb&eacute;
obeyed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I have not observed
their absence," said P&eacute;lisson, who, at this moment, was
turning his back to Fouquet, and walking the other way.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I do not see M.
Lyodot," said Sorel, "who pays me my pension."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And I," said the
abb&eacute;, at the window, "do not see M. d'Eymeris, who owes me
eleven hundred livres from our last game of brelan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sorel," continued
Fouquet, walking bent, and gloomily, "you will never receive your
pension any more from M. Lyodot; and you, abb&eacute;, will never
be paid you eleven hundred livres by M. d'Eymeris; for both are
doomed to die."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To die!" exclaimed the
whole assembly, arrested, in spite of themselves, in the comedy
they were playing, by that terrible word.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Recover yourselves,
messieurs," said Fouquet, "for perhaps we are watched - I said:
to die!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To die!" repeated
P&eacute;lisson; "what, the men I saw six days ago, full of
health, gayety, and the spirit of the future!<span style=

disease should thus bring him down all at once!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

said Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

remedy," said Sorel.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No remedy.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Messieurs de Lyodot and D'Eymeris
are on the eve of their last day."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Of what are these
gentlemen dying, then?" asked an officer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

them," replied Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Who kills them?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Are they being killed, then?"
cried the terrified chorus.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "They do better still;
the are hanging them," murmured Fouquet, in a sinister voice,
which sounded like a funeral knell in that rich gallery, splendid
with pictures, flowers, velvet, and gold.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Involuntarily every one stopped; the
abb&eacute; quitted his window; the first fuses of the fireworks
began to mount above the trees.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A prolonged cry from the gardens
attracted the superintendent to enjoy the spectacle.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He drew near to a window, and his
friends placed themselves behind him, attentive to his least
wish.</p>

P&eacute;lisson, "will be the bearer of the words."</p>

Fouquet, "five hundred thousand livres to the governor of the <i

A</span>s Fouquet was giving, or appearing to give, all his
attention to the brilliant illuminations, the languishing music
of the violins and hautboys, the sparkling sheaves of the
artificial fires, which, inflaming the heavens with glowing
reflections, marked behind the trees the dark profile of the
donjon of Vincennes; as, we say, the superintendent was smiling
on the ladies and the poets, the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>f&ecirc;te</i> was every whit as gay
as usual; and Vatel, whose restless, even jealous look, earnestly
consulted the aspect of Fouquet, did not appear dissatisfied with
the welcome given to the ordering of the evening's
entertainment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
fireworks over, the company dispersed about the gardens and
beneath the marble porticoes with the delightful liberty which
reveals in the master of the house so much forgetfulness of
greatness, so much courteous hospitality, so much magnificent
carelessness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The poets
wandered about, arm in arm, through the groves; some reclined
upon beds of moss, to the great damage of velvet clothes and
curled heads, into which little dried leaves and blades of grass
insinuated themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The ladies, in small numbers, listened to the songs of the
singers and the verses of the poets; others listened to the
prose, spoken with much art, by men who were neither actors nor
poets, but to whom youth and solitude gave an unaccustomed
eloquence, which appeared to them better than everything else in
the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Why," said La
Fontaine, "does not our master Epicurus descend into the
garden?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Epicurus never
abandoned his pupils; the master is wrong."</p>

A</span>t two o'clock the next day fifty thousand spectators had
taken their position upon the Place, around the two gibbets which
had been elevated between the Quai de la Gr&egrave;ve and the
Quai Pelletier; one close to the other, with their backs to the
embankment of the river.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
In the morning also, all the sworn criers of the good city of
Paris had traversed the quarters of the city, particularly the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>halles</i> and the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>faubourgs</i>, announcing with their
hoarse and indefatigable voices the great justice done by the
king upon two speculators, two thieves, devourers of the
people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And these people,
whose interests were so warmly looked after, in order not to fail
in respect for their king, quitted shops, stalls, and <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>atliers</i>, to go and evince a
little gratitude to Louis XIV., absolutely like invited guests,
who feared to commit an impoliteness in not repairing to the
house of him who had invited them.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> According to the tenor of the
sentence, which the criers read aloud and incorrectly, two
farmers of the revenues, monopolists of money, dilapidators of
the royal provisions, extortioners, and forgers, were about to
undergo capital punishment on the Place de Gr&egrave;ve, with
their names blazoned over their heads, according to their
sentence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As to those
names, the sentence made no mention of them.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The curiosity of the Parisians was
at its height, and, as we have said, an immense crowd waited with
feverish impatience the hour fixed for the execution.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The news had already spread that the
prisoners, transferred to the Ch&acirc;teau of Vincennes, would
be conducted from that prison to the Place de Gr&egrave;ve.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Consequently, the faubourg and
the Rue Saint Antoine were crowded; for the population of Paris
in those days of great executions was divided into two
categories: those who came to see the condemned pass - these were
of timid and mild hearts, but philosophically curious - and those
who wished to see the condemned die - these had hearts that
hungered for sensation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
On this day M. d'Artagnan received his last instructions from the
king, and made his adieus to his friends, the number of whom was,
at the moment, reduced to Planchet; then he traced the plan of
his day, as every busy man whose moments are counted ought to do,
because he appreciates their importance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My departure is to be,"
said he, "at break of day, three o'clock in the morning; I have
then fifteen hours before me.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Take from them the six hours of
sleep which are indispensable for me - six; one hour for repasts
- seven; one hour for a farewell visit to Athos - eight; two
hours for chance circumstances - total, ten.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There are then five hours left.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> One hour to get my money, -
that is, to have payment refused by M. Fouquet; another hour to
go and receive my money of M. Colbert, together with his
questions and grimaces; one hour to look over my clothes and
arms, and get my boots cleaned. <span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I still have two hours left.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mordioux!</i> how rich I am."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And so saying, D'Artagnan felt
a strange joy, a joy of youth, a perfume of those great and happy
years of former times mount into his brain and intoxicate
him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "During these two
hours I will go," said the musketeer, "and take my quarter's rent
of the Image-de-Notre-Dame.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That will be pleasant.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Three hundred and seventy-five
livres!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> <i style=

astonishing!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If the poor
man who has but one livre in his pocket, found a livre and twelve
deniers, that would be justice, that would be excellent; but
never does such a godsend fall to the lot of the poor man.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The rich man, on the contrary,
makes himself revenue with his money, which he does not even
touch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Here are three
hundred and seventy-five livres which fall to me from
heaven.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I will go then to
the Image-de-Notre-Dame, and drink a glass of Spanish wine with
my tenant, which he cannot fail to offer me.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But order must be observed, Monsieur
d'Artagnan, order must be observed!<span style=

distribute the employment of it!<span style=

Art. 7th and last, sleep."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> In consequence of this
arrangement, D'Artagnan went straight to the Comte de la
F&egrave;re, to whom, modestly and ingenuously, he related a part
of his fortunate adventures.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos had not been without
uneasiness on the subject of D'Artagnan's visit to the king; but
few words sufficed for an explanation of that.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos divined that Louis had charged
D'Artagnan with some important mission, and did not even make an
effort to draw the secret from him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He only recommended him to take care
of himself, and offered discreetly to accompany him if that were
desirable.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But, my dear friend,"
said D'Artagnan, " I am going nowhere."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What! you come and bid
me adieu, and are going nowhere?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! yes, yes," replied
D'Artagnan, coloring a little, "I am going to make an
acquisition."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is quite another
thing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then I change my
formula.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Instead of 'Do
not get yourself killed,' I will say, - 'Do not get yourself
robbed.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My friend, I will
inform you if I set eyes on any property that pleases me, and
shall expect you will favor me with your opinion."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, yes," said Athos,
too delicate to permit himself even the consolation of a
smile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Raoul imitated the
paternal reserve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But
D'Artagnan thought it would appear too mysterious to leave his
friends under a pretense, without even telling them the route he
was about to take."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I have chosen Le Mans,"
said he to Athos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "It is
a good country?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Excellent, my friend,"
replied the count, without making him observe that Le Mans was in
the same directions as La Touraine, and that by waiting two days,
at most, he might travel with a friend.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But D'Artagnan, more embarrassed
than the count, dug, at every explanation, deeper into the mud,
into which he sank by degrees.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I shall set out to-morrow at
daybreak," said he at last.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Till that time, will you come with
me, Raoul?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, monsieur le
chevalier," said the young man, "if monsieur le comte does not
want me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, Raoul; I am to have
an audience to-day of Monsieur, the king's brother; that is all I
have to do."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul asked Grimaud for
his sword, which the old man brought him immediately.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Now then," added D'Artagnan,
opening his arms to Athos, "adieu, my dear friend!"<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos held him in a long embrace,
and the musketeer, who knew his discretion so well, murmured in
his ear - "An affair of state," to which Athos only replied by a
pressure of the hand, still more significant.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They then separated.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Raoul took the arm of his old
friend, who led him along the Rue Saint-Honor&eacute;.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I an conducting you to the
abode of the god Plutus," said D'Artagnan to the young man;
"prepare yourself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
whole day you will witness the piling up of crowns.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Heavens! how I am changed!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! what numbers of
people there are in the street!" said Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Is there a procession
to-day?" asked D'Artagnan of a passer-by.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur, it is a
hanging," replied the man.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What! a hanging at the
Gr&egrave;ve?" said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The devil take the
rogue who gets himself hung the day I want to go and take my
rent!" cried D'Artagnan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Raoul, did you ever see anybody hung?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Never, monsieur - thank
God!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! how young that
sounds!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If you were on
guard in the trenches, as I was, and a spy!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But, pardon me, Raoul, I am doting -
you are quite right, it is a hideous sight to see a person
hung!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At what hour do
they hang them, monsieur, if you please?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur," replied the
stranger respectfully, delighted at joining conversation with two
men of the sword, "it will take place at about three
o'clock."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Aha! it is now only
half-past one; let us step out, we shall be there in time to
touch my three hundred and seventy-five livres, and get away
before the arrival of the malefactor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Malefactors, monsieur,"
continued the <i style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur, I return to
you many thanks," said D'Artagnan, who as he grew older, had
become polite to a degree.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Drawing Raoul along, he directed his
course rapidly in the direction of La Gr&egrave;ve.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Without that great experience
musketeers have of a crowd, to which were joined an irresistible
strength of wrist, and an uncommon suppleness of shoulders, our
two travelers would not have arrived at their place of
destination.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They
followed the line of the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Quai</i>, which they had gained on
quitting the Rue Saint-Honor&eacute;, where they left Athos.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan went first; his
elbow, his wrist, his shoulder formed three wedges which he knew
how to insinuate with skill into the groups, to make them split
and separate like firewood.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He made use sometimes of the hilt of
his sword as an additional help: introducing it between ribs that
were too rebellious, making it take the part of a lever or
crowbar, to separate husband from wife, uncle from nephew, and
brother from brother.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And
all that was done so naturally, and with such gracious smiles,
that people must have had ribs of bronze not to cry thank you
when the wrist made its play, or hearts of diamond not to be
enchanted when such a bland smile enlivened the lips of the
musketeer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Raoul,
following his friend, cajoled the women who admired his beauty,
pushed back the men who felt the rigidity of his muscles, and
both opened, thanks to these maneuvers, the compact and muddy
tide of the populace.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
They arrived in sight of the two gibbets, from which Raoul turned
away his eyes in disgust.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
As for D'Artagnan, he did not even see them; his house with its
gabled roof, its windows crowded with the curious, attracted and
even absorbed all the attention he was capable of.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He distinguished in the Place and
around the houses a good number of musketeers on leave, who, some
with women, others with friends, awaited the crowning
ceremony.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What rejoiced
him above all was to see that his tenant, the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cabaretier</i>, was so busy he
hardly knew which way to turn.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Three lads could not supply the
drinkers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They filled the
shop, the chambers, and the court, even.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan called Raoul's attention
to this concourse, adding: "The fellow will have no excuse for
not paying his rent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Look
at those drinkers, Raoul, one would say they were jolly
companions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>Mordioux!</i> why, there is no room
anywhere!"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan,
however, contrived to catch hold of the master by the corner of
his apron, and to make himself known to him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah, monsieur le

leave me alone here?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That
would be very wrong of you.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Look, there is yonder in the lower
court a tree, and under the shade of that tree we shall breathe
more freely than in this hot atmosphere of spilt wine."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> From the spot on which
they had placed themselves the two new guests of the
Image-de-Notre-Dame heard the ever-increasing hubbub of the tide
of people, and lost neither a cry nor a gesture of the drinkers,
at tables in the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cabaret</i>, or disseminated in the
chambers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If D'Artagnan
had wished to place himself as a <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>vidette</i> for an expedition, he
could not have succeeded better.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The tree under which he and Raoul
were seated covered them with its already thick foliage; it was a
low, thick chestnut-tree, with inclined branches, that cast their
shade over a table so dilapidated the drinkers had abandoned
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We said that from
this post D'Artagnan saw everything.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He observed the goings and comings
of the waiters; the arrival of fresh drinkers; the welcome,
sometimes friendly, sometimes hostile, given to the newcomers by
others already installed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
He observed all this to amuse himself, for the thirty-seven and a
half pistoles were a long time coming.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Raoul recalled his attention to
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Monsieur," said he,
"you do not hurry your tenant, and the condemned will soon be
here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There will then be
such a press we shall not be able to get out."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are right," said
the musketeer; "<i style=

there!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mordioux!</i>"<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But it was in vain he cried and
knocked upon the wreck of the old table, which fell to pieces
beneath his fist; nobody came.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan was preparing to go and
seek the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cabaretier</i>
himself, to force him to a definite explanation, when the door of
the court in which he was with Raoul, a door which communicated
with the garden situated at the back, opened, and a man dressed
as a cavalier, with his sword in the sheath, but not at his belt,
crossed the court without closing the door; and having cast an
oblique glance at D'Artagnan and his companion, directed his
course towards the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cabaret</i> itself, looking about in
all directions with his eyes capable of piercing walls of
consciences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Humph!"
said D'Artagnan, "my tenants are communicating.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That, no doubt, now, is some amateur
in hanging matters."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At
the same moment the cries and disturbance in the upper chambers
ceased.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Silence, under
such circumstances, surprises more than a twofold increase of
noise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan wished
to see what was the cause of this sudden silence.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He then perceived that this man,
dressed as a cavalier, had just entered the principal chamber,
and was haranguing the tipplers, who all listened to him with the
greatest attention.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan would perhaps have heard his speech but for the
dominant noise of the popular clamors, which made a formidable
accompaniment to the harangue of the orator.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But it was soon finished, and all
the people the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cabaret</i>
contained came out, one after the other, in little groups, so
that there only remained six in the chamber; one of these six,
the man with the sword, took the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cabaretier</i> aside, engaging him
in discourse more or less serious, whilst the others lit a great
fire in the chimney-place - a circumstance rendered strange by
the fine weather and the heat.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is very singular,"
said D'Artagnan to Raoul, "but I think I know those faces
yonder."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Don't you think you can
smell the smoke here?" said Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I rather think I can
smell a conspiracy," replied D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> He had not finished
speaking, when four of these men came down into the court, and
without the appearance of any bad design, mounted guard at the
door of communication, casting, at intervals, glances at
D'Artagnan, which signified many things.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mordioux!</i>" said D'Artagnan, in a
low voice," there is something going on.<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "According to the
subject, chevalier."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, I am as curious
as an old woman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Come a
little more in front; we shall get a better view of the
place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I would lay a
wager that view will be something curious."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But you know, monsieur

indifferent spectator of the death of the two poor devils."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

will go in again, when it is time to do so.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Come along!"<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And they made their way towards the
front of the house, and placed themselves near the window which,
still more strangely than the rest, remained unoccupied.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The two last drinkers, instead
of looking out at this window, kept up the fire.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On seeing D'Artagnan and his friend
enter: - "Ah! ah! a reinforcement," murmured they.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan jogged
Raoul's elbow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Yes, my
braves, a reinforcement," said he; "<i style=

fire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Whom are you going
to cook?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The two men uttered a
shout of jovial laughter, and, instead of answering, threw on
more wood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan
could not take his eyes off them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I suppose," said one of
the fire-makers, "they sent you to tell us the time - did not
they?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Without doubt they
have," said D'Artagnan, anxious to know what was going on; "why
should I be here else, if it were not for that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Then place yourself at
the window, if you please, and observe."<span style=

made a sign to Raoul, and placed himself at the window.</p>

T</span>he spectacle which the Gr&egrave;ve now presented was a
frightful one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The heads,
leveled by the perspective, extended afar, thick and agitated as
the ears of corn in a vast plain.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> From time to time a fresh report, or
a distant rumor, made the heads oscillate and thousands of eyes
flash.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now and then there
were great movements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> All
those ears of corn bent, and became waves more agitated than
those of the ocean, which rolled from the extremities to the
center, and beat, like the tides, against the hedge of archers
who surrounded the gibbets.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then the handles of the halberds
were let fall upon the heads and shoulders of the rash invaders;
at times, also, it was the steel as well as the wood, and, in
that case, a large empty circle was formed around the guard; a
space conquered upon the extremities, which underwent, in their
turn the oppression of the sudden movement, which drove them
against the parapets of the Seine.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> From the window, that commanded a
view of the whole Place, D'Artagnan saw, with interior
satisfaction, that such of the musketeers and guards as found
themselves involved in the crowd, were able, with blows of their
fists and the hilts of theirs swords, to keep room.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He even remarked that they had
succeeded, by that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>esprit
de corps</i> which doubles the strength of the soldier, in
getting together in one group to the amount of about fifty men;
and that, with the exception of a dozen stragglers whom he still
saw rolling here and there, the nucleus was complete, and within
reach of his voice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But
it was not the musketeers and guards that drew the attention of
D'Artagnan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Around the
gibbets, and particularly at the entrances to the arcade of
Saint-Jean, moved a noisy mass, a busy mass; daring faces,
resolute demeanors were to be seen here and there, mingled with
silly faces and indifferent demeanors; signals were exchanged,
hands given and taken.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan remarked among the groups, and those groups the most
animated, the face of the cavalier whom he had seen enter by the
door of communication from his garden, and who had gone upstairs
to harangue the drinkers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
That man was organizing troops and giving orders.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mordioux!</i>" said D'Artagnan to
himself, "I was not deceived; I know that man, - it is
Menneville.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What the
devil is he doing here?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> A distant murmur, which
became more distinct by degrees, stopped this reflection, and
drew his attention another way.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This murmur was occasioned by the
arrival of the culprits; a strong picket of archers preceded
them, and appeared at the angle of the arcade.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The entire crowd now joined as if in
one cry; all the cries united formed one immense howl.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan saw Raoul was
becoming pale, and he slapped him roughly on the shoulder.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The fire-keepers turned round
on hearing the great cry, and asked what was going on.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "The condemned are arrived,"
said D'Artagnan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "That's
well," replied they, again replenishing the fire.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan looked at them with much
uneasiness; it was evident that these men who were making such a
fire for no apparent purpose had some strange intentions.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The condemned appeared upon
the Place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They were
walking, the executioner before them, whilst fifty archers formed
a hedge on their right and their left.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Both were dressed in black; they
appeared pale, but firm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
They looked impatiently over the people's heads, standing on
tip-toe at every step.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan remarked this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mordioux!</i>" cried he,
"they are in a great hurry to get a sight of the gibbet!"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Raoul drew back, without,
however, having the power to leave the window.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Terror even has its attractions.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To the death! to the
death!" cried fifty thousand voices.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

howled a hundred frantic others, as if the great mass had given
them the reply.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well," said D'Artagnan,
"this is droll; I should have thought it was M. Colbert who had
caused them to be hung."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> There was, at this
moment, a great rolling movement in the crowd, which stopped for
a moment the march of the condemned.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The people of a bold and resolute
mien, whom D'Artagnan had observed, by dint of pressing, pushing,
and lifting themselves up, had succeeded in almost touching the
hedge of archers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cort&eacute;ge</i> resumed its
march.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> All at once, to
cries of "<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Vive Colbert<span
style='mso-bidi-font-style: italic'>!</span></i>" those men, of
whom D'Artagnan never lost sight, fell upon the escort, which in
vain endeavored to stand against them.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Behind these men was the crowd.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then commenced, amidst a
frightful tumult, as frightful a confusion.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This time there was something more
than cries of expectation or cries of joy, there were cries of
pain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Halberds struck men
down, swords ran through them, muskets were discharged at
them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The confusion
became then so great that D'Artagnan could no longer distinguish
anything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then, from this
chaos, suddenly surged something like a visible intention, like a
will pronounced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
condemned had been torn from the hands of the guards, and were
being dragged towards the house of L'Image-de-Notre-Dame.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Those who dragged them
shouted, "<i style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>Vive</i>
<i>Colbert!</i>"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
people hesitated, not knowing which they ought to fall upon, the
archers or the aggressors.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What stopped the people was, that
those who cried "<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Vive

began to cry, at the same time, "No halter! no halter! to the
fire! to the fire! burn the thieves! burn the extortioners!"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This cry, shouted with an <i

enthusiastic success.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
populace had come to witness an execution, and here was an
opportunity offered them of performing one themselves.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was this that must be most
agreeable to the populace: therefore, they ranged themselves
immediately on the party of the aggressors against the archers,
crying with the minority, which had become, thanks to them, the
most compact majority: "Yes, yes: to the fire with the
thieves!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> <i style=

"this begins to look serious."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> One of the men who
remained near the chimney approached the window, a firebrand in
his hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Ah, ah!" said
he, "it gets warm."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then,
turning to his companion: "There is the signal," added he; and he
immediately applied the burning brand to the wainscoting.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now, this <i style=

Image-de-Notre-Dame was not a very newly built house, and
therefore, did not require much entreating to take fire.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In a second the boards began
to crackle, and the flames arose sparkling to the ceiling.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A howling from without replied
to the shouts of the incendiaries.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan, who had not seen what
passed, from being engaged at the window, felt, at the same time,
the smoke which choked him and the fire that scorched him.<span

round, "is the fire here?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The two men looked at
each other with an air of astonishment.<span style=

"was it not a thing agreed upon?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A thing agreed upon

the brand from the hand of the incendiary, and striking him with
it across the face.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
second wanted to assist his comrade, but Raoul, seizing him by
the middle, threw him out of the window, whilst D'Artagnan pushed
his man down the stairs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Raoul, first disengaged, tore the burning wainscoting down, and
threw it flaming into the chamber.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At a glance D'Artagnan saw there was
nothing to be feared from the fire, and sprang to the
window.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The disorder was
at its height.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The air
was filled with simultaneous cries of "To the fire!"<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Menneville, firing his pistol almost within an arm's length.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But before the cock fell,
D'Artagnan had struck up Menneville's arm with the hilt of his
sword and passed the blade through his body.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I told you plainly to
keep yourself quiet," said D'Artagnan to Menneville, who rolled
at his feet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Passage! passage!"
cried the companions of Menneville, at first terrified, but soon
recovering, when they found they had only to do with two
men.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But those two men
were hundred-armed giants; the swords flew about in their hands
like the burning <i style=

strike with the flat, cut with the edge; every stroke brings down
a man.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "For the king!"
cried D'Artagnan, to every man he struck at, that is to say, to
every man that fell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This
cry became the charging word for the musketeers, who, guided by
it, joined D'Artagnan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
During this time the archers, recovering from the panic they had
undergone, charge the aggressors in the rear, and regular as mill
strokes, overturn or knock down all that opposed them.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The crowd, which sees swords
gleaming, and drops of blood flying in the air - the crowd falls
back and crushes itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
At length cries for mercy and of despair resound; that is, the
farewell of the vanquished.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The two condemned are again in the
hands of the archers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan approaches them, seeing them pale and sinking:
"Console yourselves, poor men," said he, "you will not undergo
the frightful torture with which these wretches threatened
you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king has
condemned you to be hung: you shall only be hung.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Go on, hang them, and it will be
over."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

anything going on at the Image-de-Notre-Dame.<span style=

two tuns of wine in default of water.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The conspirators have fled by the
garden.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The archers are
dragging the culprits to the gibbets.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> From this moment the affair did not
occupy much time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
executioner, heedless about operating according to the rules of
the art, made such haste that he dispatched the condemned in a
couple of minutes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the
meantime the people gathered around D'Artagnan, - they
felicitated, they cheered him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He wiped his brow, streaming with
sweat, and his sword, streaming with blood.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He shrugged his shoulders at seeing
Menneville writhing at his feet in the last convulsions.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And, while Raoul turned away
his eyes in compassion, he pointed to the musketeers the gibbets
laden with their melancholy fruit.<span style=

died blessing me, for I saved them with great difficulty."<span

Menneville at the moment when he himself was breathing his last
sigh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A dark, ironical
smile flitted across his lips; he wished to reply, but the effort
hastened the snapping of the chord of life - he expired.</p>

W</span>hilst this violent, noisy, and bloody scene was passing
on the Gr&egrave;ve, several men, barricaded behind the gate of
communication with the garden, replaced their swords in their
sheaths, assisted one among them to mount a ready saddled horse
which was waiting in the garden, and like a flock of startled
birds, fled in all directions, some climbing the walls, others
rushing out at the gates with all the fury of a panic.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He who mounted the horse, and
gave him the spur so sharply that the animal was near leaping the
wall, this cavalier, we say, crossed the Place Baudoyer, passed
like lightening before the crowd in the streets, riding against,
running over and knocking down all that came in his way, and, ten
minutes after, arrived at the gates of the superintendent, more
out of breath than his horse.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The Abb&eacute; Fouquet, at the
clatter of hoofs on the pavement, appeared at a window of the
court, and before even the cavalier had set foot to the ground,
"Well!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Danicamp?" cried
he, leaning half out of the window.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

replied the cavalier.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

abb&eacute;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Then they
are saved?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

the cavalier, "they are hung."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

abb&eacute;, turning pale.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A lateral door suddenly opened, and
Fouquet appeared in the chamber, pale, distracted, with lips half
opened, breathing a cry of grief and anger.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He stopped upon the threshold to
listen to what was addressed from the court to the window.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Gr&egrave;ve."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Fouquet raised his brow,
streaming with sweat, murmuring, "Oh!<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The abb&eacute; made a
sign, and in half a minute the man's step was heard upon the
stairs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the same time
Gourville appeared behind Fouquet, like the guardian angel of the
superintendent, pressing one finger on his lips to enjoin
observation even amidst the bursts of his grief.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The minister resumed all the
serenity that human strength left at the disposal of a heart half
broken with sorrow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Danicamp appeared.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Make
your report," said Gourville.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

given to Menneville.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Menneville knew what was to be done, and Menneville is dead."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This news appeared
rather to reassure Gourville than to sadden him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, certainly to burn
them alive," said the abb&eacute;, eagerly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Granted, monsieur,
granted," said the man, looking into the eyes and the faces of
the two interlocutors, to ascertain what there was profitable or
disadvantageous to himself in telling the truth.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Now, proceed," said
Gourville.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The prisoners," cried
Danicamp, "were brought to the Gr&egrave;ve, and the people, in a
fury, insisted upon their being burnt instead of being hung."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And the people were
right," said the abb&eacute;.<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But," resumed the man,
"at the moment the archers were broken, at the moment the fire
was set to one of the houses of the Place destined to serve as a
funeral-pile for the guilty, this fury, this demon, this giant of
whom I told you, and who, we had been informed, was the
proprietor of the house in question, aided by a young man who
accompanied him, threw out of the window those who kept the fire,
called to his assistance the musketeers who were in the crowd,
leaped himself from the window of the first story into the Place,
and plied his sword so desperately that the victory was restored
to the archers, the prisoners were retaken, and Menneville
killed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When once
recaptured, the condemned were executed in three minutes."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fouquet, in spite of his
self-command, could not prevent a deep groan escaping him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

proprietor of the house, what is his name?" said the
abb&eacute;.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I cannot tell you, not
having even been able to get sight of him; my post had been
appointed in the garden, and I remained at my post: only the
affair was related to me as I repeat it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I was ordered, when once the affair
was at an end, to come at best speed and announce to you the
manner in which it finished.<span style=

full gallop, and here I am."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very well, monsieur, we
have nothing else to ask of you," said the abb&eacute;, more and
more dejected, in proportion as the moment approached for finding
himself alone with his brother.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Have you been paid?"
asked Gourville.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

replied Danicamp.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

the true interests of the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, monsieur," said
the man, bowing and pocketing the money.<span style=

him when Fouquet, who had remained motionless, advanced with a
rapid step and stood between the abb&eacute; and Gourville.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Both of them at the same time
opened their mouths to speak to him.<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

will not prevent me," replied the latter, "from endeavoring to
find out the miserable fellow who has intervened to the advantage
of M. Colbert in this so well-arranged affair; for, if it is good
policy to love our friends dearly, I do not believe that is bad

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A truce to policy,

you, gentlemen: no reprisals, I forbid them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

grumbled the abb&eacute;, "which will prevent me from avenging a
family affront upon the guilty person."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

in that imperative tone to which one feels there is nothing to
reply, "if you entertain one thought, one single thought, which
is not the absolute expression of my will, I will have you cast
into the Bastile two hours after that thought has manifested
itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Regulate your
conduct accordingly, abb&eacute;."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

sign to Gourville to follow him, and was already directing his
steps towards his cabinet, when the usher announced with a loud
voice: "Monsieur le Chevalier d'Artagnan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Who is he?" said
Fouquet, negligently, to Gourville.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

majesty's musketeers," replied Gourville, in the same tone.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fouquet did not even take the
trouble to reflect, and resumed his walk.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I beg your pardon, monseigneur!"
said Gourville, "but I have remembered; this brave man has
quitted the king's service, and probably comes to receive an
installment of some pension or other."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Devil take him!" said
Fouquet, "why does he choose his opportunity so ill?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Permit me then,
monseigneur, to announce your refusal to him; for he is one of my

would be better to have as a friend than an enemy."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Answer him as you
please," said Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Eh! good Lord!" said
the abb&eacute;, still full of malice, like an egotistical man;
"tell him there is no money, particularly for musketeers."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> But scarcely had the
abb&eacute; uttered this imprudent speech, when the partly open

whether he should choose to praise or blame.<span style=

instinctive with people of abject condition; they have the sense

understood that there was a pleasure to offer to M. Colbert, in
rendering him an account of the fashion in which his name had
been pronounced during the rash enterprise of the morning.<span

just as the chief of the watch was giving his report.<span style=

the archers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That officer
took Colbert on one side, in spite of his resistance and the

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

monsieur?" said Colbert.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

musketeer with his deliberate tone; "it appears that you had in
Menneville a pretty enemy."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

D'Artagnan, "to think to play the great man and the hypocrite
with me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well," continued
he to Colbert, "I am very happy to have rendered so good a
service to the king; will you take upon you to tell his majesty,
monsieur l'intendant?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What commission is this
you give me, and what do you charge me to tell his majesty,
monsieur?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Be precise, if
you please," said Colbert, in a sharp voice, tuned beforehand to
hostility.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I give you no
commission," replied D'Artagnan, with that calmness which never
abandons the banterer; "I thought it would be easy for you to
announce to his majesty that it was I who, being there by chance,
did justice upon Menneville and restored order to things."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Colbert opened his eyes
and interrogated the chief of the watch with a look - "Ah! it is
very true," said the latter, "that this gentleman saved us."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why did you not tell
me, monsieur, that you came to relate me this?" said Colbert with
envy; "everything is explained, and more favorably for you than
for anybody else."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are in error,
monsieur l'intendant, I did not at all come for the purpose of
relating that to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is an exploit,
nevertheless."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh!" said the musketeer
carelessly, "constant habit blunts the mind."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To what do I owe the
honor of your visit, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Simply to this: the
king ordered me to come to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!" said Colbert,
recovering himself when he saw D'Artagnan draw a paper from his
pocket; "it is to demand some money of me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Precisely,
monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan turned upon
his heel, insolently enough, and finding himself face to face
with Colbert, after his first turn, he bowed to him as a
harlequin would have done; then, after a second evolution, he
directed his steps towards the door in quick time.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Colbert was struck with this pointed
rudeness, to which he was not accustomed.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In general, men of the sword, when
they came to his office, had such a want of money, that though
their feet seemed to take root in the marble, they hardly lost
their patience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Was
D'Artagnan going straight to the king?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Would he go and describe his rough
reception, or recount his exploit?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This was a matter for grave
consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At all
events, the moment was badly chosen to send D'Artagnan away,
whether he came from the king, or on his own account. <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The musketeer had rendered too
great a service, and that too recently, for it to be already
forgotten.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Therefore
Colbert thought it would be better to shake off his arrogance and
call D'Artagnan back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Ho!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monsieur
d'Artagnan," cried Colbert, "what! are you leaving me thus?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan turned round:
"Why not?" said he, quietly, "we have no more to say to each
other, have we?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

money to receive, as you have an order?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Paid, by whom?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Colbert grew pale.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Explain yourself," said
he, in a stifled voice - "if you are paid why do you show me that
paper?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In consequence of the
word of order of which you spoke to me so ingeniously just now,
dear M. Colbert; the king told me to take a quarter of the
pension he is pleased to make me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Of me?" said
Colbert.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Not exactly.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king said to me: 'Go to M.
Fouquet; the superintendent will, perhaps, have no money, then
you will go and draw it of M. Colbert.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The countenance of M.
Colbert brightened for a moment; but it was with his unfortunate
physiognomy as with a stormy sky, sometimes radiant, sometimes
dark as night, according as the lightening gleams or the cloud
passes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Eh! and was
there any money in the superintendent's coffers?" asked he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why, yes, he could not
be badly off for money," replied D'Artagnan - "it may be
believed, since M. Fouquet, instead of paying me a quarter or
five thousand livres - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A quarter or five
thousand livres!" cried Colbert, struck, as Fouquet had been,
with the generosity of the sum for a soldier's pension, "why,
that would be a pension of twenty thousand livres?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Exactly, M.
Colbert.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>Peste!</i> you reckon like old
Pythagoras; yes, twenty thousand livres."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ten times the
appointment of an intendant of the finances.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I beg to offer you my compliments,"
said Colbert, with a vicious smile.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh!" said D'Artagnan,
"the king apologized for giving me so little; but he promised to
make it more hereafter, when he should be rich; but I must be
gone, having much to do - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "So, then,
notwithstanding the expectation of the king, the superintendent
paid you, did he?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In the same manner, as,
in opposition to the king's expectation, you refused to pay
me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I did not refuse,
monsieur, I only begged you to wait.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And you say that M. Fouquet paid you
your five thousand livres?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, as <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>you</i> might have done; but he did
even better than that, M. Colbert."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And what did he
do?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He politely counted me
down the sum-total, saying, that for the king, his coffers were
always full."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The sum-total!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M. Fouquet has given you
twenty thousand livres instead of five thousand?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And what for?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In order to spare me
three visits to the money-chest of the superintendent, so that I
have the twenty thousand livres in my pocket in good new
coin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You see, then, that
I am able to go away without standing in need of you, having come
here only for form's sake."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And D'Artagnan slapped his hand upon
his pocket, with a laugh which disclosed to Colbert thirty-two
magnificent teeth, as white as teeth of twenty-five years old,
and which seemed to say in their language: "Serve up to us
thirty-two little Colberts, and we will chew them
willingly."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The serpent
is as brave as the lion, the hawk as courageous as the eagle,
that cannot be contested.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
It can only be said of animals that are decidedly cowardly, and
are so called, that they will be brave only when they have to
defend themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Colbert was not frightened at the thirty-two teeth of
D'Artagnan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He recovered,
and suddenly, - "Monsieur," said he, "monsieur le surintendant
has done what he had no right to do."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What do you mean by
that?" replied D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I mean that your note -
will you let me see your note, if you please?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very willingly; here it
is."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Colbert seized the paper
with an eagerness which the musketeer did not remark without
uneasiness, and particularly without a certain degree of regret
at having trusted him with it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Well, monsieur, the royal order
says thus: - 'At sight, I command that there be paid to M.
d'Artagnan the sum of five thousand livres, forming a quarter of
the pension I have made him.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "So, in fact, it is
written," said D'Artagnan, affecting calmness.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very well; the king
only owed you five thousand livres; why has more been given to
you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Because there was more;
and M. Fouquet was willing to give me more; that does not concern
anybody."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is natural," said
Colbert with a proud ease, "that you should be ignorant of the
usages of state-finance; but, monsieur, when you have a thousand
livres to pay, what do you do?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I never have a thousand
livres to pay," replied D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Once more," said
Colbert, irritated - "once more, if you had any sum to pay, would
you not pay what you ought?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That only proves one
thing," said D'Artagnan; "and that is, that you have your own
particular customs in finance, and M. Fouquet has his own."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Mine, monsieur, are the
correct ones."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

are not."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

what was not due to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

flashed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "What is not due

say, M. Colbert; for if I have received what was not due to me at
all, I should have committed a theft."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Colbert made no reply to
this subtlety.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "You then
owe fifteen thousand livres to the public chest," said he,
carried away by his jealous ardor.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Then you must give me
credit for them," replied D'Artagnan, with his imperceptible
irony.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

that he does not even take care of vouchers for the sums that he
has paid."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! now I understand
why you have taken that paper, M. Colbert!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Colbert did not perceive
all that there was of a threatening character in his name
pronounced in a certain manner.<span style=

will make of it," said he, holding up the paper in his
fingers.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh!" said D'Artagnan,
snatching the paper from him with a rapid movement; "I understand
perfectly well, M. Colbert; I have no occasion to wait for
that."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he crumpled up
the paper he had so cleverly seized.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

out, laughing in the face of the future minister.</p>

F</span>or a man who had seen so many much more dangerous ones,
the position of D'Artagnan with respect to M. Colbert was only
comic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan,
therefore, did not deny himself the satisfaction of laughing at
the expense of monsieur l'intendant, from the Rue des
Petits-Champs to the Rue des Lombards.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was a great while since
D'Artagnan had laughed so long together.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was still laughing when Planchet
appeared, laughing likewise, at the door of his house; for
Planchet, since the return of his patron, since the entrance of
the English guineas, passed the greater part of his life in doing
what D'Artagnan had only done from the Rue Neuve des
Petits-Champs to the Rue des Lombards.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are home, then, my
dear master?" said Planchet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, my friend," replied
the musketeer; "I am off, and that quickly.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I will sup with you, go to bed,
sleep five hours, and at break of day leap into my saddle.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Has my horse had an extra
feed?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Eh! my dear master,"
replied Planchet, "you know very well that your horse is the
jewel of the family; that my lads are caressing it all day, and
cramming it with sugar, nuts, and biscuits.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You ask me if he has had an extra
feed of oats; you should ask if he has not had enough to burst
him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very well, Planchet,
that is all right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now,
then, I pass to what concerns me - my supper?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ready.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A smoking roast joint, white wine,
crayfish, and fresh-gathered cherries.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> All ready, my master."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are a capital
fellow, Planchet; come on, then, let us sup, and I will go to
bed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> During supper D'Artagnan
observed that Planchet kept rubbing his forehead, as if to
facilitate the issue of some idea closely pent within his
brain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He looked with an
air of kindness at this worthy companion of former adventures and
misadventures, and, clinking glass against glass, "Come,
Planchet," said he, "let us see what it is that gives you so much
trouble to bring forth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mordioux!</i><span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Speak freely, and quickly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, this is it,"
replied Planchet: "you appear to me to be going on some
expedition or another."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I don't say that I am
not."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Then you have some new
idea?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is possible, too,
Planchet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Then there will be
fresh capital to be ventured?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I will lay down fifty thousand
livres upon the idea you are about to carry out."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And so saying, Planchet rubbed his
hands one against the other with a rapidity evincing great
delight.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Planchet," said
D'Artagnan, "there is but one misfortune in it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And what is that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That the idea is not
mine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I can risk nothing
upon it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> These words drew a deep
sigh from the heart of Planchet.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That Avarice is an ardent counselor;
she carries away her man, as Satan did Jesus, to the mountain,
and when once she has shown to an unfortunate all the kingdoms of
the earth, she is able to repose herself, knowing full well that
she has left her companion, Envy, to gnaw at his heart.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Planchet had tasted of riches
easily acquired, and was never afterwards likely to stop in his
desires; but, as he had a good heart in spite of his
covetousness, as he adored D'Artagnan, he could not refrain from
making him a thousand recommendations, each more affectionate
than the others.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He would
not have been sorry, nevertheless, to have caught a little hint
of the secret his master concealed so well; tricks, turns,
counsels, and traps were all useless, D'Artagnan let nothing
confidential escape him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The evening passed thus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
After supper the portmanteau occupied D'Artagnan, he took a turn
to the stable, patted his horse, and examined his shoes and legs;
then, having counted over his money, he went to bed, sleeping as
if only twenty, because he had neither inquietude nor remorse; he
closed his eyes five minutes after he had blown out his
lamp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Many events might,
however, have kept him awake.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Thought boiled in his brain,
conjectures abounded, and D'Artagnan was a great drawer of
horoscopes; but, with that imperturbable phlegm which does more
than genius for the fortune and happiness of men of action, he
put off reflection till the next day, for fear, he said, not to
be fresh when he wanted to be so.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The day came.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The Rue des Lombards had its
share of the caresses of Aurora with the rosy fingers, and
D'Artagnan arose like Aurora.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He did not awaken anybody, he placed
his portmanteau under his arm, descended the stairs without
making one of them creak, and without disturbing one of the
sonorous snorings in every story from the garret to the cellar,
then, having saddled his horse, shut the stable and house doors,
he set off, at a foot-pace, on his expedition to Bretagne.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had done quite right not to
trouble himself with all the political and diplomatic affairs
which solicited his attention; for, in the morning, in freshness
and mild twilight, his ideas developed themselves in purity and
abundance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the first
place, he passed before the house of Fouquet, and threw in a
large gaping box the fortunate order which, the evening before,
he had had so much trouble to recover from the hooked fingers of
the intendant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Placed in
an envelope, and addressed to Fouquet, it had not even been
divined by Planchet, who in divination was equal to Calchas or
the Pythian Apollo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan thus sent back the order to Fouquet, without
compromising himself, and without having thenceforward any
reproaches to make himself.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When he had effected this proper
restitution, "Now," he said to himself, "let us inhale much
maternal air, much freedom from cares, much health, let us allow
the horse Zephyr, whose flanks puff as if he had to respire an
atmosphere, to breathe, and let us be very ingenious in our
little calculations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It
is time," said D'Artagnan, "to form a plan of the campaign, and,
according to the method of M. Turenne, who has a large head full
of all sorts of good counsels, before the plan of the campaign it
is advisable to draw a striking portrait of the generals to whom
we are opposed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the
first place, M. Fouquet presents himself.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What is M. Fouquet?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M. Fouquet," replied D'Artagnan to
himself, "is a handsome man, very much beloved by the women, a
generous man very much beloved by the poets; a man of wit, much
execrated by pretenders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Well, now I am neither woman, poet, nor pretender: I neither love
not hate monsieur le surintendant.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I find myself, therefore, in the
same position in which M. Turenne found himself when opposed to
the Prince de Cond&eacute; at Jargeau, Gien and the Faubourg
Saint-Antoine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He did not
execrate monsieur le prince, it is true, but he obeyed the
king.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monsieur le prince
is an agreeable man, but the king is king.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Turenne heaved a deep sigh, called
Cond&eacute; 'My cousin,' and swept away his army.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now what does the king wish?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That does not concern me.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now, what does M. Colbert
wish?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh, that's another
thing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M. Colbert wishes
all that M. Fouquet does not wish.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then what does M. Fouquet wish?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh, that is serious.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M. Fouquet wishes precisely
for all the king wishes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This monologue ended,
D'Artagnan began to laugh, whilst making his whip whistle in the
air.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was already on
the high road, frightening the birds in the hedges, listening to
the livres chinking and dancing in his leather pocket, at every
step; and, let us confess it, every time that D'Artagnan found
himself in such conditions, tenderness was not his dominant
vice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Come," said he, "I
cannot think the expedition a very dangerous one; and it will

I</span>t was perhaps the fiftieth time since the day on which we
open this history, that this man, with a heart of bronze and
muscles of steel, had left house and friends, everything, in
short, to go in search of fortune and death.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The one - that is to say, death -
had constantly retreated before him, as if afraid of him; the
other - that is to say, fortune - for only a month past had
really made an alliance with him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Although he was not a great
philosopher, after the fashion of either Epicurus or Socrates, he
was a powerful spirit, having knowledge of life, and endowed with
thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No one is as
brave, as adventurous, or as skillful as D'Artagnan, without at
the same time being inclined to be a <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>dreamer</i>.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had picked up, here and there,
some scraps of M. de la Rochefoucault, worthy of being translated
into Latin by MM. de Port Royal; and he had made a collection, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>en passant</i>, in the society
of Athos and Aramis, of many morsels of Seneca and Cicero,
translated by them, and applied to the uses of common life.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That contempt of riches which
our Gascon had observed as an article of faith during the
thirty-five first years of his life, had for a long time been
considered by him as the first article of the code of
bravery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Article first,"
said he, "A man is brave because he has nothing.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A man has nothing because he
despises riches."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Therefore, with these principles, which, as we have said, had
regulated the thirty-five first years of his life, D'Artagnan was
no sooner possessed of riches, than he felt it necessary to ask
himself if, in spite of his riches, he were still brave.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To this, for any other but
D'Artagnan, the events of the Place de Gr&egrave;ve might have
served as a reply.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Many
consciences would have been satisfied with them, but D'Artagnan
was brave enough to ask himself sincerely and conscientiously if
he were brave.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Therefore
to this: -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But it appears to me
that I drew promptly enough, and cut and thrust pretty freely on
the Place de Gr&egrave;ve, to be satisfied of my bravery,"
D'Artagnan had himself replied.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Gently, captain, that is not an
answer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I was brave that
day, because they were burning my house, and there are a hundred,
and even a thousand, to speak against one, that if those
gentlemen of the riots had not formed that unlucky idea, their
plan of attack would have succeeded, or, at least, it would not
have been I who would have opposed myself to it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now, what will be brought against
me?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have no house to be
burnt in Bretagne; I have no treasure there that can be taken
from me. - No; but I have my skin; that precious skin of M.
d'Artagnan, which to him is worth more than all the houses and
all the treasures of the world.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That skin to which I cling above
everything, because it is, everything considered, the binding of
a body which encloses a heart very warm and ready to fight, and,
consequently, to live.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Then, I do desire to live: and, in reality, I live much better,
more completely, since I have become rich.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Who the devil ever said that money
spoiled life?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Upon my
soul, it is no such thing, on the contrary, it seems as if I
absorbed a double quantity of air and sun.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mordioux!</i> what will it be then,
if I double that fortune; and if, instead of the switch I now
hold in my hand, I should ever carry the b&acirc;ton of a
mar&eacute;chal?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then I
really don't know if there will be, from that moment, enough of
air and sun for me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In
fact, this is not a dream, who the devil would oppose it, if the
king made me a mar&eacute;chal, as his father, King Louis XIII.,
made a duke and constable of Albert de Luynes?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Am I not as brave, and much more
intelligent, than that imbecile De Vitry?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Ah! that's exactly what will prevent
my advancement: I have too much wit.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Luckily, if there is any justice in
this world, fortune owes me many compensations.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She owes me certainly a recompense
for all I did for Anne of Austria, and an indemnification for all
she has not done for me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Then, at the present, I am very well with a king, and with a king
who has the appearance of determining to reign.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> May God keep him in that illustrious
road!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> For, if he is
resolved to reign, he will want me; and if he wants me, he will
give me what he has promised me - warmth and light; so that I
march, comparatively, now, as I marched formerly, - from nothing
to everything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Only the
nothing of to-day is the all of former days; there has only this
little change taken place in my life.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And now let us see! let us take the
part of the heart, as I just now was speaking of it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But in truth, I only spoke of it
from memory."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And the
Gascon applied his hand to his breast, as if he were actually
seeking the place where his heart was.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! wretch!" murmured
he, smiling with bitterness.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Ah! poor mortal species!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You hoped, for an instant,
that you had not a heart, and now you find you have one - bad
courtier as thou art, - and even one of the most seditious.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You have a heart which speaks
to you in favor of M. Fouquet.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And what is M. Fouquet, when the
king is in question? - A conspirator, a real conspirator, who did
not even give himself the trouble to conceal his being a
conspirator; therefore, what a weapon would you not have against
him, if his good grace, and his intelligence had not made a
scabbard for that weapon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
An armed revolt! - for, in fact, M. Fouquet has been guilty of an
armed revolt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Thus, while
the king vaguely suspects M. Fouquet of rebellion, I know it - I
could prove that M. Fouquet had caused the shedding of the blood
of his majesty's subjects.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now, then, let us see.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Knowing all that, and holding my
tongue, what further would this heart wish in return for a kind
action of M. Fouquet's, for an advance of fifteen thousand
livres, for a diamond worth a thousand pistoles, for a smile in
which there was as much bitterness as kindness? - I save his
life."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Now, then, I hope,"
continued the musketeer, "that this imbecile of a heart is going
to preserve silence, and so be fairly quits with M. Fouquet.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now, then, the king becomes my
sun, and as my heart is quits with M. Fouquet, let him beware who
places himself between me and my sun!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Forward, for his majesty Louis XIV.!
- Forward !"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> These reflections were
the only impediments which were able to retard the progress of
D'Artagnan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> These
reflections once made, he increased the speed of his horse.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But, however perfect his horse
Zephyr might be, it could not hold out at such a pace
forever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The day after
his departure from Paris, his mount was left at Chartres, at the
house of an old friend D'Artagnan had met with in an <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>h&ocirc;telier</i> of that
city.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> From that moment
the musketeer travelled on post-horses.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Thanks to this mode of locomotion,
he traversed the space separating Chartres from
Ch&acirc;teaubriand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In
the last of these two cities, far enough from the coast to
prevent any one guessing that D'Artagnan wished to reach the sea
- far enough from Paris to prevent all suspicion of his being a
messenger from Louis XIV., whom D'Artagnan had called his sun,
without suspecting that he who was only at present a rather poor
star in the heaven of royalty, would, one day, make that star his
emblem; the messenger of Louis XIV., we say, quitted his post and
purchased a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bidet</i> of
the meanest appearance, - one of those animals which an officer
of the cavalry would never choose, for fear of being
disgraced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Excepting the
color, this new acquisition recalled to the mind of D'Artagnan
the famous orange-colored horse, with which, or rather upon
which, he had made his first appearance in the world.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Truth to say, from the moment he
crossed this new steed, it was no longer D'Artagnan who was
travelling, - it was a good man clothed in an iron-gray <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>justaucorps</i>, brown <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>haut-de-chausses</i>, holding the
medium between a priest and a layman; that which brought him
nearest to the churchman was, that D'Artagnan had placed on his
head a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>calotte</i> of
threadbare velvet, and over the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>calotte</i>, a large black hat; no
more sword, a stick hung by a cord to his wrist, but to which, he
promised himself, as an unexpected auxiliary, to join, upon
occasion, a good dagger, ten inches long, concealed under his
cloak.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bidet</i> purchased at
Ch&acirc;teaubriand completed the metamorphosis; it was called,
or rather D'Artagnan called if, Furet (ferret).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "If I have changed
Zephyr into Furet," said D'Artagnan, "I must make some diminutive
or other of my own name.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
So, instead of D'Artagnan, I will be Agnan, short; that is a
concession which I naturally owe to my gray coat, my round hat,
and my rusty <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>calotte</i>."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Monsieur d'Artagnan
traveled, then, pretty easily upon Furet, who ambled like a true
butter-woman's pad, and who, with his amble, managed cheerfully
about twelve leagues a day, upon four spindle-shanks, of which
the practiced eye of D'Artagnan had appreciated the strength and
safety beneath the thick mass of hair which covered them.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Jogging along, the traveler
took notes, studied the country, which he traversed reserved and
silent, ever seeking the most plausible pretext for reaching
Belle-&Icirc;le-en-Mer, and for seeing everything without
arousing suspicion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In
this manner, he was enabled to convince himself of the importance
the event assumed in proportion as he drew near to it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In this remote country, in
this ancient duchy of Bretagne, which was not France at that
period, and is not so even now, the people knew nothing of the
king of France.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They not
only did not know him, but were unwilling to know him.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> One face - a single one -
floated visibly for them upon the political current.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Their ancient dukes no longer ruled
them; government was a void - nothing more.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In place of the sovereign duke, the
seigneurs of parishes reigned without control; and, above these
seigneurs, God, who has never been forgotten in Bretagne.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Among these suzerains of
ch&acirc;teaux and belfries, the most powerful, the richest, the
most popular, was M. Fouquet, seigneur of Belle-Isle.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Even in the country, even within
sight of that mysterious isle, legends and traditions consecrate
its wonders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Every one
might not penetrate it: the isle, of an extent of six leagues in
length, and six in breadth, was a seignorial property, which the
people had for a long time respected, covered as it was with the
name of Retz, so redoubtable in the country.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Shortly after the erection of this
seignory into a marquistate, Belle-Isle passed to M.
Fouquet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The celebrity of
the isle did not date from yesterday; its name, or rather its
qualification, is traced back to the remotest antiquity.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The ancients called it
Kalon&egrave;se, from two Greek words, signifying beautiful
isle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Thus, at a distance
of eighteen hundred years, it had borne, in another idiom, the
same name it still bears.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
There was, then, something in itself in this property of M.
Fouquet's, besides its position of six leagues off the coast of
France; a position which makes it a sovereign in its maritime
solitude, like a majestic ship which disdains roads, and proudly
casts anchor in mid-ocean.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan learnt all
this without appearing the least in the world astonished.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He also learnt the best way to
get intelligence was to go to La Roche-Bernard, a tolerably
important city at the mouth of the Vilaine.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Perhaps there he could embark; if
not, crossing the salt marshes, he would repair to
Gu&eacute;rande or Le Croisic, to wait for an opportunity to
cross over to Belle-Isle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
He had discovered, besides, since his departure from
Ch&acirc;teaubriand, that nothing would be impossible for Furet
under the impulsion of M. Agnan, and nothing to M. Agnan through
the initiative of Furet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
He prepared, then, to sup off a teal and a <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>torteau</i>, in a hotel of La
Roche-Bernard, and ordered to be brought from the cellar, to wash
down these two Breton dishes, some cider, which, the moment it
touched his lips, he perceived to be more Breton still.</p>

B</span>efore taking his place at table, D'Artagnan acquired, as
was his custom, all the information he could; but it is an axiom
of curiosity, that every man who wishes to question well and
fruitfully ought in the first place to lay himself open to
questions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan
sought, then, with his usual skill, a promising questioner in the
hostelry of La Roche-Bernard.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the moment, there were in the
house, on the first story, two travelers either preparing for
supper, or at supper itself.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan had seen their nags in
the stable, and their equipages in the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>salle</i>.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> One traveled with a lackey,
undoubtedly a person of consideration; - two Perche mares, sleek,
sound beasts, were suitable means of locomotion.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The other, a little fellow, a
traveler of meagre appearance, wearing a dusty surtout, dirty
linen, and boots more worn by the pavement than the stirrup, had
come from Nantes with a cart drawn by a horse so like Furet in
color, that D'Artagnan might have gone a hundred miles without
finding a better match.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
This cart contained divers large packets wrapped in pieces of old
stuff.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That traveler yonder,"
said D'Artagnan to himself, "is the man for my money.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He will do, he suits me; I ought to
do for him and suit him; M. Agnan, with the gray doublet and the
rusty <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>calotte</i>, is not
unworthy of supping with the gentleman of the old boots and still
older horse."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This said, D'Artagnan
called the host, and desired him to send his teal, <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>tourteau</i>, and cider up to the
chamber of the gentleman of modest exterior.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He himself climbed, a plate in his
hand, the wooden staircase which led to the chamber, and began to
knock at the door.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Come in!" said the
unknown.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan
entered, with a simper on his lips, his plate under his arm, his
hat in one hand, his candle in the other.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Excuse me, monsieur,"
said he, "I am as you are, a traveler; I know no one in the
hotel, and I have the bad habit of losing my spirits when I eat
alone; so that my repast appears a bad one to me, and does not
nourish me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Your face,
which I saw just now, when you came down to have some oysters
opened, - your face pleased me much.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Besides, I have observed you have a
horse just like mine, and that the host, no doubt on account of
that resemblance, has placed them side by side in the stable,
where they appear to agree amazingly well together.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I therefore, monsieur, do not see
any reason why the masters should be separated when the horses
are united.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Accordingly,
I am come to request the pleasure of being admitted to your
table.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> My name is Agnan,
at your service, monsieur, the unworthy steward of a rich
seigneur, who wishes to purchase some salt-mines in this country,
and sends me to examine his future acquisitions.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In truth, monsieur, I should be well
pleased if my countenance were as agreeable to you as yours is to
me; for, upon my honor, I am quite at your service."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The stranger, whom
D'Artagnan saw for the first time, - for before he had only
caught a glimpse of him, - the stranger had black and brilliant
eyes, a yellow complexion, a brow a little wrinkled by the weight
of fifty years, <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bonhomie</i> in his features
collectively, but some cunning in his look.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "One would say," thought
D'Artagnan, "that this merry fellow has never exercised more than
the upper part of his head, his eyes, and his brain.<span style=

mouth, nose, and chin signify absolutely nothing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur," replied the
latter, with whose mind and person we have been making so free,
"you do me much honor; not that I am ever <i style=

added he, smiling, "a company which amuses me always: but, never
mind that, I am happy to receive you."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But when saying this, the man with
the worn boots cast an uneasy look at his table, from which the
oysters had disappeared, and upon which there was nothing left
but a morsel of salt bacon.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur," D'Artagnan
hastened to say, "the host is bringing me up a pretty piece of
roasted poultry and a superb <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>tourteau</i>."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan had read in the look of
his companion, however rapidly it disappeared, the fear of an
attack by a parasite: he divined justly.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At this opening, the features of the
man of modest exterior relaxed; and, as if he had watched the
moment for his entrance, as D'Artagnan spoke, the host appeared,
bearing the announced dishes.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>tourteau</i> and the teal were added
to the morsel of broiled bacon; D'Artagnan and his guest bowed,
sat down opposite to each other, and, like two brothers, shared
the bacon and the other dishes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur," said
D'Artagnan, "you must confess that association is a wonderful
thing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

stranger, with his mouth full.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

replied D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

short truce to the movement of his jaws, in order to hear the
better.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In the first place,"
continued D'Artagnan, "instead of one candle, which each of us
had, we have two."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is true!" said the
stranger, struck with the extreme lucidity of the
observation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Then I see that you eat
my <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>tourteau</i> in
preference, whilst I, in preference, eat your bacon."</p>

again."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

to being better lighted and eating what we prefer, I place the
pleasure of your company."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

are very jovial," said the unknown, cheerfully.</p>

blushing, "celebrated, monsieur, celebrated is not the word."</p>

with a character of blunt <i style=

the name of your works, monsieur; for you will please to observe
you have not told me your name, and I have been forced to divine
your genius."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My name is Jupenet,
monsieur," said the author.</p>

somewhere."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I have made verses,"
said the poet, modestly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

have heard them read."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

played."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

and said: "I do not think that can be the case, for my verses
have never been printed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, then, it must
have been the tragedy which informed me of your name."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are again mistaken,
for MM. the comedians of the H&ocirc;tel de Bourgogne, would have
nothing to do with it," said the poet, with a smile, the receipt
for which certain sorts of pride alone knew the secret.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan bit his lips.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Thus, then, you see,
monsieur," continued the poet, "you are in error on my account,

being known as those of MM. Corneille, or Rotrou, or
Garnier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I hope,
monsieur, you will have the goodness to repeat to me a part of
your tragedy presently, by way of dessert, for instance.<span

meat, - <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mordioux!</i><span

was a little oath which escaped me, because it is a habit with my
lord and master.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I
sometimes allow myself to usurp that little oath, as it seems in
pretty good taste.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I take
this liberty only in his absence, please to observe, for you may
understand that in his presence - but, in truth, monsieur, this
cider is abominable; do you not think so?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And besides, the pot is of such an
irregular shape it will not stand on the table."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

it level?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And the poet rummaged in
his pocket, and drew out a piece of brass, oblong, quadrangular,
about a line in thickness, and an inch and a half in length.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But scarcely had this little
piece of brass seen the light, than the poet appeared to have
committed an imprudence, and made a movement to put it back again
in his pocket.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan
perceived this, for he was a man that nothing escaped.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He stretched forth his hand
towards the piece of brass: "Humph! that which you hold in your
hand is pretty; will you allow me to look at it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Certainly," said the
poet, who appeared to have yielded too soon to a first
impulse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Certainly, you
may look at it: but it will be in vain for you to look at it,"
added he, with a satisfied air; "if I were not to tell you its
use, you would never guess it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan had seized as
an avowal the hesitation of the poet, and his eagerness to
conceal the piece of brass which a first movement had induced him
to take out of his pocket.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His attention, therefore, once
awakened on this point, he surrounded himself with a
circumspection which gave him a superiority on all
occasions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Besides,
whatever M. Jupenet might say about it, by a simple inspection of
the object, he perfectly well knew what it was.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was a character in printing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Can you guess, now,
what this is?" continued the poet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

"no, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ma foi!</i>"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

going to say something stupid."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Jupenet, with a patronizing air.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

comprehend, if that is a letter, how you can make a word."</p>

absorbed in observations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Jupenet drew from his pocket seven or eight other pieces of brass
smaller than the first.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

gives me the heartburn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Allow me to inquire of your host if there is not a good bottle of
Beaugency, or of the Ceran growth, at the back of the large bins
in his cellar."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

for, immediately attended.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur," interrupted
the poet, "take care, we shall not have time to drink the wine,
unless we make great haste, for I must take advantage of the tide
to secure the boat."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What boat?" asked
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

out for Belle-Isle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

plenty of time, monsieur," replied the <i style=

bottle, "the boat will not leave this hour."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But who will give me
notice?" said the poet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your fellow-traveler,"
replied the host.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "When you hear him
departing, it will be time for you to go."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Is he going to
Belle-Isle, likewise, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The traveler who has a
lackey?" asked D'Artagnan.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "He is some gentleman, no
doubt?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I know nothing of
him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

he is drinking the same wine as you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Peste!</i> - that is a great honor
for us," said D'Artagnan, filling his companion's glass, whilst
the host went out.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "So," resumed the poet,
returning to his dominant ideas, "you never saw any printing
done?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Never."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, then, take the
letters thus, which compose the word, you see: A B; <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ma foi!</i> here is an R, two E E,
then a G."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he
assembled the letters with a swiftness and skill which did not
escape the eye of D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Abr&eacute;g&eacute;</i>," said he,
as he ended.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Good!" said D'Artagnan;
"here are plenty of letters got together; but how are they kept
so?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he poured out a
second glass for the poet.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M. Jupenet smiled like a man who has
an answer for everything; then he pulled out - still from his
pocket - a little metal ruler, composed of two parts, like a
carpenter's rule, against which he put together, and in a line,
the characters, holding them under his left thumb.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And what do you call
that little metal ruler?" said D'Artagnan, "for, I suppose, all
these things have names."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "This is called a
composing-stick," said Jupenet; "it is by the aid of this stick
that the lines are formed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Come, then, I was not
mistaken in what I said; you have a press in your pocket," said
D'Artagnan, laughing with an air of simplicity so stupid, that
the poet was completely his dupe.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No," replied he; "but I
am too lazy to write, and when I have a verse in my head, I print
it immediately.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That is a
labor spared."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mordioux!</i>" thought D'Artagnan to
himself, "this must be cleared up."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And under a pretext, which did not
embarrass the musketeer, who was fertile in expedients, he left
the table, went downstairs, ran to the shed under which stood the
poet's little cart, and poked the point of his poniard into the
stuff which enveloped one of the packages, which he found full of
types, like those which the poet had in his pocket.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Humph!" said
D'Artagnan, "I do not yet know whether M. Fouquet wishes to
fortify Belle-Isle; but, at all events, here are some spiritual
munitions for the castle."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then, enchanted with his rich
discovery, he ran upstairs again, and resumed his place at the
table.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan had learnt
what he wished to know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
He, however, remained, none the less, face to face with his
partner, to the moment when they heard from the next room
symptoms of a person's being about to go out.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The printer was immediately on foot;
he had given orders for his horse to be got ready.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His carriage was waiting at the
door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The second traveler
got into his saddle, in the courtyard, with his lackey.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan followed Jupenet to
the door; he embarked his cart and horse on board the boat.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As to the opulent traveler, he
did the same with his two horses and servant.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But all the wit D'Artagnan employed
in endeavoring to find out his name was lost - he could learn
nothing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Only he took
such notice of his countenance, that it was impressed upon his
mind forever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan
had a great inclination to embark with the two travelers, but an
interest more powerful than curiosity - that of success -
repelled him from the shore, and brought him back again to the
hostelry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He entered with
a sigh, and went to bed directly in order to be ready early in
the morning with fresh ideas and the sage counsel of sufficing
sleep.</p>

A</span>t daybreak D'Artagnan saddled Furet, who had fared
sumptuously all night, devouring the remainder of the oats and
hay left by his companions.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The musketeer sifted all he possibly
could out of the host, who he found cunning, mistrustful, and
devoted, body and soul, to M. Fouquet.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In order not to awaken the
suspicions of this man, he carried on his fable of being a
probable purchaser of some salt-mines.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To have embarked for Belle-Isle at
Roche-Bernard, would have been to expose himself still further to
comments which had, perhaps, been already made, and would be
carried to the castle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Moreover, it was singular that this traveler and his lackey
should have remained a mystery to D'Artagnan, in spite of all the
questions addressed by him to the host, who appeared to know him
perfectly well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
musketeer then made some inquiries concerning the salt-mines, and
took the road to the marshes, leaving the sea on his right, and
penetrating into that vast and desolate plain which resembles a
sea of mud, of which, here and there, a few crests of salt silver
the undulations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Furet
walked admirably, with his little nervous legs, along the
foot-wide causeways which separate the salt-mines.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan, aware of the
consequences of a fall, which would result in a cold bath,
allowed him to go as he liked, contenting himself with looking
at, on the horizon, three rocks, that rose up like lance-blades
from the bosom of the plain, destitute of verdure.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Piriac, the bourgs of Batz and Le
Croisic, exactly resembling each other, attracted and suspended
his attention.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If the
traveler turned round, the better to make his observations, he
saw on the other side an horizon of three other steeples,
Gu&eacute;rande, Le Pouliguen, and Saint-Joachim, which, in their
circumference, represented a set of skittles, of which he and
Furet were but the wandering ball.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Piriac was the first little port on
his right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He went
thither, with the names of the principal salters on his
lips.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the moment he
reached the little port of Piriac, five large barges, laden with
stone, were leaving it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
It appeared strange to D'Artagnan, that stones should be leaving
a country where none are found.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had recourse to all the amenity
of M. Agnan to learn from the people of the port the cause of
this singular arrangement.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> An old fisherman replied to M.
Agnan, that the stones very certainly did not come from Piriac or
the marshes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Where do they come
from, then?" asked the musketeer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur, they come
from Nantes and Paimb&oelig;uf."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Where are they going,
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur, to
Belle-Isle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! ah!" said
D'Artagnan, in the same tone he had assumed to tell the printer
that his character interested him; "are they building at
Belle-Isle, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why, yes, monsieur, M.
Fouquet has the walls of the castle repaired every year."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is in ruins,
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is old."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Thank you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The fact is," said
D'Artagnan to himself, "nothing is more natural; every proprietor
has a right to repair his own property.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It would be like telling me I was
fortifying the Image-de-Notre-Dame, when I was simply obliged to
make repairs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In good
truth, I believe false reports have been made to his majesty, and
he is very likely to be in the wrong."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You must confess,"
continued he then, aloud, and addressing the fisherman - for his
part of a suspicious man was imposed upon him by the object even
of his mission - "you must confess, my dear monsieur, that these
stones travel in a very curious fashion."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "How so?" said the
fisherman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "They come from Nantes
or Paimb&oelig;uf by the Loire, do they not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "With the tide."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is convenient, - I
don't say it is not; but why do they not go straight from
Saint-Nazaire to Belle-Isle?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Eh! because the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>chalands</i> (barges) are
fresh-water boats, and take the sea badly," replied the
fisherman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is not sufficient
reason."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Pardon me, monsieur,
one may see that you have never been a sailor," added the
fisherman, not without a sort of disdain.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Explain to me, if you
please, my good man.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It
appears to me that to come from Paimb&oelig;uf to Piriac, and go
from Piriac to Belle-Isle, is as if we went from Roche-Bernard to
Nantes, and from Nantes to Piriac."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "By water that would be
the nearest way," replied the fisherman imperturbably.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But there is an
elbow?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The fisherman shook his
head.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The shortest road from
one place to another is a straight line," continued
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You forget the tide,
monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well! take the
tide."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And the wind."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, and the
wind."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Without doubt; the
current of the Loire carries barks almost as far as Le
Croisic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If they want to
lie by a little, or to refresh the crew, they come to Piriac
along the coast; from Piriac they find another inverse current,
which carries them to the Isle-Dumal, two leagues and a
half."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Granted."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "There the current of
the Vilaine throws them upon another isle, the Isle of
Hoedic."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I agree with that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, monsieur, from
that isle to Belle-Isle the way is quite straight.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The sea, broken both above and
below, passes like a canal - like a mirror between the two isles;
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>chalands</i> glide
along upon it like ducks upon the Loire; that's how it is."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It does not signify,"
said the obstinate M. Agnan; "it is a long way round."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! yes; but M. Fouquet
will<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> have it so,"
replied, as conclusive, the fisherman, taking off his woolen cap
at the enunciation of that respected name.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> A look from D'Artagnan,
a look as keen and piercing as a sword-blade, found nothing in
the heart of the old man but a simple confidence - on his
features, nothing but satisfaction and indifference.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He said, "M. Fouquet will have it
so," as he would have said, "God has willed it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan had already
advanced too far in this direction; besides, the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>chalands</i> being gone, there
remained nothing at Piriac but a single bark - that of the old
man, and it did not look fit for sea without great
preparation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan
therefore patted Furet, who, as a new proof of his charming
character, resumed his march with his feet in the salt-mines, and
his nose to the dry wind, which bends the furze and the broom of
this country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They
reached Le Croisic about five o'clock.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> If D'Artagnan had been a
poet, it was a beautiful spectacle: the immense strand of a
league or more, the sea covers at high tide, and which, at the
reflux, appears gray and desolate, strewed with polypi and
seaweed, with pebbles sparse and white, like bones in some vast
old cemetery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But the
soldier, the politician, and the ambitious man, had no longer the
sweet consolation of looking towards heaven to read there a hope
or a warning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A red sky
signifies nothing to such people but wind and disturbance.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> White and fleecy clouds upon
the azure only say that the sea will be smooth and peaceful.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan found the sky blue,
the breeze embalmed with saline perfumes, and he said: "I will
embark with the first tide, if it be but in a nutshell."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> At Le Croisic as at
Piriac, he had remarked enormous heaps of stone lying along the
shore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> These gigantic
walls, diminished every tide by the barges for Belle-Isle, were,
in the eyes of the musketeer, the consequence and the proof of
what he had well divined at Piriac.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Was it a wall that M. Fouquet was
constructing?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Was it a
fortification that he was erecting?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To ascertain that, he must make
fuller observations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan put Furet into a stable; supped, went to bed, and on
the morrow took a walk upon the port or rather upon the
shingle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Le Croisic has a
port of fifty feet; it has a look-out which resembles an enormous
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>brioche</i> (a kind of
cake) elevated on a dish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The flat strand is the dish.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Hundreds of barrowsful of earth
amalgamated with pebbles, and rounded into cones, with sinuous
passages between, are look-outs and <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>brioches</i> at the same time.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is so now, and it was so
two hundred years ago, only the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>brioche</i> was not so large, and
probably there were to be seen to trellises of lath around the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>brioche</i>, which constitute
an ornament, planted like <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>gardes-fous</i> along the passages
that wind towards the little terrace.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Upon the shingle lounged three or
four fishermen talking about sardines and shrimps.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan, with his eyes animated
by a rough gayety, and a smile upon his lips, approached these
fishermen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Any fishing going on
to-day?" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, monsieur," replied
one of them, "we are only waiting for the tide."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Where do you fish, my
friends?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Upon the coasts,
monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Which are the best
coasts?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah, that is all
according.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The tour of
the isles, for example?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, but they are a
long way off, those isles, are they not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Not very; four
leagues."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Four leagues!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That is a voyage."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The fishermen laughed in
M. Agnan's face.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Hear me, then," said
the latter with an air of simple stupidity; "four leagues off you
lose sight of land, do you not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why, not always."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah, it is a long way -
too long, or else I would have asked you to take me aboard, and
to show me what I have never seen."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What is that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A live sea-fish."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur comes from the
province?" said a fisherman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, I come from
Pairs."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The Breton shrugged his
shoulders; then:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Have you ever seen M.
Fouquet in Paris?" asked he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Often," replied
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Often!" repeated the
fishermen, closing their circle round the Parisian.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Do you know him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A little; he is the
intimate friend of my master."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!" said the
fishermen, in astonishment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And," said D'Artagnan,
"I have seen all his ch&acirc;teaux of Saint Mand&eacute;, of
Vaux, and his hotel in Paris."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Is that a fine
place?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Superb."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is not so fine a
place as Belle-Isle," said the fisherman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Bah!" cried M.
d'Artagnan, breaking into a laugh so loud that he angered all his
auditors.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is very plain that
you have never seen Belle-Isle," said the most curious of the
fishermen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Do you know
that there are six leagues of it, and that there are such trees
on it as cannot be equaled even at
Nates-sur-le-Foss&eacute;?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Trees in the sea!"
cried D'Artagnan; "well, I should like to see them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That can be easily
done; we are fishing at the Isle de Hoedic - come with us.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> From that place you will see,
as a Paradise, the black trees of Belle-Isle against the sky; you
will see the white line of the castle, which cuts the horizon of
the sea like a blade."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh," said D'Artagnan,
"that must be very beautiful.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But do you know there are a hundred
belfries at M. Fouquet's ch&acirc;teau of Vaux?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The Breton raised his
head in profound admiration, but he was not convinced.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "A hundred belfries!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Ah, that may be; but
Belle-Isle is finer than that.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Should you like to see
Belle-Isle?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Is that possible?"
asked D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, with permission of
the governor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But I do not know the
governor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "As you know M. Fouquet,
you can tell your name."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, my friends, I am
not a gentleman."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Everybody enters
Belle-Isle," continued the fisherman in his strong, pure
language, "provided he means no harm to Belle-Isle or its
master."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> A slight shudder crept
over the body of the musketeer.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "That is true," thought he.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then recovering himself, "If I
were sure," said he, "not to be sea-sick."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What, upon <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>her?</i>" said the fisherman,
pointing with pride to his pretty round-bottomed bark</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, you almost
persuade me," cried M. Agnan; "I will go and see Belle-Isle, but
they will not admit me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "We shall enter, safe
enough."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What for?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why, <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>dame!</i> to sell fish to the
corsairs."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ha!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Corsairs - what do you mean?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, I mean that M.
Fouquet is having two corsairs built to chase the Dutch and the
English, and we sell our fish to the crews of those little
vessels."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Come, come!" said
D'Artagnan to himself - "better and better.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A printing-press, bastions, and
corsairs!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well, M.
Fouquet is not an enemy to be despised, as I presumed to
fancy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He is worth the
trouble of travelling to see him nearer."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "We set out at half-past
five," said the fisherman gravely.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am quite ready, and I
will not leave you now."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
So D'Artagnan saw the fishermen haul their barks to meet the tide
with a windlass.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The sea
rose; M. Agnan allowed himself to be hoisted on board, not
without sporting a little fear and awkwardness, to the amusement
of the young beach-urchins who watched him with their large
intelligent eyes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He laid
himself down upon a folded sail, not interfering with anything
whilst the bark prepared for sea; and, with its large square
sail, it was fairly out within two hours.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The fishermen, who prosecuted their
occupation as they proceeded, did not perceive that their
passenger had<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> not become
pale, neither groaned nor suffered; that in spite of that
horrible tossing and rolling of the bark, to which no hand
imparted direction, the novice passenger had preserved his
presence of mind and his appetite.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They fished, and their fishing was
sufficiently fortunate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
To lines bated with prawn, soles came, with numerous gambols, to
bite.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Two nets had
already been broken by the immense weight of congers and
haddocks; three sea-eels plowed the hold with their slimy folds
and their dying contortions.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan brought them good luck;
they told him so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
soldier found the occupation so pleasant, that he put his hand to
the work - that is to say, to the lines - and uttered roars of
joy, and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mordioux</i>
enough to have astonished his musketeers themselves, every time
that a shock given to his line by the captured fish required the
play of the muscles of his arm, and the employment of his best
dexterity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The party of
pleasure had made him forget his diplomatic mission.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was struggling with a very large
conger, and holding fast with one hand to the side of the vessel,
in order to seize with the other the gaping jowl of his
antagonist, when the master said to him, "Take care they don't
see you from Belle-Isle!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> These words produced the
same effect upon D'Artagnan as the hissing of the first bullet on
a day of battle; he let go of both line and conger, which,
dragging each other, returned again to the water.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan perceived, within half a
league at most, the blue and marked profile of the rocks of
Belle-Isle, dominated by the majestic whiteness of the
castle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the distance,
the land with its forests and verdant plains; cattle on the
grass.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This was what
first attracted the attention of the musketeer.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The sun darted its rays of gold upon
the sea, raising a shining mist round this enchanted isle.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Little could be seen of it,
owing to this dazzling light, but the salient points; every
shadow was strongly marked, and cut with bands of darkness the
luminous fields and walls.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Eh! eh!" said D'Artagnan, at the
aspect of those masses of black rocks, "these are fortifications
which do not stand in need of any engineer to render a landing
difficult.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> How the devil
can a landing be effected on that isle which God has defended so
completely?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "This way," replied the
patron of the bark, changing the sail, and impressing upon the
rudder a twist which turned the boat in the direction of a pretty
little port, quite coquettish, round, and newly battlemented.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What the devil do I see
yonder?" said D'Artagnan.</p>

T</span>here is always something in a landing, if it be only from
the smallest sea-boat - a trouble and a confusion which do not
leave the mind the liberty of which it stands in need in order to
study at the first glance the new locality presented to it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The moveable bridges, the
agitated sailors, the noise of the water on the pebbles, the
cries and importunities of those who wait upon the shores, are
multiplied details of that sensation which is summed up in one
single result - hesitation.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was not, then, till after
standing several minutes on the shore that D'Artagnan saw upon
the port, but more particularly in the interior of the isle, an
immense number of workmen in motion.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At his feet D'Artagnan recognized
the five <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>chalands</i> laden
with rough stone he had seen leave the port of Piriac.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The smaller stones were
transported to the shore by means of a chain formed by
twenty-five or thirty peasants.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The large stones were loaded on
trollies which conveyed them in the same direction as the others,
that is to say, towards the works, of which D'Artagnan could as
yet appreciate neither the strength nor the extent.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Everywhere was to be seen an
activity equal to that which Telemachus observed on his landing
at Salentum.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan
felt a strong inclination to penetrate into the interior; but he
could not, under the penalty of exciting mistrust, exhibit too
much curiosity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He
advanced then little by little, scarcely going beyond the line
formed by the fishermen on the beach, observing everything,
saying nothing, and meeting all suspicion that might have been
excited with a half-silly question or a polite bow.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And yet, whilst his companions
carried on their trade, giving or selling their fish to the
workmen or the inhabitants of the city, D'Artagnan had gained by
degrees, and, reassured by the little attention paid to him, he
began to cast an intelligent and confident look upon the men and
things that appeared before his eyes.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And his very first glance fell on
certain movements of earth about which the eye of a soldier could
not be mistaken.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the
two extremities of the port, in order that their fires should
converge upon the great axis of the ellipse formed by the basin,
in the first place, two batteries had been raised, evidently
destined to receive flank pieces, for D'Artagnan saw the workmen
finishing the platform and making ready the demi-circumference in
wood upon which the wheels of the pieces might turn to embrace
every direction over the epaulement.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> By the side of each of these
batteries other workmen were strengthening gabions filled with
earth, the lining of another battery.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The latter had embrasures, and the
overseer of the works called successively men who, with cords,
tied the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>saucissons</i> and
cut the lozenges and right angles of turfs destined to retain the
matting of the embrasures.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> By the activity displayed in these
works, already so far advanced, they might be considered as
finished: they were not yet furnished with their cannons, but the
platforms had their <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>g&icirc;tes</i> and their <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>madriers</i> all prepared; the
earth, beaten carefully, was consolidated; and supposing the
artillery to be on the island, in less than two or three days the
port might be completely armed.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That which astonished D'Artagnan,
when he turned his eyes from the coast batteries to the
fortifications of the city, was to see that Belle-Isle was
defended by an entirely new system, of which he had often heard
the Comte de la F&egrave;re speak as a wonderful advance, but of
which he had as yet never seen the application.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> These fortifications belonged
neither to the Dutch method of Marollais, nor to the French
method of the Chevalier Antoine de Ville, but to the system of
Manesson Mallet, a skillful engineer, who about six or eight
years previously had quitted the service of Portugal to enter
that of France.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The works
had this peculiarity, that instead of rising above the earth, as
did the ancient ramparts destined to defend a city from
escalades, they, on the contrary, sank into it; and what created
the height of the walls was the depth of the ditches.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It did not take long to make
D'Artagnan perceive the superiority of such a system, which gives
no advantage to cannon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Besides, as the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>foss&eacute;s</i> were lower than,
or on a level with, the sea, these <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>foss&eacute;s</i> could be
instantly inundated by means of subterranean sluices.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Otherwise, the works were almost
complete, and a group of workmen, receiving orders from a man who
appeared to be conductor of the works, were occupied in placing
the last stones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A bridge
of planks thrown over the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>foss&eacute;s</i> for the greater
convenience of the maneuvers connected with the barrows, joined
the interior to the exterior.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> With an air of simple curiosity
D'Artagnan asked if he might be permitted to cross the bridge,
and he was told that no order prevented it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Consequently he crossed the bridge,
and advanced towards the group.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This group was
superintended by the man whom D'Artagnan had already remarked,
and who appeared to be the engineer-in-chief.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A plan was lying open before him
upon a large stone forming a table, and at some paces from him a
crane was in action.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This
engineer, who by his evident importance first attracted the
attention of D'Artagnan, wore a <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>justaucorps</i>, which, from its
sumptuousness, was scarcely in harmony with the work he was
employed in, that rather necessitated the costume of a
master-mason than of a noble.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was a man of immense stature and
great square shoulders, and wore a hat covered with feathers.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He gesticulated in the
most majestic manner, and appeared, for D'Artagnan only saw his
back, to be scolding the workmen for their idleness and want of
strength.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan continued to
draw nearer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At that
moment the man with the feathers ceased to gesticulate, and, with
his hands placed upon his knees, was following, half-bent, the
effort of six workmen to raise a block of hewn stone to the top
of a piece of timber destined to support that stone, so that the
cord of the crane might be passed under it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The six men, all on one side of the
stone, united their efforts to raise it to eight or ten inches
from the ground, sweating and blowing, whilst a seventh got ready
for when there should be daylight enough beneath it to slide in
the roller that was to support it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But the stone had already twice
escaped from their hands before gaining a sufficient height for
the roller to be introduced.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There can be no doubt that every
time the stone escaped them, they bounded quickly backwards, to
keep their feet from being crushed by the refalling stone.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Every time, the stone,
abandoned by them, sunk deeper into the damp earth, which
rendered the operation more and more difficult.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A third effort was followed by no
better success, but with progressive discouragement.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And yet, when the six men were bent
towards the stone, the man with the feathers had himself, with a
powerful voice, given the word of command, "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ferme!</i>" which regulates
maneuvers of strength.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Then he drew himself up.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! oh!" said he, "what
is this all about?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Have I
to do with men of straw?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Corne de b&oelig;uf!</i>
stand on one side, and you shall see how this is to be done."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Peste!</i>" said D'Artagnan, "will
he pretend to raise that rock? that would be a sight worth
looking at."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The workmen, as
commanded by the engineer, drew back with their ears down, and
shaking their heads, with the exception of the one who held the
plank, who prepared to perform the office.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The man with the feathers went up to
the stone, stooped, slipped his hands under the face lying upon
the ground, stiffened his Herculean muscles, and without a
strain, with a slow motion, like that of a machine, lifted the
end of the rock a foot from the ground.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The workman who held the plank
profited by the space thus given him, and slipped the roller
under the stone.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That's the way," said
the giant, not letting the rock fall again, but placing it upon
its support.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mordioux!</i>" cried D'Artagnan, "I
know but one man capable of such a feat of strength."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hein!</i>" cried the colossus,
turning round.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Porthos!" murmured
D'Artagnan, seized with stupor, "Porthos at Belle-Isle!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> On his part, the man
with the feathers fixed his eyes upon the disguised lieutenant,
and, in spite of his metamorphosis, recognized him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "D'Artagnan!" cried he; and the
color mounted to his face.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Hush!" said he to D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Hush!" in his turn,
said the musketeer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In
fact, if Porthos had just been discovered by D'Artagnan,
D'Artagnan had just been discovered by Porthos.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The interest of the particular
secret of each struck them both at the same instant.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Nevertheless the first movement of
the two men was to throw their arms around each other.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What they wished to conceal
from the bystanders, was not their friendship, but their
names.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But, after the
embrace, came reflection.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What the devil brings
Porthos to Belle-Isle, lifting stones?" said D'Artagnan; only
D'Artagnan uttered that question in a low voice.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Less strong in diplomacy than his
friend, Porthos thought aloud.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "How the devil did you
come to Belle-Isle?" asked he of D'Artagnan; "and what do you
want to do here?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was
necessary to reply without hesitation.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To hesitate in answer to Porthos
would have been a check, for which the self-love of D'Artagnan
would never have consoled itself.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Pardieu!</i> my friend, I am at
Belle-Isle because <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>you</i>
are here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah, bah!" said Porthos,
visibly stupefied with the argument and seeking to account for it
to himself, with the felicity of deduction we know to be
particular to him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Without doubt,"
continued D'Artagnan, unwilling to give his friend time to
recollect himself, "I have been to see you at Pierrefonds."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Indeed!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And you did not find me
there?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Mouston."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

not tell you I was here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

his confidence?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well; that is a reason
at least that does not offend my self-love."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

to find me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My dear friend, a great
noble like you always leaves traced behind him on his passage;

enough to follow the traces of my friends."<span style=

was, did not entirely satisfy Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But I left no traces
behind me, for I came here disguised," said Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And do you think a

to deceive people?"</p>

which served him for eyebrows.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

D'Artagnan, hoping that this reason would mystify Porthos.<span

himself up to a violent mental labor.</p>

inquired where Aramis was, saying to yourself, 'Where Aramis is,
there Porthos will be.'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>

Roche-Bernard, I heard of the splendid fortifications going on at
Belle-Isle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The account
raised my curiosity, I embarked in a fishing boat, without
dreaming that you were here: I came, and I saw a monstrous fine

the stone that served him for a table, and upon which the plan
was spread.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the foot
of the plan was written, in the formidable writing of Porthos,
writing of which we have already had occasion to speak: -</p>

of the square or rectangle, as has been done to this time, you
will suppose your place inclosed in a regular hexagon, this
polygon having the advantage of offering more angles than the
quadrilateral one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Every
side of your hexagon, of which you will determine the length in
proportion to the dimensions taken upon the place, will be
divided into two parts, and upon the middle point you will
elevate a perpendicular towards the center of the polygon, which
will equal in length the sixth part of the side.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> By the extremities of each side of
the polygon, you will trace two diagonals, which will cut the
perpendicular.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> These will
form the precise lines of your defense."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The devil!" said
D'Artagnan, stopping at this point of the demonstration; "why,
this is a complete system, Porthos."</p>

Porthos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Continue."</p>

the stone.</p>

time he had the plan in his hands, D'Artagnan had been able to

Michon, with which he had been acquainted in his youth.<span

T</span>he passage from Belle-Isle to Sarzeau was made rapidly
enough, thanks to one of those little corsairs of which
D'Artagnan had been told during his voyage, and which, shaped for
fast sailing and destined for the chase, were sheltered at that
time in the roadstead of Locmaria, where one of them, with a
quarter of its war-crew, performed duty between Belle-Isle and
the continent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan
had an opportunity of convincing himself that Porthos, though
engineer and topographer, was not deeply versed in affairs of
state.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His perfect
ignorance, with any other, might have passed for well-informed
dissimulation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But
D'Artagnan knew too well all the folds and refolds of his
Porthos, not to find a secret if there were one there; like those
regular, minute old bachelors, who know how to find, with their
eyes shut, each book on the shelves of their library and each
piece of linen in their wardrobe.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> So if he had found nothing, our
cunning D'Artagnan, in rolling and unrolling his Porthos, it was
because, in truth, there was nothing to be found.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Be it so," said
D'Artagnan; "I shall get to know more at Vannes in half an hour
than Porthos has discovered at Belle-Isle in two months.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Only, in order that I may know
something, it is important that Porthos should not make use of
the only stratagem I leave at his disposal.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He must not warn Aramis of my
arrival."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> All the care of
the musketeer was then, for the moment, confined to the watching
of Porthos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And let us
hasten to say, Porthos did not deserve all this mistrust.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos thought of no
evil.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Perhaps, on first
seeing him, D'Artagnan had inspired him with a little suspicion;
but almost immediately D'Artagnan had reconquered in that good
and brave heart the place he had always occupied, and not the
least cloud darkened the large eye of Porthos, fixed from time to
time with tenderness on his friend.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> On landing, Porthos
inquired if his horses were waiting and soon perceived them at
the crossing of the road that winds round Sarzeau, and which,
without passing through that little city, leads towards
Vannes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> These horses were
two in number, one for M. de Vallon, and one for his equerry; for
Porthos had an equerry since Mouston was only able to use a
carriage as a means of locomotion.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan expected that Porthos
would propose to send forward his equerry upon one horse to bring
back another, and he - D'Artagnan - had made up his mind to
oppose this proposition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
But nothing D'Artagnan had expected happened.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos simply told the equerry to
dismount and await his return at Sarzeau, whilst D'Artagnan would
ride his horse; which was arranged.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Eh! but you are quite a
man of precaution, my dear Porthos," said D'Artagnan to his
friend, when he found himself in the saddle, upon the equerry's
horse.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes; but this is a
kindness on the part of Aramis.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have not my stud here, and Aramis
has placed his stables at my disposal."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Good horses for
bishop's horses, <i style=

bishop of a peculiar kind."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He is a holy man!"
replied Porthos, in a tone almost nasal, and with his eyes raised
towards heaven.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Then he is much
changed," said D'Artagnan; "you and I have known him passably
profane."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Grace has touched him,"
said Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Bravo," said
D'Artagnan, "that redoubles my desire to see my dear old
friend."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he spurred
his horse, which sprang off into a more rapid pace.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Peste!</i>" said Porthos, "if we go

say, Porthos?"</p>

half."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

weigh?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "So that you must

style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Besides, there are in this
faubourg a mall, a tennis-court, and a house of Dominicans.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Look, that where the handsome
steeple rises to the heavens."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Next, you see the
faubourg is like a separate city, it has its walls, its towers,
its ditches; the quay is upon it likewise, and the boats land at
the quay.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If our little
corsair did not draw eight feet of water, we could have come full
sail up to Aramis's windows."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Porthos, Porthos,"
cried D'Artagnan, "you are a well of knowledge, a spring of
ingenious and profound reflections.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos, you no longer surprise me,
you confound me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Here we are," said
Porthos, turning the conversation with his usual modesty.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And high time we were,"
thought D'Artagnan, "for Aramis's horse is melting away like a
steed of ice."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> They entered almost at
the same instant the faubourg; but scarcely had they gone a
hundred paces when they were surprised to find the streets
strewed with leaves and flowers.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Against the old walls of Vannes,
hung the oldest and the strangest tapestries of France.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> From over balconies fell long
white sheets stuck all over with bouquets.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The streets were deserted; it was
plain the entire population was assembled on one point.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The blinds were closed, and
the breeze penetrated into the houses under the hangings, which
cast long, black shades between their places of issue and the
walls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Suddenly, at the
turning of a street, chants struck the ears of the newly arrived
travelers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A crowd in
holiday garb appeared through the vapors of incense which mounted
to the heavens in blue fleeces, and clouds of rose-leaves
fluttered as high as the first stories.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Above all heads were to be seen the
cross and banners, the sacred symbols of religion.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then, beneath these crosses and
banners, as if protected by them, walked a whole world of young
girls clothed in white, crowned with corn-flowers.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the two sides of the street,
inclosing the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cort&eacute;ge</i>, marched the
guards of the garrison, carrying bouquets in the barrels of their
muskets and on the points of their lances.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This was the procession.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Whilst D'Artagnan and
Porthos were looking on with critical glances, which disguised an
extreme impatience to get forward, a magnificent da&iuml;s
approached preceded by a hundred Jesuits and a hundred
Dominicans, and escorted by two archdeacons, a treasurer, a
penitent and twelve canons.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A singer with a thundering voice - a
man certainly picked out from all the voices of France, as was
the drum-major of the imperial guard from all the giants of the
empire - escorted by four other chanters, who appeared to be
there only to serve him as an accompaniment, made the air
resound, and the windows of the houses vibrate.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Under the da&iuml;s appeared a pale
and noble countenance with black eyes, black hair streaked with
threads of white, a delicate, compressed mouth, a prominent and
angular chin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His head,
full of graceful majesty, was covered with the episcopal mitre, a
headdress which gave it, in addition to the character of
sovereignty, that of asceticism and evangelic meditation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Aramis!" cried the
musketeer, involuntarily, as this lofty countenance passed before
him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The prelate started
at the sound of the voice.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He raised his large black eyes, with
their long lashes, and turned them without hesitation towards the
spot whence the exclamation proceeded.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At a glance, he saw Porthos and
D'Artagnan close to him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
On his part, D'Artagnan, thanks to the keenness of his sight, had
seen all, seized all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
full portrait of the prelate had entered his memory, never to
leave it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> One thing had
particularly struck D'Artagnan.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On perceiving him, Aramis had
colored, then he had concentrated under his eyelids the fire of
the look of the master, and the indefinable affection of the
friend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was evident
that Aramis had asked himself this question: - "Why is D'Artagnan
with Porthos, and what does he want at Vannes?"<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Aramis comprehended all that was
passing in the mind of D'Artagnan, on turning his look upon him
again, and seeing that he had not lowered his eyes.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He knew the acuteness and
intelligence of his friend; he feared to let him divine the
secret of his blush and his astonishment.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was still the same Aramis, always
having a secret to conceal.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Therefore, to put an end to his look
of an inquisitor, which it was necessary to get rid of at all
events, as, at any price, a general extinguishes a battery which
annoys him, Aramis stretched forth his beautiful white hand, upon
which sparkled the amethyst of the pastoral ring; he cut the air
with sign of the cross, and poured out his benediction upon his
two friends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Perhaps
thoughtful and absent, D'Artagnan, impious in spite of himself,
might not have bent beneath this holy benediction; but Porthos
saw his distraction, and laying his friendly hand upon the back
of his companion, he crushed him down towards the earth.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan was forced to give
way; indeed, he was little short of being flat on the
ground.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the meantime
Aramis had passed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan, like Ant&aelig;us, had only touched the ground, and
he turned towards Porthos, almost angry.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But there was no mistaking the
intention of the brave Hercules; it was a feeling of religious
propriety that had influenced him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Besides, speech with Porthos,
instead of disguising his thought, always completed it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is very polite of
him," said he, "to have given his benediction to us alone.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Decidedly, he is a holy man,
and a brave man."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Less
convinced than Porthos, D'Artagnan made no reply.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Observe my friend,"
continued Porthos, "he has seen us; and, instead of continuing to
walk on at the simple pace of the procession, as he did just now,
- see, what a hurry he is in; do you see how the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>cort&eacute;ge</i> is increasing
its speed?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He is eager to
join us and embrace us, is that dear Aramis."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is true," replied
D'Artagnan, aloud. - Then to himself: - "It is equally true he
has seen me, the fox, and will have time to prepare himself to
receive me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> But the procession had
passed; the road was free.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan and Porthos walked
straight up to the episcopal palace, which was surrounded by a
numerous crowd anxious to see the prelate return.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan remarked that this crowd
was composed principally of citizens and military men.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He recognized in the nature of
these partisans the address of his friend.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Aramis was not the man to seek for a
useless popularity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He
cared very little for being beloved by people who could be of no
service to him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Women,
children, and old men, that is to say, the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cort&eacute;ge</i> of ordinary
pastors; was not the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cort&eacute;ge</i> for him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Ten minutes after the
two friends had passed the threshold of the palace, Aramis
returned like a triumphant conqueror; the soldiers presented arms
to him as to a superior; the citizens bowed to him as to a friend
and a patron, rather than as a head of the Church.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There was something in Aramis
resembling those Roman senators who had their doors always
surrounded by clients.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At
the foot of the steps, he had a conference of half a minute with
a Jesuit, who, in order to speak to him more secretly, passed his
head under the da&iuml;s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
He then re-entered his palace; the doors closed slowly, and the
crowd melted away, whilst chants and prayers were still
resounding abroad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was
a magnificent day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Earthly perfumes were mingled with the perfumes of the air and
the sea.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The city
breathed happiness, joy, and strength.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan felt something like the
presence of an invisible hand which had, all-powerfully, created
this strength, this joy, this happiness, and spread everywhere
these perfumes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! oh!" said he,
"Porthos has got fat; but Aramis is grown taller."</p>

P</span>orthos and D'Artagnan had entered the bishop's residence
by a private door, as his personal friends.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Of course, Porthos served D'Artagnan
as guide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The worthy
baron comported himself everywhere rather as if he were at
home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Nevertheless,
whether it was a tacit acknowledgement of the sanctity of the
personage of Aramis and his character, or the habit of respecting
him who imposed upon him morally, a worthy habit which had always
made Porthos a model soldier and an excellent companion; for all
these reasons, say we, Porthos preserved in the palace of His
Greatness the Bishop of Vannes a sort of reserve which D'Artagnan
remarked at once, in the attitude he took with respect to the
valets and officers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And
yet this reserve did not go so far as to prevent his asking
questions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos
questioned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They learned
that His Greatness had just returned to his apartment and was
preparing to appear in familiar intimacy, less majestic than he
had appeared with his flock.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> After a quarter of an hour, which
D'Artagnan and Porthos passed in looking mutually at each other
with the white of their eyes, and turning their thumbs in all the
different evolutions which go from north to south, a door of the
chamber opened and His Greatness appeared, dressed in the
undress, complete, of a prelate.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Aramis carried his head high, like a
man accustomed to command: his violet robe was tucked up on one
side, and his white hand was on his hip.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had retained the fine mustache,
and the lengthened <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>royale</i> of the time of Louis
XIII.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He exhaled, on
entering, that delicate perfume which, among elegant men and
women of high fashion, never changes, and appears to be
incorporated in the person, of whom it has become the natural
emanation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In this case
only, the perfume had retained something of the religious
sublimity of incense.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It
no longer intoxicated, it penetrated; it no longer inspired
desire, it inspired respect.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Aramis, on entering the chamber, did
not hesitate an instant; and without pronouncing one word, which,
whatever it might be, would have been cold on such an occasion,
he went straight up to the musketeer, so well disguised under the
costume of M. Agnan, and pressed him in his arms with a
tenderness which the most distrustful could not have suspected of
coldness or affectation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan, on his part,
embraced him with equal ardor.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos pressed the delicate hand of
Aramis in his immense hands, and D'Artagnan remarked that His
Greatness gave him his left hand, probably from habit, seeing
that Porthos already ten times had been near injuring his fingers
covered with rings, by pounding his flesh in the vise of his
fist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Warned by the pain,
Aramis was cautious, and only presented flesh to be bruised, and
not fingers to be crushed, against the gold or the angles of
diamonds.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Between two embraces,
Aramis looked D'Artagnan in the face, offered him a chair,
sitting down himself in the shade, observing that the light fell
full upon the face of his interlocutor.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This maneuver, familiar to
diplomatists and women, resembles much the advantage of the guard
which, according to their skill or habit, combatants endeavor to
take on the ground at a duel.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan was not the dupe of this
maneuver; but he did not appear to perceive it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He felt himself caught; but,
precisely because he was caught he felt himself on the road to
discovery, and it little imported to him, old condotti&egrave;re
as he was, to be beaten in appearance, provided he drew from his
pretended defeat the advantages of victory.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Aramis began the conversation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! dear friend! my
good D'Artagnan," said he, "what an excellent chance!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is a chance, my
reverend companion," said D'Artagnan, "that I will call
friendship.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I seek you,
as I always have sought you, when I had any grand enterprise to
propose to you, or some hours of liberty to give you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! indeed," said
Aramis, without explosion, "you have been seeking me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Eh! yes, he has been
seeking you, Aramis," said Porthos, "and the proof is that he has
unharbored me at Belle-Isle.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That is amiable, is it not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! yes," said Aramis,
"at Belle-Isle! certainly!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Good!" said D'Artagnan;
"there is my booby Porthos, without thinking of it, has fired the
first cannon of attack."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "At Belle-Isle!" said
Aramis, "in that hole, in that desert!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That is kind, indeed!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And it was I who told
him you were at Vannes," continued Porthos, in the same tone.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan armed his
mouth with a finesse almost ironical.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, I knew, but I was
willing to see," replied he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To see what?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "If our old friendship
still held out; if, on seeing each other, our hearts, hardened as
they are by age, would still let the old cry of joy escape, which
salutes the coming of a friend."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, and you must have
been satisfied," said Aramis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "So, so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "How is that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, Porthos said hush!

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well! and I?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

benediction."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What would you have, my
friend?" said Aramis, smiling; "that is the most precious thing
that a poor prelate, like me, has to give."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Indeed, my dear
friend!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Doubtless."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And yet they say at
Paris that the bishopric of Vannes is one of the best in
France."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! you are now
speaking of temporal wealth," said Aramis, with a careless
air.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To be sure, I wish to
speak of that; I hold by it, on my part."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

speak of it," said Aramis, with a smile.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

one of the richest prelates in France?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My friend, since you
ask me to give you an account, I will tell you that the bishopric
of Vannes is worth about twenty thousand livres a year, neither
more nor less.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is a
diocese which contains a hundred and sixty parishes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is very pretty,"
said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And yet," resumed
D'Artagnan, throwing his eyes over Aramis, "you don't mean to
bury yourself here forever?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My friend, I am getting
old," said Aramis; "the noise and bustle of a city no longer suit
me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At fifty-seven we
ought to seek calm and meditation.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have found them here.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What is there more beautiful, and
stern at the same time, than this old Armorica.<span style=

that is opposite to what I formerly loved, and that is what must
happen at the end of life, which is opposite to the
beginning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A little of my
old pleasure of former times still comes to salute me here, now
and then, without diverting me from the road of salvation.<span

yet every step that I take brings me nearer to God."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

you my congratulations."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

smiling, "you did not come here only for the purpose of paying me
compliments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Speak; what
brings you hither?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> May it
be that, in some fashion or other, you want me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

suspiciously.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He could
not believe - particularly on seeing his friend in such humble
guise - that he had made so fine a fortune.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then D'Artagnan, seeing that the
hour of explanations was come, related the history of his English

his slender fingers work convulsively.<span style=

look, he could not this time support the look of Aramis.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He allowed, therefore, his eye
to stray upon Porthos - like the sword which yields to too
powerful a pressure, and seeks another road.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

the bishop, "you have assumed a singular traveling costume, old

D'Artagnan; "I knew I should find you and Porthos there."</p>

Aramis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Me! for the last

"I should never have supposed you such a housekeeper."</p>

tell you that I am no longer the Aramis of former times.<span

unpleasant to me; the sea fatigues me.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am a poor, ailing priest, always
complaining, always grumbling, and inclined to the austerities
which appear to accord with old age, - preliminary parleyings

dear D'Artagnan, I linger."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, that is all the
better, my friend, for we shall probably be neighbors soon."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

a degree of surprise he did not even seek to dissemble.<span

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

some very profitable salt-mines, which are situated between
Piriac and Le Croisic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Imagine, my dear friend, a clear profit of twelve per cent. <span

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Porthos, as if to ask if all this were true, if some snare were
not concealed beneath this outward indifference.<span style=

consulted this poor auxiliary, he collected all his forces for a
fresh assault and new defense.<span style=

with that famous restoration, when I learned that you had been

an obligation."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But how the devil did
you learn all that?" asked D'Artagnan, who began to fear that the
investigation of Aramis had extended further than he wished.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Dear D'Artagnan," said
the prelate, "my friendship resembles, in a degree, the

a lantern to direct the barks that come from sea.<span style=

interest; he divines them; he calls them; he attracts them into

resemble this watcher; from time to time some news reaches me,
and recalls to my remembrance all those I loved.<span style=

whom God has kindly given the shelter of a sentry-box."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Aramis, "you get beyond my depth.<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

of this riot?" said Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan remarked upon
the face of Aramis a complete indifference to this question of
Porthos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Why," said he,
fixing his eyes upon Aramis, "on account of the two farmers of
the revenue, friends of M. Fouquet, whom the king forced to
disgorge their plunder, and then hanged them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> A scarcely perceptible
contraction of the prelate's brow showed that he had heard
D'Artagnan's reply.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Oh,
oh!" said Porthos; "and what were the names of these friends of
M. Fouquet?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

"Do you know these names, Aramis?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

disdainfully; "they sound like the names of financiers."</p>

were."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Aramis.</p>

Porthos; "but in the place of M. Fouquet - "</p>

him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Come, D'Artagnan,"

during this conversation, followed with his eye every gesture of
D'Artagnan, every glance of Porthos.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But D'Artagnan was impassible and
Porthos motionless; the thrusts aimed so skillfully were parried
by an able adversary; not one hit the mark.<span style=

fatigue of such a contest, and the announcement of supper was
well received by everybody.<span style=

conversation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Besides,
they felt that, upon their guard as each one had been, they could
neither of them boast of having the advantage.<span style=

what had been meant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He
had held himself motionless, because Aramis had made him a sign
not to stir.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Supper, for
him, was nothing but supper; but that was quite enough for
Porthos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The supper,
then, went off very well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan was in high spirits.<span style=

affability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos ate
like old Pelops.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Their
talk was of war, finance, the arts, and love.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Aramis played astonishment at every
word of politics D'Artagnan risked.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This long series of surprises
increased the mistrust of D'Artagnan, as the eternal indifference
of D'Artagnan provoked the suspicions of Aramis.<span style=

uttered the name of Colbert: he had reserved that stroke for the
last.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Aramis, who had watched through his curtains the last glimmer of
light in his friend's apartment, traversed the corridor on
tiptoe, and went to Porthos's room.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The giant who had been in bed nearly
an hour and a half, lay grandly stretched out on the down
bed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was in that happy
calm of the first sleep, which, with Porthos, resisted the noise
of bells or the report of cannon: his head swam in that soft
oscillation which reminds us of the soothing movement of a
ship.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In a moment Porthos
would have begun to dream.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The door of the chamber opened
softly under the delicate pressure of the hand of Aramis.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The bishop approached the
sleeper.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A thick carpet
deadened his steps, besides which Porthos snored in a manner to
drown all noise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He laid
one hand on his shoulder - "Rouse," said he, "wake up, my dear
Porthos."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The voice of
Aramis was soft and kind, but it conveyed more than a notice, -
it conveyed an order.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His
hand was light, but it indicated danger.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos heard the voice and felt the
hand of Aramis, even in the depth of sleep.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He started up.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Who goes there?" cried he, in his
giant's voice.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Hush! hush!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is I," said Aramis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You, my friend?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And what the devil do you wake
me for?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

must set off directly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Where for?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "For Paris."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Porthos bounded up in
his bed, and then sank back down again, fixing his great eyes in
agitation upon Aramis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "For Paris?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A hundred leagues?"
said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A hundred and four,"
replied the bishop.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mon Dieu!</i>" sighed Porthos, lying
down again, like children who contend with their <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>bonne</i> to gain an hour or two
more sleep.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Thirty hours' riding,"
said Aramis, firmly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "You
know there are good relays."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Porthos pushed out one
leg, allowing a groan to escape him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Come, come! my friend,"
insisted the prelate with a sort of impatience.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Porthos drew the other
leg out of the bed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "And
is it absolutely necessary that I should go, at once?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Urgently
necessary."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Porthos got upon his
feet, and began to shake both walls and floors with his steps of
a marble statue.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Hush! hush! for the
love of Heaven, my dear Porthos!" said Aramis, "you will wake
somebody."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! that's true,"
replied Porthos, in a voice of thunder, "I forgot that; but be
satisfied, I am on guard."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And so saying, he let fall a belt
loaded with his sword and pistols, and a purse, from which the
crowns escaped with a vibrating and prolonged noise.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This noise made the blood of Aramis
boil, whilst it drew from Porthos a formidable burst of
laughter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "How droll that
is!" said he, in the same voice.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Not so loud, Porthos,
not so loud."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "True, true!" and he
lowered his voice a half-note.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I was going to say,"
continued Porthos, "that it is droll that we are never so slow as
when we are in a hurry, and never make so much noise as when we
wish to be silent."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, that is true; but
let us give the proverb the lie, Porthos; let us make haste, and
hold our tongue."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You see I am doing my

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very well."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

haste?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is more than that,
it is serious, Porthos."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But don't be alarmed, I
had rubbed out your writing with India-rubber.<span style=

you had given me any advice in those works."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ay; but our friend has
phenomenally keen eyes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

of?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I fear that everything
is discovered, Porthos; the matter is, then, to prevent a great
misfortune.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have given
orders to my people to close all the gates and doors.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan will not be able to get
out before daybreak.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Your
horse is ready saddled; you will gain the first relay; by five

leagues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Come!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Aramis then assisted
Porthos to dress, piece by piece, with as much celerity as the
most skillful <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>valet de

"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos, half stupefied, let him do
as he liked, and confounded himself in excuses.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When he was ready, Aramis took him
by the hand, and led him, making him place his foot with
precaution on every step of the stairs, preventing him running
against door-frames, turning him this way and that, as if Aramis
had been the giant and Porthos the dwarf.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Soul set fire to and animated
matter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A horse was
waiting, ready saddled, in the courtyard.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos mounted.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then Aramis himself took the horse
by the bridle, and led him over some dung spread in the yard,
with the evident intention of suppressing noise.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He, at the same time, held tight the
horse's nose, to prevent him neighing.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When arrived at the outward gate,
drawing Porthos towards him, who was going off without even
asking him what for: "Now, friend Porthos, now; without drawing
bridle, till you get to Paris," whispered he in his ears; "eat on
horseback, drink on horseback, but lose not a minute."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That's enough; I will
not stop."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "This letter to M.

mid-day."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And do not forget <i

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What is that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That you are riding out
on a hunt for your <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>brevet</i> of <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>duc</i> and peer."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! oh!" said Porthos,
with his eyes sparkling; "I will do it in twenty-four hours, in
that case."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Try."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Then let go the bridle
- and forward, Goliath!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Aramis did let go, not
the bridle, but the horse's nose.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos released his hand, clapped
spurs to his horse, which set off at a gallop.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As long as he could distinguish
Porthos through the darkness, Aramis followed him with his eyes:
when he was completely out of sight, he re-entered the yard.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Nothing had stirred in
D'Artagnan's apartment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>valet</i> placed on
watch at the door had neither seen any light, nor heard any
noise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Aramis closed his
door carefully, sent the lackey to bed, and quickly sought his
own.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan really
suspected nothing, therefore thought he had gained everything,
when he awoke in the morning, about half-past four.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He ran to the window in his
shirt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The window looked
out upon the court.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Day
was dawning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The court
was deserted; the fowls, even, had not left their roosts.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Not a servant appeared.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Every door was closed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Good! all is still,"
said D'Artagnan to himself.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Never mind: I am up first in the
house.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Let us dress; that
will be so much done."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
And D'Artagnan dressed himself.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But, this time, he endeavored not to
give to the costume of M. Agnan that <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bourgeoise</i> and almost
ecclesiastical rigidity he had affected before; he managed, by
drawing his belt tighter, by buttoning his clothes in a different
fashion, and by putting on his hat a little on one side, to
restore to his person a little of that military character, the
absence of which had surprised Aramis.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This being done, he made free, or
affected to make free with his host, and entered his chamber
without ceremony.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Aramis
was asleep or feigned to be so.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A large book lay open upon his
night-desk, a wax-light was still burning in its silver
sconce.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This was more
than enough to prove to D'Artagnan the quiescence of the
prelate's night, and the good intentions of his waking.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The musketeer did to the
bishop precisely as the bishop had done to Porthos - he tapped
him on the shoulder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Evidently Aramis pretended to sleep; for, instead of waking
suddenly, he who slept so lightly required a repetition of the
summons.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! ah! is that you?"
said he, stretching his arms.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "What an agreeable surprise!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ma foi!</i><span style=

What o'clock is it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I do not know," said
D'Artagnan, a little embarrassed.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Early, I believe.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But, you know, that devil of a habit
of waking with the day, sticks to me still."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do you wish that we
should go out so soon?" asked Aramis.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "It appears to me to be very
early."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Just as you like."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I thought we had agreed

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

great a wish to see you, that I said to myself, the sooner the
better."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

sleep!" said Aramis: "Take care; I had reckoned upon them, and
what I lose of them I must make up."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But it seems to me
that, formerly, you were less of a sleeper than that, dear
friend; your blood was alive, and you were never to be found in
bed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And it is exactly on
account of what you tell me, that I am so fond of being there
now."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

it is not for the sake of sleeping, that you have put me off till
eight o'clock."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Aramis did not stir, his
brow remained unbent, he betrayed himself by no gesture or word;
"Go," said he, as D'Artagnan advanced to the door.<span style=

passed away when he came back.<span style=

superior of the Dominicans and the principal of the college of
the Jesuits, exactly in the same situation as he had found him
formerly in the auberge at Cr&egrave;vec&oelig;ur.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This company did not at all terrify
the musketeer.</p>

Aramis, quietly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "You
have apparently something to say to me, my friend."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is," replied
D'Artagnan, fixing his eyes upon Aramis, "it is that Porthos is
not in his apartment."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

calmly; "are you sure?"</p>

'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "<i style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

asking <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>you</i>."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And have you not
inquired?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, I have."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And what answer did you
get?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That Porthos, often
walking out in a morning, without saying anything, had probably
gone out."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What did you do,
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I went to the stables,"
replied D'Artagnan, carelessly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What to do?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To see if Porthos had
departed on horseback."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And?" interrogated the
bishop.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, there is a horse
missing, stall No. 3, Goliath."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> All this dialogue, it
may be easily understood, was not exempt from a certain
affectation on the part of the musketeer, and a perfect
complaisance on the part of Aramis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I guess how it is," said Aramis,
after having considered for a moment, "Porthos is gone out to
give us a surprise."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A surprise?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes; the canal which
goes from Vannes to the sea abounds in teal and snipes; that is
Porthos's favorite sport, and he will bring us back a dozen for
breakfast."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do you think so?" said
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am sure of it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Where else can he be?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I would lay a wager he took a
gun with him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, that is
possible," said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do one thing, my
friend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Get on horseback,
and join him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are right," said
D'Artagnan, "I will."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Shall I go with
you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, thank you; Porthos
is a rather remarkable man: I will inquire as I go along."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Will you take an
arquebus?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Thank<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Order what horse you
like to be saddled."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The one I rode
yesterday, on coming from Belle-Isle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "So be it: use the horse
as your own."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Aramis rang, and gave
orders to have the horse M. d'Artagnan had chosen saddled.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan followed the
servant charged with the execution of this order.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When arrived at the door, the
servant drew on one side to allow M. d'Artagnan to pass; and at
that moment he caught the eye of his master.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A knitting of the brow gave the
intelligent spy to understand that all should be given to
D'Artagnan he wished.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan got into the saddle, and Aramis heard the steps of his
horse on the pavement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> An
instant after, the servant returned.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well?" asked the
bishop.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monseigneur, he has
followed the course of the canal, and is going towards the sea,"
said the servant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very well!" said
Aramis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> In fact, D'Artagnan,
dismissing all suspicion, hastened towards the ocean, constantly
hoping to see in the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Landes</i>, or on the beach, the
colossal profile of Porthos.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He persisted in fancying he could
trace a horse's steps in every puddle.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Sometimes he imagined he heard the
report of a gun.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This
illusion lasted three hours; during two of which he went forward
in search of his friend - in the last he returned to the
house.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "We must have crossed,"
said he, "and I shall find them waiting for me at table."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan was
mistaken.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He no more
found Porthos at the palace than he had found him on the
sea-shore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Aramis was
waiting for him at the top of the stairs, looking very much
concerned.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Did my people not find
you, my dear D'Artagnan?" cried he, as soon as he caught sight of
the musketeer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No; did you send any
one after me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am deeply concerned,
my friend, deeply, to have induced you to make such a useless
search; but, about seven o'clock, the almoner of Saint-Patern
came here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had met Du
Vallon, who was going away, and who, being unwilling to disturb
anybody at the palace, had charged him to tell me that, fearing
M. G&eacute;tard would play him some ill turn in his absence, he
was going to take advantage of the morning tide to make a tour of
Belle-Isle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But tell me, Goliath
has not crossed the four leagues of sea, I should think."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "There are full six,"
said Aramis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That makes it less
probable still."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Therefore, my friend,"
said Aramis, with one of his blandest smiles, "Goliath is in the
stable, well pleased, I will answer for it, that Porthos is no
longer on his back."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In
fact, the horse had been brought back from the relay by the
direction of the prelate, from whom no detail escaped.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan appeared as well
satisfied with as possible with the explanation.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He entered upon a part of
dissimulation which agreed perfectly with the suspicions that
arose more strongly in his mind.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He breakfasted between the Jesuit
and Aramis, having the Dominican in front of him, and smiling
particularly at the Dominican, whose jolly, fat face pleased him
much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The repast was long
and sumptuous; excellent Spanish wine, fine Morbihan oysters,
exquisite fish from the mouth of the Loire, enormous prawns from
Paimb&oelig;uf, and delicious game from the moors, constituted
the principal part of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan ate much, and drank but little.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Aramis drank nothing, unless it was
water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> After the repast,
-</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You offered me an
arquebus," said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I did."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Lend it me, then."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Are you going
shooting?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Whilst waiting for
Porthos, it is the best thing I can do, I think."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Take which you like
from the trophy."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Will you not come with
me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I would with great
pleasure; but, alas! my friend, sporting is forbidden to
bishops."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!" said D'Artagnan,
"I did not know that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Besides," continued
Aramis, "I shall be busy till mid-day."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I shall go alone,
then?" said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am sorry to say you
must; but come back to dinner."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Pardieu!</i> the eating at your
house is too good to make me think of not coming back."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And thereupon D'Artagnan
quitted his host, bowed to the guests, and took his arquebus; but
instead of shooting, went straight to the little port of
Vannes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He looked in vain
to observe if anybody saw him; he could discern neither thing nor
person.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He engaged a
little fishing boat for twenty-five livres, and set off at
half-past eleven, convinced that he had not been followed; and
that was true, he had not been followed; only a Jesuit brother,
placed in the top of the steeple of his church, had not, since
the morning, by the help of an excellent glass, lost sight of one
of his steps.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At three
quarters past eleven, Aramis was informed that D'Artagnan was
sailing towards Belle-Isle.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The voyage was rapid; a good north
north-east wind drove him towards the isle.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As he approached, his eyes were
constantly fixed upon the coast.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He looked to see if, upon the shore
or upon the fortifications the brilliant dress and vast stature
of Porthos should stand out against a slightly clouded sky; but
his search was in vain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
He landed without having seen anything; and learnt from the first
soldier interrogated by him, that M. du Vallon had not yet
returned from Vannes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Then, without losing an instant, D'Artagnan ordered his little
bark to put its head towards Sarzeau.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We know that the wind changes with
the different hours of the day.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The breeze had veered from the north
north-east to the south-east; the wind, then, was almost as good
for the return to Sarzeau, as it had been for the voyage to
Belle-Isle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In three
hours D'Artagnan had touched the continent; two hours more
sufficed for his ride to Vannes.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In spite of the rapidity of his
passage, what D'Artagnan endured of impatience and anger during
that short passage, the deck alone of the vessel, upon which he
stamped backwards and forwards for three hours, could
testify.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He made but one
bound from the quay whereon he landed to the episcopal
palace.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He thought to
terrify Aramis by the promptitude of his return; he wished to
reproach him with his duplicity, and yet with reserve; but with
sufficient spirit, nevertheless, to make him feel all the
consequences of it, and force from him a part of his secret.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He hoped, in short - thanks to
that heat of expression which is to <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>secrets</i> what the charge with the
bayonet is to redoubts - to bring the mysterious Aramis to some
manifestation or other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
But he found, in the vestibule of the palace, the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>valet de chambre</i>, who closed his
passage, while smiling upon him with a stupid air.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monseigneur?" cried
D'Artagnan, endeavoring to put him aside with his hand.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Moved for an instant the valet
resumed his station.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monseigneur?" said
he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

not know me, <i style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

perhaps he tells monsieur le chevalier."</p>

fashion?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

he gave me for monsieur le chevalier."<span style=

form his pocket."</p>

rascal," said D'Artagnan, snatching it from his hand.<span style=

first line, "yes, I understand;" and he read: -</p>

interdicted his door, was working in the cabinet of his house at
Saint-Mand&eacute;, with which we are already acquainted, a
carriage, drawn by four horses steaming with sweat, entered the
court at full gallop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
This carriage was, probably, expected; for three or four lackeys
hastened to the door, which they opened.<span style=

Porthos does; D'Artagnan has not the gout and gravel, as I have;
he is not a horseman, he is a centaur.<span style=

landing-place, "What is that I hear up yonder?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> There was, in fact, a
hoarse, growling kind of noise, like the roar of a hungry tiger,

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Porthos was stretched upon the bed; his face was violet rather

the deep cavities of his chest made the glass of the windows
vibrate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To those
developed and clearly defined muscles starting from his face, to
his hair matted with sweat, to the energetic heaving of his chin
and shoulders, it was impossible to refuse a certain degree of
admiration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Strength
carried to this point is semi-divine.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The Herculean legs and feet of
Porthos had, by swelling, burst his stockings; all the strength
of his huge body was converted into the rigidity of stone.<span

does the giant of granite which reclines upon the plains of
Agrigentum.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> According to
P&eacute;lisson's orders, his boots had been cut off, for no
human power could have pulled them off.<span style=

pulling at them as they would have pulled capstans; and yet all
this did not awaken him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
They had hacked off his boots in fragments, and his legs had
fallen back upon the bed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
They then cut off the rest of his clothes, carried him to a bath,
in which they let him soak a considerable time.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They then put on him clean linen,
and placed him in a well-warmed bed - the whole with efforts and
pains which might have roused a dead man, but which did not make
Porthos open an eye, or interrupt for a second the formidable
diapason of his snoring.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Aramis wished on his part, with his nervous nature, armed with
extraordinary courage, to outbrave fatigue, and employ himself
with Gourville and P&eacute;lisson, but he fainted in the chair
in which he had persisted sitting.<span style=

The two sentences of death he had signed on mounting his throne
sometimes recurred to his memory; they were two black spots which
he saw with his eyes open; two spots of blood which he saw when
his eyes were closed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Monsieur," said he rather sharply, to the intendant; "it
sometimes seems to me that those two men you made me condemn were
not very great culprits."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

out from the herd of the farmers of the financiers, which wanted
decimating."</p>

whom?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

replied Colbert, coldly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

friends of the superintendent, were they not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, sire; friends who
would have given up their lives for Monsieur Fouquet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "They have given them,
monsieur," said the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is true; - but
uselessly, by good luck, - which was not their intention."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "How much money had
these men fraudulently obtained?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ten millions, perhaps;
of which six have been confiscated."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And is that money in my
coffers?" said the king with a certain air of repugnance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

this confiscation, whilst threatening M. Fouquet, has not touched
him."</p>

Colbert - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

raised against your majesty a troop of factious rioters to
extricate his friends from punishment, he will raise an army when

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king darted at his
confidant one of those looks which resemble the livid fire of a
flash of lightning, one of those looks which illuminate the
darkness of the basest consciences.<span style=

sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Fouquet, not satisfied with attracting all the money to himself,
as M. Mazarin did, and by that means depriving your majesty of
one part of your power, still wishes to attract to himself all
the friends of easy life and pleasure - of what idlers call
poetry, and politicians, corruption.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I think that, by holding the
subjects of your majesty in pay, he trespasses upon the royal

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

pays twenty thousand livres down when he need not pay more than
five thousand, will easily find that million when your majesty

the king, and presented a pen to him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> At that moment the usher
opened the door and announced monsieur le surintendant.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis turned pale.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Colbert let the pen fall, and drew
back from the king, over whom he extended his black wings like an
evil spirit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
superintendent made his entrance like a man of the court, to whom
a single glance was sufficient to make him appreciate the
situation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That situation
was not very encouraging for Fouquet, whatever might be his
consciousness of strength.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The small black eye of Colbert,
dilated by envy, and the limpid eye of Louis XIV. inflamed by
anger, signalled some pressing danger.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Courtiers are, with regard to court
rumors, like old soldiers, who distinguish through the blasts of
wind and bluster of leaves the sound of the distant steps of an
armed troop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They can,
after having listened, tell pretty nearly how many men are
marching, how many arms resound, how many cannons roll.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fouquet had then only to
interrogate the silence which his arrival had produced; he found
it big with menacing revelations.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king allowed him time enough to
advance as far as the middle of the chamber.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His adolescent modesty commanded
this forbearance of the moment.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fouquet boldly seized the
opportunity.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire," said he, "I was
impatient to see your majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What for?" asked
Louis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To announce some good
news to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Colbert, minus grandeur
of person, less largeness of heart, resembled Fouquet in many
points.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had the same
penetration, the same knowledge of men; moreover, that great
power of self-compression which gives to hypocrites time to
reflect, and gather themselves up to take a spring.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He guessed that Fouquet was going to
meet the blow he was about to deal him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His eyes glittered ominously.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What news?" asked the
king.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fouquet placed a
roll of papers on the table.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Let your majesty have
the goodness to cast your eyes over this work," said he.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king slowly unfolded the
paper.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Plans?" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And what are these
plans?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A new fortification,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah, ah!" said the king,
"you amuse yourself with tactics and strategies then, M.
Fouquet?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I occupy myself with
everything that may be useful to the reign of your majesty,"
replied Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Beautiful
descriptions!" said the king, looking at the design.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your majesty
comprehends, without doubt," said Fouquet, bending over the
paper; "here is the circle of the walls, here are the forts,
there the advanced works."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And what do I see here,
monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The sea."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The sea all round?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And what is, then, the
name of this place of which you show me the plan?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, it is
Belle-&Icirc;le-en-Mer," replied Fouquet with simplicity.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> At this word, at this
name, Colbert made so marked a movement, that the king turned
round to enforce the necessity for reserve.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fouquet did not appear to be the
least in the world concerned by the movement of Colbert, or the
king's signal.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur," continued
Louis, "you have then fortified Belle-Isle?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, sire; and I have
brought the plan and the accounts to your majesty," replied
Fouquet; "I have expended sixteen hundred livres in this
operation."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What to do?" replied
Louis, coldly, having taken the initiative from a malicious look
of the intendant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "For an aim very easy to
seize," replied Fouquet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Your majesty was on cool terms with Great Britain."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes; but since the
restoration of King Charles II. I have formed an alliance with
him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A month since, sire,
your majesty has truly said; but it is more than six months since
the fortifications of Belle-Isle were begun."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Then they have become
useless."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, fortifications
are never useless.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I
fortified Belle-Isle against MM. Monk and Lambert and all those
London citizens who were playing at soldiers.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Belle-Isle will be ready fortified
against the Dutch, against whom either England or your majesty
cannot fail to make war."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king was again
silent, and looked askant at Colbert.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Belle-Isle, I believe," added
Louis, "is yours, M. Fouquet?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Whose then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your majesty's."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Colbert was seized with
as much terror as if a gulf had opened beneath his feet.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis started with admiration,
either at the genius or the devotion of Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Explain yourself,
monsieur," said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Nothing more easy,
sire; Belle-Isle is one of my estates; I have fortified it at my
own expense.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But as
nothing in the world can oppose a subject making an humble
present to his king, I offer your majesty the proprietorship of
the estate, of which you will leave me the usufruct.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Belle-Isle, as a place of war, ought
to be occupied by the king.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Your majesty will be able,
henceforth, to keep a safe garrison there."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Colbert felt almost
sinking down upon the floor.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To keep himself from falling, he was
obliged to hold by the columns of the wainscoting.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "This is a piece of
great skill in the art of war that you have exhibited here,
monsieur," said Louis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, the initiative
did not come from me," replied Fouquet; "many officers have
inspired me with it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
plans themselves have been made by one of the most distinguished
engineers."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "His name?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "M. du Vallon."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "M. du Vallon?" resumed
Louis; "I do not know him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is much to be lamented, M.
Colbert," continued he, "that I do not know the names of the men
of talent who do honor to my reign."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And while saying these words he
turned towards Colbert.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The latter felt himself crushed, the sweat flowed from his brow,
no word presented itself to his lips, he suffered an
inexpressible martyrdom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"You will recollect that name," added Louis XIV.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Colbert bowed, but was
paler than his ruffles of Flemish lace.<span style=

Louis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! sire, that concerns
your majesty; it did not become me to place cannon in my own
house, unless your majesty had told me it was yours."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis began to float,
undetermined between the hatred which this so powerful man
inspired him with, and the pity he felt for the other, so cast
down, who seemed to him the counterfeit of the former.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But the consciousness of his
kingly duty prevailed over the feelings of the man, and he
stretched out his finger to the paper.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It must have cost you a
great deal of money to carry these plans into execution," said
he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

honor of telling your majesty the amount."</p>

please, I have forgotten it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

thousand livres! you are enormously rich, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is your majesty who
is rich, since Belle-Isle is yours."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, thank you; but
however rich I may be, M. Fouquet - "<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king stopped.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, sire?" asked the
superintendent.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I foresee the moment
when I shall want money."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You, sire?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And at what moment then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To-morrow, for
example."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Will your majesty do me
the honor to explain yourself?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

marry the English Princess."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, I ought to give
the bride a reception worthy of the granddaughter of Henry
IV."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is but just,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Then I shall want
money."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No doubt."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I shall want - " Louis
hesitated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The sum he was
going to demand was the same that he had been obliged to refuse
Charles II.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He turned
towards Colbert, that he might give the blow.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I shall want, to-morrow
- " repeated he, looking at Colbert.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A million," said the
latter, bluntly; delighted to take his revenge.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Fouquet turned his back
upon the intendant to listen to the king.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He did not turn round, but waited
till the king repeated, or rather murmured, "A million."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! sire," replied
Fouquet disdainfully, "a million! what will your majesty do with
a million?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It appears to me,
nevertheless - " said Louis XIV.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is not more than
is spent at the nuptials of one of the most petty princes of
Germany."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your majesty must have
two millions at least.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The horses alone would run away with five hundred thousand
livres.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I shall have the
honor of sending your majesty sixteen hundred thousand livres
this evening."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "How," said the king,
"sixteen hundred thousand livres?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Look, sire," replied
Fouquet, without even turning towards Colbert, "I know that wants
four hundred thousand livres of the two millions.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But this monsieur of l'intendance"
(pointing over his shoulder to Colbert, who if possible, became
paler, behind him) "has in his coffers nine hundred thousand
livres of mine."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king turned round to
look at Colbert.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But - " said the
latter.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur," continued
Fouquet, still speaking indirectly to Colbert, "monsieur has
received, a week ago, sixteen hundred thousand livres; he has
paid a hundred thousand livres to the guards, sixty-four thousand
livres to the hospitals, twenty-five thousand to the Swiss, an
hundred and thirty thousand for provisions, a thousand for arms,
ten thousand for accidental expenses; I do not err, then, in
reckoning upon nine hundred thousand livres that are left."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then turning towards Colbert,
like a disdainful head of office towards his inferior, "Take
care, monsieur," said he, "that those nine hundred thousand
livres be remitted to his majesty this evening, in gold."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But," said the king,
"that will make two millions five hundred thousand livres."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, the five hundred
thousand livres over will serve as pocket money for his royal
highness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You understand,
Monsieur Colbert, this evening before eight o'clock."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And with these words,
bowing respectfully to the king, the superintendent made his exit
backwards, without honoring with a single look the envious man,
whose head he had just half shaved.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Colbert tore his ruffles
to pieces in his rage, and bit his lips till they bled.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Fouquet had not passed
the door of the cabinet, when an usher pushing by him, exclaimed:
"A courier from Bretagne for his majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "M. d'Herblay was
right," murmured Fouquet, pulling out his watch; "an hour and
fifty-five minutes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It
was quite true."</p>
