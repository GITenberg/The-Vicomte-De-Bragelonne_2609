<p class="MsoNormal">We produce about two million dollars for
each hour we work.  The</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">time it takes us, a rather conservative
estimate, is fifty hours</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">to get any etext selected, entered,
proofread, edited, copyright</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">searched and analyzed, the copyright letters
written, etc.  This</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">projected audience is one hundred million
readers.  If our value</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">per text is nominally estimated at one
dollar then we produce $2</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">million dollars per hour this year as we
release thirty-six text</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999
for a total of 2000+</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If these reach just 10% of the computerized
population, then the</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">total should reach over 200 billion Etexts
given away this year.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give
Away One Trillion Etext</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x
100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This is ten thousand titles each to one
hundred million readers,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">which is only ~5% of the present number of
computer users.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">At our revised rates of production, we will
reach only one-third</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">of that goal by the end of 2001, or about
3,333 Etexts unless we</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">manage to get some real funding; currently
our funding is mostly</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">from Michael Hart's salary at
Carnegie-Mellon University, and an</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is
only good for a few</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">more years, so we are looking for something
to replace it, as we</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">that many people see those titles as meaning

<span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Introduction:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>In the months of
March-July in 1844, in the magazine <i>Le Si&egrave;cle</i>, the
first portion of a story appeared, penned by the celebrated
playwright Alexandre Dumas.  It was based, he claimed, on some
manuscripts he had found a year earlier in the Bibliotheque
Nationale while researching a history he planned to write on
Louis XIV.  They chronicled the adventures of a young man named
D'Artagnan who, upon entering Paris, became almost immediately
embroiled in court intrigues, international politics, and
ill-fated affairs between royal lovers.  Over the next six years,
readers would enjoy the adventures of this youth and his three
famous friends, Porthos, Athos, and Aramis, as their exploits
unraveled behind the scenes of some of the most momentous events
in French and even English history.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Eventually these serialized
adventures were published in novel form, and became the three
D'Artagnan Romances known today.  Here is a brief summary of the
first two novels:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><u>The Three Musketeers</u> (serialized
March - July, 1844): The year is 1625.  The young D'Artagnan
arrives in Paris at the tender age of 18, and almost immediately
offends three musketeers, Porthos, Aramis, and Athos.  Instead of
dueling, the four are attacked by five of the Cardinal's guards,
and the courage of the youth is made apparent during the battle. 
The four become fast friends, and, when asked by D'Artagnan's
landlord to find his missing wife, embark upon an adventure that
takes them across both France and England in order to thwart the
plans of the Cardinal Richelieu.  Along the way, they encounter a
beautiful young spy, named simply Milady, who will stop at
nothing to disgrace Queen Anne of Austria before her husband,
Louis XIII, and take her revenge upon the four friends.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Twenty Years After</u> (serialized
January - August, 1845): The year is now 1648, twenty years since
the close of the last story.  Louis XIII has died, as has
Cardinal Richelieu, and while the crown of France may sit upon
the head of Anne of Austria as Regent for the young Louis XIV,
the real power resides with the Cardinal Mazarin, her secret
husband.  D'Artagnan is now a lieutenant of musketeers, and his
three friends have retired to private life.  Athos turned out to
be a nobleman, the Comte de la F&egrave;re, and has retired to
his home with his son, Raoul de Bragelonne.  Aramis, whose real
name is D'Herblay, has followed his intention of shedding the
musketeer's cassock for the priest's robes, and Porthos has
married a wealthy woman, who left him her fortune upon her
death.  But trouble is stirring in both France and England. 
Cromwell menaces the institution of royalty itself while marching
against Charles I, and at home the Fronde is threatening to tear
France apart.  D'Artagnan brings his friends out of retirement to
save the threatened English monarch, but Mordaunt, the son of
Milady, who seeks to avenge his mother's death at the musketeers'
hands, thwarts their valiant efforts.  Undaunted, our heroes
return to France just in time to help save the young Louis XIV,
quiet the Fronde, and tweak the nose of Cardinal Mazarin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The third novel, <u>The
Vicomte de Bragelonne</u> (serialized October, 1847 - January,
1850), has enjoyed a strange history in its English translation. 
It has been split into three, four, or five volumes at various
points in its history.  The five-volume edition generally does
not give titles to the smaller portions, but the others do.  In
the three-volume edition, the novels are entitled <u>The Vicomte
de Bragelonne</u>, <u>Louise de la Valli&egrave;re</u>, and
<u>The Man in the Iron Mask</u>.  For the purposes of this etext,
I have chosen to split the novel as the four-volume edition does,
with these titles: <u>The Vicomte de Bragelonne</u>, <u>Ten Years
Later</u>, <u>Louise de la Valli&egrave;re</u>, and <u>The Man in
the Iron Mask</u>.  In this, the first of the four etexts, the
situation is thus:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It is now 1660, and although promised the
captaincy of the musketeers at the close of <u>Twenty Years
After</u>, D'Artagnan is still trailing his sword in the Louvre
as a lowly lieutenant.  Louis XIV is well past the age where he
should rule, but the ailing Cardinal Mazarin refuses to
relinquish the reins of power.  Meanwhile, Charles II, a king
without a country, travels Europe seeking aid from his fellow
monarchs.  Athos still resides at La F&egrave;re while his son,
Raoul de Bragelonne, has entered into the service in the
household of M. le Prince.  As for Raoul, he has his eyes on an
entirely different object than his father &ndash; his childhood
companion, Louise de la Valli&egrave;re, with whom he is
hopelessly in love.  Porthos, now a baron, is off on some
mysterious mission along with Aramis, who is now the Bishop of
Vannes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Now begins the first chapter of the last of
the D'Artagnan Romances, <u>The Vicomte de Bragelonne</u>.

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>T</span>owards the
middle of the month of May, in the year 1660, at nine o'clock in
the morning, when the sun, already high in the heavens, was fast
absorbing the dew from the ramparts of the castle of Blois, a
little cavalcade, composed of three men and two pages, re-entered
the city by the bridge, without producing any other effect upon
the passengers of the quay beyond a first movement of the hand to
the head, as a salute, and a second movement of the tongue to
express, in the purest French then spoken in France: "There is
Monsieur returning from hunting."  And that was all.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Whilst, however, the horses
were climbing the steep acclivity which leads from the river to
the castle, several shop-boys approached the last horse, from
whose saddle-bow a number of birds were suspended by the
beak.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                On seeing this, the
inquisitive youths manifested with rustic freedom their contempt
for such paltry sport, and, after a dissertation among themselves
upon the disadvantages of hawking, they returned to their
occupations; one only of the curious party, a stout, stubby,
cheerful lad, having demanded how it was that Monsieur, who, from
his great revenues, had it in his power to amuse himself so much
better, could be satisfied with such mean diversions.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do you not know," one of
the standers-by replied, "that Monsieur's principal amusement is
to weary himself?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The light-hearted boy
shrugged his shoulders with a gesture which said as clear as day:
"In that case I would rather be plain Jack than a prince."  And
all resumed their labors.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                In the meanwhile, Monsieur
continued his route with an air at once so melancholy and so
majestic, that he certainly would have attracted the attention of
spectators, if spectators there had been; but the good citizens
of Blois could not pardon Monsieur for having chosen their gay
city for an abode in which to indulge melancholy at his ease, and
as often as they caught a glimpse of the illustrious
<i>ennuy&eacute;</i>, they stole away gaping, or drew back their
heads into the interior of their dwellings, to escape the
soporific influence of that long pale face, of those watery eyes,
and that languid address; so that the worthy prince was almost
certain to find the streets deserted whenever he chanced to pass
through them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Now, on the part of the
citizens of Blois this was a culpable piece of disrespect, for
Monsieur was, after the king - nay, even perhaps, before the king
- the greatest noble of the kingdom.  In fact, God, who had
granted to Louis XIV., then reigning, the honor of being son of
Louis XIII., had granted to Monsieur the honor of being son of
Henry IV.  It was not then, or, at least, it ought not to have
been, a trifling source of pride for the city of Blois, that
Gaston of Orl&eacute;ans had chosen it as his residence, and held
his court in the ancient Castle of the States.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                But it was the destiny of
this great prince to excite the attention and admiration of the
public in a very modified degree wherever he might be.  Monsieur
had fallen into this situation by habit.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                It was not, perhaps, this
which gave him that air of listlessness.  Monsieur had already
been tolerably busy in the course of his life.  A man cannot
allow the heads of a dozen of his best friends to be cut off
without feeling a little excitement; and as, since the accession
of Mazarin to power, no heads had been cut off, Monsieur's
occupation was gone, and his <i>morale</i> suffered from it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The life of the poor prince
was then very dull.  After his little morning hawking-party on
the banks of the Beuvron, or in the woods of Cheverny, Monsieur
crossed the Loire, went to breakfast at Chambord, with or without
an appetite, and the city of Blois heard no more of its sovereign
lord and master till the next hawking-day.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                So much for the ennui
<i>extra muros</i>; of the ennui of the interior we will give the
reader an idea if he will with us follow the cavalcade to the
majestic porch of the Castle of the States.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monsieur rode a little
steady-paced horse, equipped with a large saddle of red Flemish
velvet, with stirrups in the shape of buskins; the horse was of a
bay color; Monsieur's pourpoint of crimson velvet corresponded
with the cloak of the same shade and the horse's equipment, and
it was only by this red appearance of the whole that the prince
could be known from his two companions, the one dressed in
violet, the other in green.  He on the left, in violet, was his
equerry; he on the right, in green, was the <i>grand
veneur</i>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                One of the pages carried two
gerfalcons upon a perch, the other a hunting-horn, which he blew
with a careless note at twenty paces from the castle.  Every one
about this listless prince did what he had to listlessly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                At this signal, eight
guards, who were lounging in the sun in the square court, ran to
their halberts, and Monsieur made his solemn entry into the
castle.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                When he had disappeared
under the shades of the porch, three or four idlers, who had
followed the cavalcade to the castle, after pointing out the
suspended birds to each other, dispersed with comments upon what
they saw: and, when they were gone, the street, the palace, and
the court, all remained deserted alike.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monsieur dismounted without
speaking a word, went straight to his apartments, where his valet
changed his dress, and as Madame had not yet sent orders
respecting breakfast, Monsieur stretched himself upon a <i>chaise
longue</i>, and was soon as fast asleep as if it had been eleven
o'clock at night.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The eight guards, who
concluded their service for the day was over, laid themselves
down very comfortably in the sun upon some stone benches; the
grooms disappeared with their horses into the stables, and, with
the exception of a few joyous birds, startling each other with
their sharp chirping in the tufted shrubberies, it might have
been thought that the whole castle was as soundly asleep as
Monsieur was.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                All at once, in the midst of
this delicious silence, there resounded a clear ringing laugh,
which caused several of the halberdiers in the enjoyment of their
<i>siesta</i> to open at least one eye.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This burst of laughter
proceeded from a window of the castle, visited at this moment by
the sun, that embraced it in one of those large angles which the
profiles of the chimneys mark out upon the walls before
mid-day.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The little balcony of
wrought iron which advanced in front of this window was furnished
with a pot of red gilliflowers, another pot of primroses, and an
early rose-tree, the foliage of which, beautifully green, was
variegated with numerous red specks announcing future roses.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                In the chamber lighted by
this window, was a square table, covered with an old
large-flowered Haarlem tapestry; in the center of this table was
a long-necked stone bottle, in which were irises and lilies of
the valley; at each end of this table was a young girl.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The position of these two
young people was singular; they might have been taken for two
boarders escaped from a convent.  One of them, with both elbows
on the table, and a pen in her hand, was tracing characters upon
a sheet of fine Dutch paper; the other, kneeling upon a chair,
which allowed her to advance her head and bust over the back of
it to the middle of the table, was watching her companion as she
wrote, or rather hesitated to write.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Thence the thousand cries,
the thousand railleries, the thousand laughs, one of which, more
brilliant than the rest, had startled the birds in the gardens,
and disturbed the slumbers of Monsieur's guards.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                We are taking portraits now;
we shall be allowed, therefore, we hope, to sketch the two last
of this chapter.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The one who was leaning in
the chair - that is to say, the joyous, laughing one - was a
beautiful girl of from eighteen to twenty, with brown complexion
and brown hair, splendid, from eyes which sparkled beneath
strongly-marked brows, and particularly from her teeth, which
seemed to shine like pearls between her red coral lips.  Her
every movement seemed the accent of a sunny nature; she did not
walk - she bounded.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The other, she who was
writing, looked at her turbulent companion with an eye as limpid,
as pure, and as blue as the azure of the day.  Her hair, of a
shaded fairness, arranged with exquisite taste, fell in silky
curls over her lovely mantling cheeks; she passed across the
paper a delicate hand, whose thinness announced her extreme
youth.  At each burst of laughter that proceeded from her friend,
she raised, as if annoyed, her white shoulders in a poetical and
mild manner, but they were wanting in that richfulness of mold
that was likewise to be wished in her arms and hands.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Montalais!  Montalais!"
said she at length, in a voice soft and caressing as a melody,
"you laugh too loud - you laugh like a man!  You will not only
draw the attention of messieurs the guards, but you will not hear
Madame's bell when Madame rings."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This admonition neither made
the young girl called Montalais cease to laugh nor gesticulate.
She only replied: "Louise, you do not speak as you think, my
dear; you know that messieurs the guards, as you call them, have
only just commenced their sleep, and that a cannon would not
waken them; you know that Madame's bell can be heard at the
bridge of Blois, and that consequently I shall hear it when my
services are required by Madame.  What annoys you, my child, is
that I laugh while you are writing; and what you are afraid of is
that Madame de Saint-R&eacute;my, your mother, should come up
here, as she does sometimes when we laugh too loud, that she
should surprise us, and that she should see that enormous sheet
of paper upon which, in a quarter of an hour, you have only
traced the words <i>Monsieur Raoul</i>.  Now, you are right, my
dear Louise, because after these words, 'Monsieur Raoul', others
may be put so significant and incendiary as to cause Madame
Saint-R&eacute;my to burst out into fire and flames! <i>Hein!</i>
is not that true now? - say."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                And Montalais redoubled her
laughter and noisy provocations.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The fair girl at length
became quite angry; she tore the sheet of paper on which, in
fact, the words "Monsieur Raoul" were written in good characters;
and crushing the paper in her trembling hands, she threw it out
of the window.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "There! there!" said
Mademoiselle de Montalais; "there is our little lamb, our gentle
dove, angry! Don't be afraid, Louise - Madame de
Saint-R&eacute;my will not come; and if she should, you know I
have a quick ear.  Besides, what can be more permissible than to
write to an old friend of twelve years' standing, particularly
when the letter begins with the words 'Monsieur Raoul'?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is all very well - I
will not write to him at all," said the young girl.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, ah! in good sooth,
Montalais is properly punished," cried the jeering brunette,
still laughing.  "Come, come! let us try another sheet of paper,
and finish our dispatch off-hand.  Good! there is the bell
ringing now.  By my faith, so much the worse!  Madame must wait,
or else do without her first maid of honor this morning."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                A bell, in fact, did ring;
it announced that Madame had finished her toilette, and waited
for Monsieur to give her his hand, and conduct her from the
<i>salon</i> to the refectory.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This formality being
accomplished with great ceremony, the husband and wife
breakfasted, and then separated till the hour of dinner,
invariably fixed at two o'clock.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The sound of this bell
caused a door to be opened in the offices on the left hand of the
court, from which filed two <i>ma&icirc;tres d'h&ocirc;tel</i>
followed by eight scullions bearing a kind of hand-barrow loaded
with dishes under silver covers.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                One of the <i>ma&icirc;tres
d'h&ocirc;tel</i>, the first in rank, touched one of the guards,
who was snoring on his bench, slightly with his wand; he even
carried his kindness so far as to place the halbert which stood
against the wall in the hands of the man stupid with sleep, after
which the soldier, without explanation, escorted the
<i>viande</i> of Monsieur to the refectory, preceded by a page
and the two <i>ma&icirc;tres d'h&ocirc;tel</i>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Wherever the <i>viande</i>
passed, the soldiers ported arms.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Mademoiselle de Montalais
and her companion had watched from their window the details of
this ceremony, to which, by the bye, they must have been pretty
well accustomed.  But they did not look so much from curiosity as
to be assured they should not be disturbed.  So, guards,
scullions, <i>ma&icirc;tres d'h&ocirc;tel</i>, and pages having
passed, they resumed their places at the table; and the sun,
which, through the window-frame, had for an instant fallen upon
those two charming countenances, now only shed its light upon the
gilliflowers, primroses, and rose-tree.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bah!" said Mademoiselle de
Montalais, taking her place again; "Madame will breakfast very
well without me!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!  Montalais, you will be
punished!" replied the other girl, sitting down quietly in
hers.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Punished, indeed! - that is
to say, deprived of a ride!  That is just the way in which I wish
to be punished.  To go out in the grand coach, perched upon a
doorstep; to turn to the left, twist round to the right, over
roads full of ruts, where we cannot exceed a league in two hours;
and then to come back straight towards the wing of the castle in
which is the window of Mary de Medici, so that Madame never fails
to say: 'Could one believe it possible that Mary de Medici should
have escaped from that window - forty-seven feet high?  The
mother of two princes and three princesses!'  If you call that
relaxation, Louise, all I ask is to be punished every day;
particularly when my punishment is to remain with you and write
such interesting letters as we write!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Montalais!  Montalais!
there are duties to be performed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You talk of them very much
at your ease, dear child! - you, who are left quite free amidst
this tedious court.  You are the only person that reaps the
advantages of them without incurring the trouble, - you, who are
really more one of Madame's maids of honor than I am, because
Madame makes her affection for your father-in-law glance off upon
you; so that you enter this dull house as the birds fly into
yonder court, inhaling the air, pecking the flowers, picking up
the grain, without having the least service to perform, or the
least annoyance to undergo.  And you talk to me of duties to be
performed!  In sooth, my pretty idler, what are your own proper
duties, unless to write to the handsome Raoul?  And even that you
don't do; so that it looks to me as if you likewise were rather
negligent of your duties!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louise assumed a serious
air, leant her chin upon her hand, and, in a tone full of candid
remonstrance, "And do you reproach me with my good fortune?" said
she.  "Can you have the heart to do it?  You have a future; you
will belong to the court; the king, if he should marry, will
require Monsieur to be near his person; you will see splendid
<i>f&ecirc;tes</i>, you will see the king, who they say is so
handsome, so agreeable!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ay, and still more, I shall
see Raoul, who attends upon M. le Prince," added Montalais,
maliciously.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Poor Raoul!" sighed
Louise.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Now is the time to write to
him, my pretty dear!  Come, begin again, with that famous
'Monsieur Raoul' which figures at the top of the poor torn
sheet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                She then held the pen toward
her, and with a charming smile encouraged her hand, which quickly
traced the words she named.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What next?" asked the
younger of the two girls.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, now write what you
think, Louise," replied Montalais.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Are you quite sure I think
of anything?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You think of somebody, and
that amounts to the same thing, or rather even more."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do you think so,
Montalais?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Louise, Louise, your blue
eyes are as deep as the sea I saw at Boulogne last year!  No, no,
I mistake - the sea is perfidious: your eyes are as deep as the
azure yonder - look! - over our heads!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, since you can read so
well in my eyes, tell me what I am thinking about,
Montalais."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In the first place, you
don't think, <i>Monsieur Raoul</i>; you think, <i>My dear
Raoul</i>."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Never blush for such a
trifle as that!  'My dear Raoul,' we will say - 'You implore me
to write you at Paris, where you are detained by your attendance
on M. le Prince. As you must be very dull there, to seek for
amusement in the remembrance of a <i>provinciale</i> - '"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louise rose up suddenly. 
"No, Montalais," said she, with a smile; "I don't think a word of
that.  Look, this is what I think;" and she seized the pen
boldly, and traced, with a firm hand, the following words:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I should have been very
unhappy if your entreaties to obtain a remembrance of me had been
less warm.  Everything here reminds me of our early days, which
so quickly passed away, which so delightfully flew by, that no
others will ever replace the charm of them in my heart."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Montalais, who watched the
flying pen, and read, the wrong way upwards, as fast as her
friend wrote, here interrupted by clapping her hands.  "Capital!"
cried she; "there is frankness - there is heart - there is
style!  Show these Parisians, my dear, that Blois is the city for
fine language!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He knows very well that
Blois was a Paradise to me," replied the girl.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is exactly what you
mean to say; and you speak like an angel."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I will finish, Montalais,"
and she continued as follows: "You often think of me, you say,
Monsieur Raoul: I thank you; but that does not surprise me, when
I recollect how often our hearts have beaten close to each
other."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! oh!" said Montalais. 
"Beware, my lamb!  You are scattering your wool, and there are
wolves about."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louise was about to reply,
when the gallop of a horse resounded under the porch of the
castle.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What is that?" said
Montalais, approaching the window.  "A handsome cavalier, by my
faith!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! - Raoul!" exclaimed
Louise, who had made the same movement as her friend, and,
becoming pale as death, sunk back beside her unfinished
letter.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Now, he is a clever lover,
upon my word!" cried Montalais; "he arrives just at the proper
moment."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Come in, come in, I implore
you!" murmured Louise.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bah! he does not know me. 
Let me see what he has come here for."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Chapter II:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style='text-align:center'>The
Messenger.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>M</span>ademoiselle
de Montalais was right; the young cavalier was goodly to look
upon.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                He was a young man of from
twenty-four to twenty-five years of age, tall and slender,
wearing gracefully the picturesque military costume of the
period.  His large boots contained a foot which Mademoiselle de
Montalais might not have disowned if she had been transformed
into a man.  With one of his delicate but nervous hands he
checked his horse in the middle of the court, and with the other
raised his hat, whose long plumes shaded his at once serious and
ingenuous countenance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The guards, roused by the
steps of the horse, awoke, and were on foot in a minute.  The
young man waited till one of them was close to his saddle-bow:
then, stooping towards him, in a clear, distinct voice, which was
perfectly audible at the window where the two girls were
concealed, "A message for his royal highness," he said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, ah!" cried the
soldier.  "Officer, a messenger!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                But this brave guard knew
very well that no officer would appear, seeing that the only one
who could have appeared dwelt at the other side of the castle, in
an apartment looking into the gardens.  So he hastened to add:
"The officer, monsieur, is on his rounds; but, in his absence, M.
de Saint-R&eacute;my, the <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>,
shall be informed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "M. de Saint-R&eacute;my?"
repeated the cavalier, slightly blushing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do you know him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, yes; but request him,
if you please, that my visit be announced to his royal highness
as soon as possible."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It appears to be pressing,"
said the guard, as if speaking to himself, but really in the hope
of obtaining an answer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The messenger made an
affirmative sign with his head.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In that case," said the
guard, "I will go and seek the <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>
myself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The young man, in the
meantime, dismounted; and whilst the others were making their
remarks upon the fine horse the cavalier rode, the soldier
returned.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your pardon, young
gentleman; but your name, if you please?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The Vicomte de Bragelonne,
on the part of his highness M. le Prince de Cond&eacute;."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The soldier made a profound
bow, and, as if the name of the conqueror of Rocroi and Lens had
given him wings, he stepped lightly up the steps leading to the
ante-chamber.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                M. de Bragelonne had not had
time to fasten his horse to the iron bars of the <i>perron</i>,
when M. de Saint-R&eacute;my came running, out of breath,
supporting his capacious body with one hand, whilst with the
other he cut the air as a fisherman cleaves the waves with his
oar.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, Monsieur le Vicomte! 
You at Blois!" cried he.  "Well, that is a wonder.  Good-day to
you - good-day, Monsieur Raoul."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I offer you a thousand
respects, M. de Saint-R&eacute;my."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How Madame de la Vall - I
mean, how delighted Madame de Saint-R&eacute;my will be to see
you!  But come in.  His royal highness is at breakfast - must he
be interrupted?  Is the matter serious?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, and no, Monsieur de
Saint-R&eacute;my.  A moment's delay, however, would be
disagreeable to his royal highness."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "If that is the case, we
will force the <i>consigne</i>, Monsieur le Vicomte.  Come in. 
Besides, Monsieur is in an excellent humor to-day.  And then you
bring news, do you not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Great news, Monsieur de
Saint-R&eacute;my.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And good, I presume?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Excellent."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Come quickly, come quickly
then!" cried the worthy man, putting his dress to rights as he
went along.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Raoul followed him, hat in
hand, and a little disconcerted at the noise made by his spurs in
these immense <i>salons</i>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                As soon as he had
disappeared in the interior of the palace, the window of the
court was repeopled, and an animated whispering betrayed the
emotion of the two girls.  They soon appeared to have formed a
resolution, for one of the two faces disappeared from the
window.  This was the brunette; the other remained behind the
balcony, concealed by the flowers, watching attentively through
the branches the <i>perron</i> by which M. de Bragelonne had
entered the castle.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                In the meantime the object
of so much laudable curiosity continued his route, following the
steps of the <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>.  The noise of
quick steps, an odor of wine and viands, a clinking of crystal
and plates, warned them that they were coming to the end of their
course.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The pages, valets and
officers, assembled in the office which led up to the refectory,
welcomed the newcomer with the proverbial politeness of the
country; some of them were acquainted with Raoul, and all knew
that he came from Paris.  It might be said that his arrival for a
moment suspended the service.  In fact, a page, who was pouring
out wine for his royal highness, on hearing the jingling of spurs
in the next chamber, turned round like a child, without
perceiving that he was continuing to pour out, not into the
glass, but upon the tablecloth.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Madame, who was not so
preoccupied as her glorious spouse was, remarked this distraction
of the page.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well?" exclaimed she.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well!" repeated Monsieur;
"what is going on then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                M. de Saint-R&eacute;my, who
had just introduced his head through the doorway, took advantage
of the moment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why am I to be disturbed?"
said Gaston, helping himself to a thick slice of one of the
largest salmon that had ever ascended the Loire to be captured
between Paimb&oelig;uf and Saint-Nazaire.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "There is a messenger from
Paris.  Oh! but after monseigneur has breakfasted will do; there
is plenty of time."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "From Paris!" cried the
prince, letting his fork fall.  "A messenger from Paris, do you
say?  And on whose part does this messenger come?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "On the part of M. le
Prince," said the <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> promptly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Every one knows that the
Prince de Cond&eacute; was so called.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A messenger from M. le
Prince!" said Gaston, with an inquietude that escaped none of the
assistants, and consequently redoubled the general curiosity.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monsieur, perhaps, fancied
himself brought back again to the happy times when the opening of
a door gave him an emotion, in which every letter might contain a
state secret, - in which every message was connected with a dark
and complicated intrigue.  Perhaps, likewise, that great name of
M. le Prince expanded itself, beneath the roofs of Blois, to the
proportions of a phantom.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monsieur pushed away his
plate.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Shall I tell the envoy to
wait?" asked M. de Saint-R&eacute;my.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                A glance from Madame
emboldened Gaston, who replied: "No, no! let him come in at once,
on the contrary.  <i>A propos</i>, who is he?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A gentleman of this
country, M. le Vicomte de Bragelonne."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, very well!  Introduce
him, Saint-R&eacute;my - introduce him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                And when he had let fall
these words, with his accustomed gravity, Monsieur turned his
eyes, in a certain manner, upon the people of his suite, so that
all, pages, officers, and equerries, quitted the service, knives
and goblets, and made towards the second chamber door a retreat
as rapid as it was disorderly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This little army had
dispersed in two files when Raoul de Bragelonne, preceded by M.
de Saint-R&eacute;my, entered the refectory.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The short interval of
solitude which this retreat had left him, permitted Monsieur the
time to assume a diplomatic countenance.  He did not turn round,
but waited till the <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> should
bring the messenger face to face with him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Raoul stopped even with the
lower end of the table, so as to be exactly between Monsieur and
Madame.  From this place he made a profound bow to Monsieur, and
a very humble one to Madame; then, drawing himself up into
military <i>pose</i>, he waited for Monsieur to address him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                On his part the prince
waited till the doors were hermetically closed; he would not turn
round to ascertain the fact, as that would have been derogatory
to his dignity, but he listened with all his ears for the noise
of the lock, which would promise him at least an appearance of
secrecy.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The doors being closed,
Monsieur raised his eyes towards the vicomte, and said, "It
appears that you come from Paris, monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This minute,
monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How is the king?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "His majesty is in perfect
health, monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And my sister-in-law?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Her majesty the
queen-mother still suffers from the complaint in her chest, but
for the last month she has been rather better."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Somebody told me you came
on the part of M. le Prince.  They must have been mistaken,
surely?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, monseigneur; M. le
Prince has charged me to convey this letter to your royal
highness, and I am to wait for an answer to it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Raoul had been a little
annoyed by this cold and cautious reception, and his voice
insensibly sank to a low key.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The prince forgot that he
was the cause of this apparent mystery, and his fears
returned.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                He received the letter from
the Prince de Cond&eacute; with a haggard look, unsealed it as he
would have unsealed a suspicious packet, and in order to read it
so that no one should remark the effects of it upon his
countenance, he turned round.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Madame followed, with an
anxiety almost equal to that of the prince, every maneuver of her
august husband.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Raoul, impassible, and a
little disengaged by the attention of his hosts, looked from his
place through the open window at the gardens and the statues
which peopled them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well!" cried Monsieur, all
at once, with a cheerful smile; "here is an agreeable surprise,
and a charming letter from M. le Prince.  Look, Madame!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The table was too large to
allow the arm of the prince to reach the hand of Madame; Raoul
sprang forward to be their intermediary, and did it with so good
a grace as to procure a flattering acknowledgement from the
princess.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You know the contents of
this letter, no doubt?" said Gaston to Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monseigneur; M. le
Prince at first gave me the message verbally, but upon reflection
his highness took up his pen."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is beautiful writing,"
said Madame, "but I cannot read it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Will you read it to Madame,
M. de Bragelonne?" said the duke.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes; read it, if you
please, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Raoul began to read,
Monsieur giving again all his attention.  The letter was
conceived in these terms:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "MONSEIGNEUR - The king is
about to set out for the frontiers.  You are aware the marriage
of his majesty is concluded upon.  The king has done me the honor
to appoint me his <i>mar&eacute;chal-des-logis</i> for this
journey, and as I knew with what joy his majesty would pass a day
at Blois, I venture to ask your royal highness's permission to
mark the house you inhabit as our quarters.  If, however, the
suddenness of this request should create to your royal highness
any embarrassment, I entreat you to say so by the messenger I
send, a gentleman of my suite, M. le Vicomte de Bragelonne.  My
itinerary will depend on your royal highness's determination, and
instead of passing through Blois, we shall come through
Vend&ocirc;me or Romorantin.  I venture to hope that your royal
highness will be pleased with my arrangement, it being the
expression of my boundless desire to make myself agreeable to
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Nothing can be more
gracious toward us," said Madame, who had more than once
consulted the looks of her husband during the reading of the
letter.  "The king here!" exclaimed she, in a rather louder tone
than would have been necessary to preserve secrecy.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," said his royal
highness in his turn, "you will offer my thanks to M. de
Cond&eacute;, and express to him my gratitude for the honor he
has done me."  Raoul bowed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "On what day will his
majesty arrive?" continued the prince.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The king, monseigneur, will
in all probability arrive this evening."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But how, then, could he
have known my reply if it had been in the negative?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I was desired, monseigneur,
to return in all haste to Beaugency, to give counter-orders to
the courier, who was himself to go back immediately with
counter-orders to M. le Prince."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "His majesty is at
Orl&eacute;ans, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Much nearer, monseigneur;
his majesty must by this time have arrived at Meung."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Does the court accompany
him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>A propos</i>, I forgot
to ask you after M. le Cardinal."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "His eminence appears to
enjoy good health, monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "His nieces accompany him,
no doubt?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, monseigneur; his
eminence has ordered the Mesdemoiselles de Mancini to set out for
Brouage.  They will follow the left bank of the Loire, while the
court will come by the right.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What!  Mademoiselle Mary de
Mancini quit the court in that manner?" asked Monsieur, his
reserve beginning to diminish.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Mademoiselle Mary de
Mancini in particular," replied Raoul discreetly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                A fugitive smile, an
imperceptible vestige of his ancient spirit of intrigue, shot
across the pale face of the prince.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thanks, M. de Bragelonne,"
then said Monsieur.  "You would, perhaps, not be willing to carry
M. le Prince the commission with which I would charge you, and
that is, that his messenger has been very agreeable to me; but I
will tell him so myself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Raoul bowed his thanks to
Monsieur for the honor he had done him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monsieur made a sign to
Madame, who struck a bell which was placed at her right hand; M.
de Saint-R&eacute;my entered, and the room was soon filled with
people.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Messieurs," said the
prince, "his majesty is about to pay me the honor of passing a
day at Blois; I depend on the king, my nephew, not having to
repent of the favor he does my house."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Vive le Roi!</i>" cried
all the officers of the household with frantic enthusiasm, and M.
de Saint-R&eacute;my louder than the rest.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Gaston hung down his head
with evident chagrin.  He had all his life been obliged to hear,
or rather to undergo, this cry of "<i>Vive le Roi!</i>" which
passed over him.  For a long time, being unaccustomed to hear it,
his ear had had rest, and now a younger, more vivacious, and more
brilliant royalty rose up before him, like a new and more painful
provocation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Madame perfectly understood
the sufferings of that timid, gloomy heart; she rose from the
table, Monsieur imitated her mechanically, and all the domestics,
with a buzzing like that of several bee-hives, surrounded Raoul
for the purpose of questioning him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Madame saw this movement,
and called M. de Saint-R&eacute;my.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This is not the time for
gossiping, but working," said she, with the tone of an angry
housekeeper.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                M. de Saint-R&eacute;my
hastened to break the circle formed by the officers round Raoul,
so that the latter was able to gain the ante-chamber.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Care will be taken of that
gentleman, I hope," added Madame, addressing M. de
Saint-R&eacute;my.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The worthy man immediately
hastened after Raoul.  "Madame desires refreshments to be offered
to you," said he; "and there is, besides, a lodging for you in
the castle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thanks, M. de
Saint-R&eacute;my," replied Raoul; "but you know how anxious I
must be to pay my duty to M. le Comte, my father."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is true, that is true,
Monsieur Raoul; present him, at the same time, my humble
respects, if you please."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Raoul thus once more got rid
of the old gentleman, and pursued his way.  As he was passing
under the porch, leading his horse by the bridle, a soft voice
called him from the depths of an obscure path.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur Raoul!" said the
voice.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The young man turned round,
surprised, and saw a dark complexioned girl, who, with a finger
on her lip, held out her other hand to him.  This young lady was
an utter stranger.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>R</span>aoul made one
step towards the girl who thus called him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But my horse, madame?" said
he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! you are terribly
embarrassed!  Go yonder way - there is a shed in the outer court:
fasten your horse, and return quickly!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I obey, madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Raoul was not four minutes
in performing what he had been directed to do; he returned to the
little door, where, in the gloom, he found his mysterious
conductress waiting for  him, on the first steps of a winding
staircase.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Are you brave enough to
follow me, monsieur knight errant?" asked the girl, laughing at
the momentary hesitation Raoul had manifested.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The latter replied by
springing up the dark staircase after her.  They thus climbed up
three stories, he behind her, touching with his hands, when he
felt for the banister, a silk dress which rubbed against each
side of the staircase.  At every false step made by Raoul, his
conductress cried, "Hush!" and held out to him a soft perfumed
hand.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "One would mount thus to the
belfry of the castle without being conscious of fatigue," said
Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "All of which means,
monsieur, that you are very much perplexed, very tired, and very
uneasy.  But be of good cheer, monsieur; here we are, at our
destination."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The girl threw open a door,
which immediately, without any transition, filled with a flood of
light the landing of the staircase, at the top of which Raoul
appeared, holding fast by the balustrade.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The girl continued to walk
on - he followed her; she entered a chamber - he did the
same.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                As soon as he was fairly in
the net he heard a loud cry, and, turning round, saw at two paces
from him, with her hands clasped and her eyes closed, that
beautiful fair girl with blue eyes and white shoulders, who,
recognizing him, called him Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                He saw her, and divined at
once so much love and so much joy in the expression of her
countenance, the he sank on his knees in the middle of the
chamber, murmuring, on his part, the name of Louise.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah!  Montalais! -
Montalais!" she sighed, "it is very wicked to deceive me so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who, I?  I have deceived
you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes; you told me you would
go down to inquire the news, and you have brought up
monsieur!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, I was obliged to do
so - how else could he have received the letter you wrote him?" 
And she pointed with her finger to the letter which was still
upon the table.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Raoul made a step to take
it; Louise, more rapid, although she had sprung forward with a
sufficiently remarkable physical hesitation, reached out her hand
to stop him.  Raoul came in contact with that trembling hand,
took it within his own, and carried it so respectfully to his
lips, that he might have been said to have deposited a sigh upon
it rather than a kiss.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                In the meantime,
Mademoiselle de Montalais had taken the letter, folded it
carefully, as women do, in three folds, and slipped it into her
bosom.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Don't be afraid, Louise,"
said she; "monsieur will no more venture to take it hence than
the defunct king Louis XIII. ventured to take billets from the
corsage of Mademoiselle de Hautefort."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Raoul blushed at seeing the
smile of the two girls; and he did not remark that the hand of
Louise remained in his.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "There!" said Montalais,
"you have pardoned me, Louise, for having brought monsieur to
you; and you, monsieur, bear me no malice for having followed me
to see mademoiselle.  Now, then, peace being made, let us chat
like old friends.  Present me, Louise, to M. de Bragelonne."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur le Vicomte," said
Louise, with her quiet grace and ingenuous smile, "I have the
honor to present to you Mademoiselle Aure de Montalais, maid of
honor to her royal highness MADAME, and moreover my friend - my
excellent friend."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Raoul bowed
ceremoniously.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And me, Louise," said he -
"will you not present me also to mademoiselle?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, she knows you - she
knows all!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This unguarded expression
made Montalais laugh and Raoul sigh with happiness, for he
interpreted it thus: "<i>She knows all our love</i>."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The ceremonies being over,
Monsieur le Vicomte," said Montalais, "take a chair, and tell us
quickly the news you bring flying thus."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Mademoiselle, it is no
longer a secret; the king, on his way to Poitiers, will stop at
Blois, to visit his royal highness."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The king here!" exclaimed
Montalais, clapping her hands.  "What! are we going to see the
court?  Only think, Louise - the real court from Paris!  Oh, good
heavens!  But when will this happen, monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Perhaps this evening,
mademoiselle; at latest, to-morrow."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Montalais lifted her
shoulders in a sigh of vexation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No time to get ready!  No
time to prepare a single dress!  We are as far behind the
fashions as the Poles.  We shall look like portraits from the
time of Henry IV.  Ah, monsieur! this is sad news you bring
us!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But, mesdemoiselles, you
will be still beautiful!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That's no news!  Yes, we
shall always be beautiful, because nature has made us passable;
but we shall be ridiculous, because the fashion will have
forgotten us.  Alas! ridiculous!  I shall be thought ridiculous -
I!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And by whom?" said Louise,
innocently.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "By whom?  You are a strange
girl, my dear.  Is that a question to put to me?  I mean
everybody; I mean the courtiers, the nobles; I mean the
king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Pardon me, my good friend;
but as here every one is accustomed to see us as we are - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Granted; but that is about
to change, and we shall be ridiculous, even for Blois; for close
to us will be seen the fashions from Paris, and they will
perceive that we are in the fashion of Blois!  It is enough to
make one despair!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Console yourself,
mademoiselle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, so let it be!  After
all, so much the worse for those who do not find me to their
taste!" said Montalais, philosophically.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "They would be very
difficult to please," replied Raoul, faithful to his regular
system of gallantry.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thank you,  Monsieur le
Vicomte.  We were saying, then, that the king is coming to
Blois?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "With all the court."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Mesdemoiselles de Mancini,
will they be with them?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, certainly not."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But as the king, it is
said, cannot do without Mademoiselle Mary?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Mademoiselle, the king must
do without her.  M. le Cardinal will have it so.  He has exiled
his nieces to Brouage."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He! - the hypocrite!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Hush!" said Louise,
pressing a finger on her friend's rosy lips.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bah! nobody can hear me.  I
say that old Mazarino Mazarini is a hypocrite, who burns
impatiently to make his niece Queen of France."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That cannot be,
mademoiselle, since M. le Cardinal, on the contrary, had brought
about the marriage of his majesty with the Infanta Maria
Theresa."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Montalais looked Raoul full
in the face, and said, "And do you Parisians believe in these
tales?  Well! we are a little more knowing than you, at
Blois."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Mademoiselle, if the king
goes beyond Poitiers and sets out for Spain; if the articles of
the marriage contract are agreed upon by Don Luis de Haro and his
eminence, you must plainly perceive that it is not child's
play."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "All very fine! but the king
is king, I suppose?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No doubt, mademoiselle; but
the cardinal is the cardinal."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The king is not a man,
then!  And he does not love Mary Mancini?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He adores her."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, he will marry her
then.  We shall have war with Spain.  M. Mazarin will spend a few
of the millions he has put away; our gentlemen will perform
prodigies of valor in their encounters with the proud Castilians,
and many of them will return crowned with laurels, to be
recrowned by us with myrtles.  Now, that is my view of
politics."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Montalais, you are wild!"
said Louise, "and every exaggeration attracts you as light does a
moth."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Louise, you are so
extremely reasonable, that you will never know how to love."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!" said Louise, in a tone
of tender reproach, "don't you see, Montalais?  The queen-mother
desires to marry her son to the Infanta; would you wish him to
disobey his mother?  Is it for a royal heart like his to set such
a bad example?  When parents forbid love, love must be
banished."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                And Louise sighed: Raoul
cast down his eyes, with an expression of constraint.  Montalais,
on her part, laughed aloud.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, I have no parents!"
said she.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are acquainted, without
doubt, with the state of health of M. le Comte de la
F&egrave;re?" said Louise, after breathing that sigh which had
revealed so many griefs in its eloquent utterance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, mademoiselle," replied
Raoul, "I have not let paid my respects to my father; I was going
to his house when Mademoiselle de Montalais so kindly stopped
me.  I hope the comte is well.  You have heard nothing to the
contrary, have you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, M. Raoul - nothing,
thank God!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Here, for several instants,
ensued a silence, during which two spirits, which followed the
same idea, communicated perfectly, without even the assistance of
a single glance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, heavens!" exclaimed
Montalais in a fright; "there is somebody coming up."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who can it be?" said
Louise, rising in great agitation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Mesdemoiselles, I
inconvenience you very much.  I have, without doubt, been very
indiscreet," stammered Raoul, very ill at ease.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is a heavy step," said
Louise.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! if it is only M.
Malicorne," added Montalais, "do not disturb yourselves."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louise and Raoul looked at
each other to inquire who M. Malicorne could be.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "There is no occasion to
mind him," continued Montalais; "he is not jealous."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But, mademoiselle - "said
Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, I understand.  Well,
he is discreet as I am."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good heavens!" cried
Louise, who had applied her ear to the door, which had been left
ajar; "it is my mother's step!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Madame de
Saint-R&eacute;my!  Where shall I hide myself?" exclaimed Raoul,
catching at the dress of Montalais, who looked quite
bewildered.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes," said she; "yes, I
know the clicking of those pattens!  It is our excellent mother. 
M. le Vicomte, what a pity it is the window looks upon a stone
pavement, and that fifty paces below it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Raoul glanced at the balcony
in despair.  Louise seized his arm and held it tight.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, how silly I am!" said
Montalais; "have I not the robe-of-ceremony closet?  It looks as
if it were made on purpose."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                It was quite time to act;
Madame de Saint-R&eacute;my was coming up at a quicker pace than
usual.  She gained the landing at the moment when Montalais, as
in all scenes of surprises, shut the closet by leaning with her
back against the door.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah!" cried Madame de
Saint-R&eacute;my, "you are here, are you, Louise?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, madame," replied she,
more pale than if she had committed a great crime.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, well!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Pray be seated, madame,"
said Montalais, offering her a chair, which she placed so that
the back was towards the closet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thank you, Mademoiselle
Aure - thank you.  Come, my child, be quick."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Where do you wish me to go,
madame?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, home, to be sure; have
you not to prepare your toilette?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What did you say?" cried
Montalais, hastening to affect surprise, so fearful was she that
Louise would in some way commit herself.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You don't know the news,
then?" said Madame de Saint-R&eacute;my.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What news, madame, is it
possible for two girls to learn up in this dove-cote?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What! have you seen
nobody?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Madame, you talk in
enigmas, and you torment us at a  slow fire!" cried Montalais,
who, terrified at seeing Louise become paler and paler, did not
know to what saint to put up her vows.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                At length she caught an
eloquent look of her companion's, one of those looks which would
convey intelligence to a brick wall.  Louise directed her
attention to a hat - Raoul's unlucky hat, which was set out in
all its feathery splendor upon the table.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Montalais sprang towards it,
and, seizing it with her left hand, passed it behind her into the
right, concealing it as she was speaking.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well," said Madame de
Saint-R&eacute;my, "a courier has arrived, announcing the
approach of the king.  There, mesdemoiselles; there is something
to make you put on your best looks."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Quick, quick!" cried
Montalais.  "Follow Madame your mother, Louise; and leave me to
get ready my dress of ceremony."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louise arose; her mother
took her by the hand, and led her out on to the landing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Come along," said she; then
adding in a low voice, "When I forbid you to come the apartment
of Montalais, why do you do so?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Madame, she is my friend. 
Besides, I had but just come."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Did you see nobody
concealed while you were there?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Madame!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I saw a man's hat, I tell
you - the hat of that fellow, that good-for-nothing!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Madame!" repeated
Louise.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Of that do-nothing
Malicorne!  A maid of honor to have such company - fie! fie!" and
their voices were lost in the depths of the narrow staircase.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Montalais had not missed a
word of this conversation, which echo conveyed to her as if
through a tunnel.  She shrugged her shoulders on seeing Raoul,
who had listened likewise, issue from the closet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Poor Montalais!" said she,
"the victim of friendship!  Poor Malicorne, the victim of
love!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                She stopped on viewing the
tragic-comic face of Raoul, who was vexed at having, in one day,
surprised so many secrets.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, mademoiselle!" said he;
"how can we repay your kindness?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, we will balance
accounts some day," said she.  "For the present, begone, M. de
Bragelonne, for Madame de Saint-R&eacute;my is not over
indulgent; and any indiscretion on her part might bring hither a
domiciliary visit, which would be disagreeable to all
parties."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But Louise - how shall I
know - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Begone! begone!  King Louis
XI. knew very well what he was about when he invented the
post."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Alas!" sighed Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And am I not here - I, who
am worth all the posts in the kingdom?  Quick, I say, to horse!
so that if Madame de Saint-R&eacute;my should return for the
purpose of preaching me a lesson on morality, she may not find
you here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "She would tell my father,
would she not?" murmured Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you would be scolded. 
Ah, vicomte, it is very plain you come from court; you are as
timid as the king.  <i>Peste!</i> at Blois we contrive better
than that, to do without papa's consent.  Ask Malicorne
else!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                And at these words the girl
pushed Raoul out of the room by the shoulders.  He glided swiftly
down to the porch, regained his horse, mounted, and set off as if
he had had Monsieur's guards at his heels.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>R</span>aoul followed
the well-known road, so dear to his memory, which led from Blois
to the residence of the Comte de la F&egrave;re.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The reader will dispense
with a second description of that habitation: he, perhaps, has
been with us there before, and knows it.  Only, since our last
journey thither, the walls had taken on a grayer tint, and the
brick-work assumed a more harmonious copper tone; the trees had
grown, and many that then only stretched their slender branches
along the tops of the hedges, now, bushy, strong, and luxuriant,
cast around, beneath boughs swollen with sap, great shadows of
blossoms or fruit for the benefit of the traveler.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Raoul perceived, from a
distance, the two little turrets, the dove-cote in the elms, and
the flights of pigeons, which wheeled incessantly around that
brick cone, seemingly without power to quit it, like the sweet
memories which hover round a spirit at peace.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                As he approached, he heard
the noise of the pulleys which grated under the weight of the
heavy pails; he also fancied he heard the melancholy moaning of
the water which falls back again into the wells - a sad,
funereal, solemn sound, which strikes the ear of the child and
the poet - both dreamers - which the English call <i>splash</i>;
Arabian poets <i>gasgachau</i>; and which we Frenchmen, who would
be poets, can only translate by a paraphrase - <i>the noise of
water falling into water</i>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                It was more than a year
since Raoul had been to visit his father.  He had passed the
whole time in the household of M. le Prince.  In fact, after all
the commotions of the Fronde, of the early period of which we
formerly attempted to give a sketch, Louis de Cond&eacute; had
made a public, solemn and frank reconciliation with the court. 
During all the time that the rupture between the king and the
prince had lasted, the prince, who had long entertained a great
regard for Bragelonne, had in vain offered him advantages of the
most dazzling kind for a young man.  The Comte de la F&egrave;re,
still faithful to his principles of loyalty, and royalty, one day
developed before his son in the vaults of Saint Denis, - the
Comte de la F&egrave;re, in the name of his son, had always
declined them.  Moreover, instead of following M. de Cond&eacute;
in his rebellion, the vicomte had followed M. de Turenne,
fighting for the king.  Then when M. de Turenne, in his turn, had
appeared to abandon the royal cause, he had quitted M. de
Turenne, as he had quitted M. de Cond&eacute;.  It resulted from
this invariable line of conduct, that, as Cond&eacute; and
Turenne had never been conquerors of each other but under the
standard of the king, Raoul, however young, had ten victories
inscribed on his list of services, and not one defeat from which
his bravery or conscience had to suffer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Raoul, therefore, had, in
compliance with the wish of his father, served obstinately and
passively the fortunes of Louis XIV., in spite of the
tergiversations which were endemic, and, it might be said,
inevitable, at that period.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                M. de Cond&eacute;; on being
restored to favor, had at once availed himself of all the
privileges of the amnesty to ask for many things back again which
had been granted to him before, and among others, Raoul.  M. de
la F&egrave;re, with his invariable good sense, had immediately
sent him again to the prince.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                A year, then, had passed
away since the separation of the father and son; a few letters
had softened, but not removed, the pain of absence.  We have seen
that Raoul had left at Blois another love in addition to filial
love.  But let us do him this justice - if it had not been for
chance and Mademoiselle de Montalais, two great temptations,
Raoul, after delivering his message, would have galloped off
towards his father's house, turning his head round, perhaps, but
without stopping for a single instant, even if Louise had held
out her arms to him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                So the first part of the
journey was given by Raoul to regretting the past which he had
been forced to quit so quickly, that is to say, his lady-love;
and the other part to the friend he was about to join, so much
too slowly for his wishes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Raoul found the garden-gate
open, and rode straight in, without regarding the long arms,
raised in anger, of an old man dressed in a jacket of
violet-colored wool, and a large cap of faded velvet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The old man, who was weeding
with his hands a bed of dwarf roses and marguerites, was
indignant at seeing a horse thus traversing his sanded and
nicely-raked walks.  He even ventured a vigorous "Humph!" which
made the cavalier turn round.  Then there was a change of scene;
for no sooner had he caught sight of Raoul's face, than the old
man sprang up and set off in the direction of the house, amidst
interrupted growlings, which appeared to be paroxysms of wild
delight.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                When arrived at the stables,
Raoul gave his horse to a little lackey, and sprang up the
<i>perron</i> with an ardor that would have delighted the heart
of his father.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                He crossed the ante-chamber,
the dining-room, and the <i>salon</i>, without meeting any one;
at length, on reaching the door of M. de la F&egrave;re's
apartment, he rapped impatiently, and entered almost without
waiting for the word "Enter!" which was vouchsafed him by a voice
at once sweet and serious.  The comte was seated at a table
covered with papers and books; he was still the noble, handsome
gentleman of former days, but time had given to this nobleness
and beauty a more solemn and distinct character.  A brow white
and void of wrinkles, beneath his long hair, now more white than
black; an eye piercing and mild, under the lids of a young man;
his mustache, fine but slightly grizzled, waved over lips of a
pure and delicate model, as if they had never been curled by
mortal passions; a form straight and supple; an irreproachable
but thin hand - this was what remained of the illustrious
gentleman whom so many illustrious mouths had praised under the
name of Athos.  He was engaged in correcting the pages of a
manuscript book, entirely filled by his own hand.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Raoul seized his father by
the shoulders, by the neck, as he could, and embraced him so
tenderly and so rapidly, that the comte had neither strength nor
time to disengage himself, or to overcome his paternal
emotions.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What! you here, Raoul -
you!  Is it possible?" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, monsieur, monsieur,
what joy to see you once again!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But you don't answer me,
vicomte.  Have you leave of absence, or has some misfortune
happened at Paris?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thank God, monsieur,"
replied Raoul, calming himself by degrees, "nothing has happened
but what is fortunate.  The king is going to be married, as I had
the honor of informing you in my last letter, and, on his way to
Spain, he will pass through Blois."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To pay a visit to
Monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur le comte. 
So, fearing to find him unprepared, or wishing to be particularly
polite to him, monsieur le prince sent me forward to have the
lodgings ready."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You have seen Monsieur?"
asked the comte, eagerly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have had that honor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "At the castle?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur," replied
Raoul, casting down his eyes, because, no doubt, he had felt
there was something more than curiosity in the comte's
inquiries.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, indeed, vicomte? 
Accept my compliments thereupon."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Raoul bowed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But you have seen some one
else at Blois?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, I saw her royal
highness, Madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That's very well: but it is
not Madame that I mean."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Raoul colored deeply, but
made no reply.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You do not appear to
understand me, monsieur le vicomte," persisted M. de la
F&egrave;re, without accenting his words more strongly, but with
a rather severer look.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I understand you quite
plainly, monsieur," replied Raoul, "and if I hesitate a little in
my reply, you are well assured I am not seeking for a
falsehood."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, you cannot tell a lie;
and that makes me so astonished you should be so long in saying
yes or no."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I cannot answer you without
understanding you very well; and if I have understood you, you
will take my first words in ill part.  You will displeased, no
doubt, monsieur le comte, because I have seen - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Mademoiselle de la
Valli&egrave;re - have you not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It was of her you meant to
speak, I know very well, monsieur," said Raoul, with
inexpressible sweetness.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And I asked you if you have
seen her."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, I was ignorant,
when I entered the castle, that Mademoiselle de la
Valli&egrave;re was there; it was only on my return, after I had
performed my mission, that chance brought us together.  I have
had the honor of paying my respects to her."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But what do you call the
chance that led you into the presence of Mademoiselle de la
Valli&egrave;re?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Mademoiselle de Montalais,
monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And who is Mademoiselle de
Montalais?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A young lady I did not know
before, whom I had never seen.  She is maid of honor to
Madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur le vicomte, I will
push my interrogatory no further, and reproach myself with having
carried it so far.  I had desired you to avoid Mademoiselle de la
Valli&egrave;re, and not to see her without my permission.  Oh, I
am quite sure you have told me the truth, and that you took no
measures to approach her.  Chance has done me this injury; I do
not accuse you of it.  I will be content, then, with what I
formerly said to you concerning this young lady.  I do not
reproach her with anything - God is my witness! only it is not my
intention or wish that you should frequent her place of
residence.  I beg you once more, my dear Raoul, to understand
that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                It was plain the limpid eyes
of Raoul were troubled at this speech.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Now, my friend," said the
comte, with his soft smile, and in his customary tone, "let us
talk of other matters.  You are returning, perhaps, to your
duty?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, monsieur, I have no
duty for to-day, except the pleasure of remaining with you.  The
prince kindly appointed me no other: which was so much in accord
with my wish."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is the king well?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Perfectly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And monsieur le prince
also?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "As usual, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The comte forgot to inquire
after Mazarin; that was an old habit.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, Raoul, since you are
entirely mine, I will give up my whole day to you.  Embrace me -
again, again!  You are at home, vicomte!  Ah, there is our old
Grimaud!  Come in, Grimaud: monsieur le vicomte is desirous of
embracing you likewise."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The good old man did not
require to be twice told; he rushed in with open arms, Raoul
meeting him half-way.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Now, if you please, we will
go into the garden, Raoul.  I will show you the new lodging I
have had prepared for you during your leave of absence; and
whilst examining the last winter's plantations, and two
saddle-horses I have just acquired, you will give me all the news
of our friends in Paris."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The comte closed his
manuscript, took the young man's arm, and went out into the
gardens with him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Grimaud looked at Raoul with
a melancholy air as the young man passed out; observing that his
head nearly touched the <i>traverse</i> of the doorway, stroking
his white <i>royale</i>, he slowly murmured:-</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How he has grown!"</p>

has erected, and the new horses he has bought, with the reader's
permission we will lead him back to the city of Blois, and make
him a witness of the unaccustomed activity which pervades that
city.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                It was in the hotels that
the surprise of the news brought by Raoul was most sensibly
felt.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                In fact, the king and the
court at Blois, that is to say, a hundred horsemen, ten
carriages, two hundred horses, as many lackeys as masters - where
was this crowd to be housed?  Where were to be lodged all the
gentry of the neighborhood, who would gather in two or three
hours after the news had enlarged the circle of its report, like
the increasing circumferences produced by a stone thrown into a
placid lake?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Blois, as peaceful in the
morning, as we have seen, as the calmest lake in the world, at
the announcement of the royal arrival, was suddenly filled with
the tumult and buzzing of a swarm of bees.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                All the servants of the
castle, under the inspection of the officers, were sent into the
city in quest of provisions, and ten horsemen were dispatched to
the preserves of Chambord to seek for game, to the fisheries of
Beuvron for fish, and to the gardens of Cheverny for fruits and
flowers.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Precious tapestries, and
lusters with great gilt chains, were drawn from the cupboards; an
army of the poor were engaged in sweeping the courts and washing
the stone fronts, whilst their wives went in droves to the
meadows beyond the Loire, to gather green boughs and
field-flowers.  The whole city, not to be behind in this luxury
of cleanliness, assumed its best toilette with the help of
brushes, brooms, and water.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The gutters of the upper
town, swollen by these continued ablutions, became rivers at the
bottom of the city, and the pavement, generally very muddy, it
must be allowed, took a clean face, and absolutely shone in the
friendly rays of the sun.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Next the music was to be
provided; drawers were emptied; the shop-keepers did a glorious
trade in wax, ribbons, and sword-knots; housekeepers laid in
stores of bread, meat, and spices.  Already numbers of the
citizens whose houses were furnished as if for a siege, having
nothing more to do, donned their festive clothes, and directed
their course towards the city gate, in order to be the first to
signal or see the <i>cort&eacute;ge</i>.  They knew very well
that the king would not arrive before night, perhaps not before
the next morning.  Yet what is expectation but a kind of folly,
and what is that folly but an excess of hope?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                In the lower city, at
scarcely a hundred paces from the Castle of the States, between
the mall and the castle, in a sufficiently handsome street, then
called the Rue Vieille, and which must, in fact, have been very
old, stood a venerable edifice, with pointed gables, of squat but
large dimensions, ornamented with three windows looking into the
street on the first floor, with two in the second, and with a
little <i>&oelig;il de b&oelig;uf</i> in the third.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                On the sides of this
triangle had recently been constructed a parallelogram of
considerable size, which encroached upon the street
remorselessly, according to the familiar uses of the building of
that period.  The street was narrowed by a quarter by it, but
then the house was enlarged by a half; and was not that a
sufficient compensation?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Tradition said that this
house with the pointed gables was inhabited, in the time of Henry
III., by a councilor of state whom Queen Catherine came, some say
to visit, and others to strangle.  However that may be, the good
lady must have stepped with a circumspect foot over the threshold
of this building.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                After the councilor had died
- whether by strangulation or naturally is of no consequence -
the house had been sold, then abandoned, and lastly isolated from
the other houses of the street.  Towards the middle of the reign
of Louis XIII. only, an Italian named Cropoli, escaped from the
kitchens of the Mar&eacute;chal d'Ancre, came and took possession
of this house.  There he established a little hostelry, in which
was fabricated a macaroni so delicious that people came from
miles round to fetch it or eat it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                So famous had the house
become for it, that when Mary de Medici was a prisoner, as we
know, in the castle of Blois, she once sent for some.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                It was precisely on the day
she had escaped by the famous window.  The dish of macaroni was
left upon the table, only just tasted by the royal mouth.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This double favor, of a
strangulation and a macaroni, conferred upon the triangular
house, gave poor Cropoli a fancy to grace his hostelry with a
pompous title.  But his quality of an Italian was no
recommendation in these times, and his small, well-concealed
fortune forbade attracting too much attention.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                When he found himself about
to die, which happened in 1643, just after the death of Louis
XIII., he called to him his son, a young cook of great promise,
and with tears in his eyes, he recommended him to preserve
carefully the secret of the macaroni, to Frenchify his name, and
at length, when the political horizon should be cleared from the
clouds which obscured it - this was practiced then as in our day,
to order of the nearest smith a handsome sign, upon which a
famous painter, whom he named, should design two queens'
portraits, with these words as a legend: "TO THE MEDICI."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The worthy Cropoli, after
these recommendations, had only sufficient time to point out to
his young successor a chimney, under the slab of which he had
hidden a thousand ten-franc pieces, and then expired.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Cropoli the younger, like a
man of good heart, supported the loss with resignation, and the
gain without insolence.  He began by accustoming the public to
sound the final <i>i</i> of his name so little, that by the aid
of general complaisance, he was soon called nothing but M.
Cropol&eacute;, which is quite a French name.  He then married,
having had in his eye a little French girl, from whose parents he
extorted a reasonable dowry by showing them what there was
beneath the slab of the chimney.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                These two points
accomplished, he went in search of the painter who was to paint
the sign; and he was soon found.  He was an old Italian, a rival
of the Raphaels and the Caracci, but an unfortunate rival.  He
said he was of the Venetian school, doubtless from his fondness
for color.  His works, of which he had never sold one, attracted
the eye at a distance of a hundred paces; but they so formidably
displeased the citizens, that he had finished by painting no
more.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                He boasted of having painted
a bath-room for Madame la Mar&eacute;chale d'Ancre, and mourned
over this chamber having been burnt at the time of the
mar&eacute;chal's disaster.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Cropoli, in his character of
a compatriot, was indulgent towards Pittrino, which was the name
of the artist.  Perhaps he had seen the famous pictures of the
bath-room.  Be this as it may, he held in such esteem, we may say
in such friendship, the famous Pittrino, that he took him in his
own house.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Pittrino, grateful, and fed
with macaroni, set about propagating the reputation of this
national dish, and from the time of its founder, he had rendered,
with his indefatigable tongue, signal services to the house of
Cropoli.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                As he grew old he attached
himself to the son as he had done to the father, and by degrees
became a kind of over-looker of a house in which his remarkable
integrity, his acknowledged sobriety, and a thousand other
virtues useless to enumerate, gave him an eternal place by the
fireside, with a right of inspection over the domestics.  Besides
this, it was he who tasted the macaroni, to maintain the pure
flavor of the ancient tradition; and it must be allowed that he
never permitted a grain of pepper too much, or an atom of
parmesan too little.  His joy was at its height on that day when
called upon to share the secret of Cropoli the younger, and to
paint the famous sign.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                He was seen at once
rummaging with ardor in an old box, in which he found some
brushes, a little gnawed by the rats, but still passable; some
linseed-oil in a bottle, and a palette which had formerly
belonged to Bronzino, that <i>dieu de la pittoure</i>, as the
ultramontane artist, in his ever young enthusiasm, always called
him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Pittrino was puffed up with
all the joy of a rehabilitation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                He did as Raphael had done-
he changed his style, and painted, in the fashion of Albani, two
goddesses rather than two queens.  These illustrious ladies
appeared so lovely on the sign, - they presented to the
astonished eyes such an assemblage of lilies and roses, the
enchanting result of the changes of style in Pittrino - they
assumed the <i>poses</i> of sirens so Anacreontically - that the
principal <i>&eacute;chevin</i>, when admitted to view this
capital piece in the <i>salle</i> of Cropol&eacute;, at once
declared that these ladies were too handsome, of too animated a
beauty, to figure as a sign in the eyes of passers-by.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                To Pittrino he added, "His
royal highness, Monsieur, who often comes into our city, will not
be much pleased to see his illustrious mother so slightly
clothed, and he will send you to the <i>oubliettes</i> of the
state; for, remember, the heart of that glorious prince is not
always tender.  You must efface either the two sirens or the
legend, without which I forbid the exhibition of the sign.  I say
this for your sake, Master Cropol&eacute;, as well for yours,
Signor Pittrino."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                What answer could be made to
this?  It was necessary to thank the <i>&eacute;chevin</i> for
his kindness, which Cropol&eacute; did.  But Pittrino remained
downcast and said he felt assured of what was about to
happen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The visitor was scarcely
gone when Cropol&eacute;, crossing his arms, said: "Well, master,
what is to be done?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "We must efface the legend,"
said Pittrino, in a melancholy tone.  "I have some excellent
ivory-black; it will be done in a moment, and we will replace the
Medici by the nymphs or the sirens, whichever you prefer."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No," said Cropol&eacute;,
"the will of my father must be carried out.  My father considered
- "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He considered the figures
of the most importance," said Pittrino.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He thought most of the
legend," said Cropol&eacute;.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The proof of the importance
in which he held the figures," said Pittrino, "is that he desired
they should be likenesses, and they are so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes; but if they had not
been so, who would have recognized them without the legend?  At
the present day even, when the memory of the Blaisois begins to
be faint with regard to these two celebrated persons, who would
recognize Catherine and Mary without the words '<i>To the
Medici</i>'?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But the figures?" said
Pittrino, in despair; for he felt that young Cropol&eacute; was
right.  "I should not like to lose the fruit of my labor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And I should not wish you
to be thrown into prison, and myself into the
<i>oubliettes</i>."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Let us efface 'Medici',"
said Pittrino, supplicatingly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No," replied
Cropol&eacute;, firmly.  "I have got an idea, a sublime idea -
your picture shall appear, and my legend likewise.  Does not
'Medici' mean doctor, or physician, in Italian?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, in the plural."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, then, you shall order
another sign-frame of the smith; you shall paint six physicians,
and write underneath '<i>Aux Medici</i>' which makes a very
pretty play upon words."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Six physicians!
impossible!  And the composition?" cried Pittrino.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is your business - but
so it shall be - I insist upon it - it must be so - my macaroni
is burning."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This reasoning was
peremptory - Pittrino obeyed.  He composed the sign of six
physicians, with the legend; the <i>&eacute;chevin</i> applauded
and authorized it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The sign produced an
extravagant success in the city, which proves that poetry has
always been in the wrong, before citizens, as Pittrino said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Cropol&eacute;, to make
amends to his painter-in-ordinary, hung up the nymphs of the
preceding sign in his bedroom, which made Madame Cropol&eacute;
blush every time she looked at it, when she was undressing at
night.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This is the way in which the
pointed-gable house got a sign; and this is how the hostelry of
the Medici, making a fortune, was found to be enlarged by a
quarter, as we have described.  And this is how there was at
Blois a hostelry of that name, and had for a painter-in-ordinary
Master Pittrino.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Cropol&eacute; was anxious
for gain, and was half-crazy with joy at the news of the arrival
of Louis XIV.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Himself, his wife, Pittrino,
and two cooks, immediately laid hands upon all the inhabitants of
the dove-cote, the poultry-yard, and the rabbit-hutches; so that
as many lamentations and cries resounded in the yards of the
hostelry of the Medici as were formerly heard in Rama.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Cropol&eacute; had, at the
time, but one single traveler in his house.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This was a man of scarcely
thirty years of age, handsome, tall, austere, or rather
melancholy, in all his gestures and looks.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                He was dressed in black
velvet with jet trimmings; a white collar, as plain as that of
the severest Puritan, set off the whiteness of his youthful neck;
a small dark-colored mustache scarcely covered his curled,
disdainful lip.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                He spoke to people looking
them full in the face, without affectation, it is true, but
without scruple; so that the brilliancy of his black eyes became
so insupportable, that more than one look had sunk beneath his,
like the weaker sword in a single combat.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                At this time, in which men,
all created equal by God, were divided, thanks to prejudices,
into two distinct castes, the gentlemen and the commoner, as they
are really divided into two races, the black and the white, - at
this time, we say, he whose portrait we have just sketched could
not fail of being taken for a gentleman, and of the best class. 
To ascertain this, there was no necessity to consult anything but
his hands, long, slender, and white, of which every muscle, every
vein, became apparent through the skin at the least movement, and
eloquently spoke of good descent.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This gentleman, then, had
arrived alone at Cropol&eacute;'s house.  He had taken, without
hesitation, without reflection even, the principal apartment
which the <i>h&ocirc;telier</i> had pointed out to him with a
rapacious aim, very praiseworthy, some will say, very
reprehensible will say others, if they admit that Cropol&eacute;
was a physiognomist, and judged people at first sight.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This apartment was that
which composed the whole front of the ancient triangular house; a
large <i>salon</i>, lighted by two windows on the first stage, a
small chamber by the side of it, and another above it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Now, from the time he had
arrived, this gentleman had scarcely touched any repast that had
been served up to him in his chamber.  He had spoken but two
words to the host, to warn him that a traveler of the name of
Parry would arrive, and to desire that, when he did, he should be
shown up to him immediately.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                He afterwards preserved so
profound a silence, that Cropol&eacute; was almost offended, so
much did he prefer people who were good company.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This gentleman had risen
early the morning of the day on which this history begins, and
had placed himself at the window of his <i>salon</i>, seated upon
the ledge, and leaning upon the rail of the balcony, gazing sadly
but persistently on both sides of the street, watching, no doubt,
for the arrival of the traveler he had mentioned to the host.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                In this way he had seen the
little <i>cort&eacute;ge</i> of Monsieur return from hunting,
then had again partaken of the profound tranquillity of the
street, absorbed in his own expectations.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                All at once the movement of
the crowd going to the meadows, couriers setting out, washers of
pavement, purveyors of the royal household, gabbling, scampering
shop-boys, chariots in motion, hair-dressers on the run, and
pages toiling along, this tumult and bustle had surprised him,
but without losing any of that impassible and supreme majesty
which gives to the eagle and the lion that serene and
contemptuous glance amidst the hurrahs and shouts of hunters or
the curious.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Soon the cries of the
victims slaughtered in the poultry-yard, the hasty steps of
Madame Cropol&eacute; up that little wooden staircase, so narrow
and so echoing; the bounding pace of Pittrino, who only that
morning was smoking at the door with all the phlegm of a
Dutchman; all this communicated something like surprise and
agitation to the traveler.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                As he was rising to make
inquiries, the door of his chamber opened.  The unknown concluded
they were about to introduce the impatiently expected traveler,
and made three precipitate steps to meet him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                But, instead of the person
he expected, it was Master Cropol&eacute; who appeared, and
behind him, in the half-dark staircase, the pleasant face of
Madame Cropol&eacute;&sbquo; rendered trivial by curiosity.  She
only gave one furtive glance at the handsome gentleman, and
disappeared.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Cropol&eacute; advanced, cap
in hand, rather bent than bowing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                A gesture of the unknown
interrogated him, without a word being pronounced.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," said
Cropol&eacute;&sbquo; "I come to ask how - what ought I to say:
your lordship, monsieur le comte, or monsieur le marquis?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Say <i>monsieur</i>, and
speak quickly," replied the unknown, with that haughty accent
which admits of neither discussion nor reply.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I came, then, to inquire
how monsieur had passed the night, and if monsieur intended to
keep this apartment?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, something has
happened upon which we could not reckon."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "His majesty Louis XIV. will
enter our city to-day, and will remain here one day, perhaps
two."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Great astonishment was
painted on the countenance of the unknown.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The King of France is
coming to Blois?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He is on the road,
monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then there is the stronger
reason for my remaining," said the unknown.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very well; but will
monsieur keep all the apartments?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I do not understand you. 
Why should I require less to-day than yesterday?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Because, monsieur, your
lordship will permit me to say, yesterday I did not think proper,
when you chose your lodging, to fix any price that might have
made your lordship believe that I prejudged your resources;
whilst to-day - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The unknown colored; the
idea at once struck him that he was supposed to be poor, and was
being insulted.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Whilst to-day," replied he,
coldly, "you do not prejudge."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, I am a
well-meaning man, thank God! and simple <i>h&ocirc;telier</i> as
I am, there is in me the blood of a gentleman.  My father was a
servant and officer of the late Mar&eacute;chal d'Ancre.  God
rest his soul!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I do not contest that point
with you; I only wish to know, and that quickly, to what your
questions tend?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are too reasonable,
monsieur, not to comprehend that our city is small, that the
court is about to invade it, that the houses will be overflowing
with inhabitants, and that lodgings will consequently obtain
considerable prices."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Again the unknown colored. 
"Name your terms," said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I name them with scruple,
monsieur, because I seek an honest gain, and that I wish to carry
on my business without being uncivil or extravagant in my
demands.  Now the room you occupy is considerable, and you are
alone."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is my business."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! certainly.  I do not
mean to turn monsieur out."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The blood rushed to the
temples of the unknown; he darted at poor Cropol&eacute;&sbquo;
the descendant of one of the officers of the Mar&eacute;chal
d'Ancre, a glance that would have crushed him down to beneath
that famous chimney-slab, if Cropol&eacute; had not been nailed
to the spot by the question of his own proper interests.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do you desire me to go?"
said he.  "Explain yourself - but quickly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, monsieur, you do
not understand me.  It is very critical - I know - that which I
am doing.  I express myself badly, or perhaps, as monsieur is a
foreigner, which I perceive by his accent - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                In fact, the unknown spoke
with that impetuosity which is the principal character of English
accentuation, even among men who speak the French language with
the greatest purity.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "As monsieur is a foreigner,
I say, it is perhaps he who does not catch my exact meaning.  I
wish for monsieur to give up one or two of the apartments he
occupies, which would diminish his expenses and ease my
conscience.  Indeed, it is hard to increase unreasonably the
price of the chambers, when one has had the honor to let them at
a reasonable price."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How much does the hire
amount to since yesterday?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, to one louis,
with refreshments and the charge for the horse."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very well; and that of
to-day?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! there is the
difficulty.  This is the day of the king's arrival; if the court
comes to sleep here, the charge of the day is reckoned.  From
that it results that three chambers, at two louis each, make six
louis.  Two louis, monsieur, are not much; but six louis make a
great deal."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The unknown, from red, as we
have seen him, became very pale.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                He drew from his pocket,
with heroic bravery, a purse embroidered with a coat-of-arms,
which he carefully concealed in the hollow of his hand.  This
purse was of a thinness, a flabbiness, a hollowness, which did
not escape the eye of Cropol&eacute;.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The unknown emptied the
purse into his hand.  It contained three double louis, which
amounted to the six louis demanded by the host.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                But it was seven that
Cropol&eacute; had required.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                He looked, therefore, at the
unknown, as much as to say, "And then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "There remains one louis,
does there not, master h&ocirc;telier?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur, but - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The unknown plunged his hand
into the pocket of his <i>haut-de-chausses</i>, and emptied it. 
It contained a small pocket-book, a gold key, and some silver. 
With this change, he made up a louis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thank you, monsieur," said
Cropol&eacute;.  "It now only remains for me to ask whether
monsieur intends to occupy his apartments to-morrow, in which
case I will reserve them for him; whereas, if monsieur does not
mean to do so, I will promise them to some of the king's people
who are coming."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is but right," said
the unknown, after a long silence; "but as I have no more money,
as you have seen, and as I yet must retain the apartments, you
must either sell this diamond in the city, or hold it in
pledge."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Cropol&eacute; looked at the
diamond so long, that the unknown said, hastily:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I prefer your selling it,
monsieur; for it is worth three hundred pistoles.  A Jew - are
there any Jews in Blois? - would give you two hundred or a
hundred and fifty for it - take whatever may be offered for it,
if it be no more than the price of your lodging.  Begone!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! monsieur," replied
Cropol&eacute;&sbquo; ashamed of the sudden inferiority which the
unknown reflected upon him by this noble and disinterested
confidence, as well as by the unalterable patience opposed to so
many suspicions and evasions.  "Oh, monsieur, I hope people are
not so dishonest at Blois as you seem to think; and that the
diamond, being worth what you say - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The unknown here again
darted at Cropol&eacute; one of his withering glances.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I really do not understand
diamonds, monsieur, I assure you," cried he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But the jewelers do: ask
them," said the unknown.  "Now I believe our accounts are
settled, are they not, monsieur l'h&ocirc;te?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur, and to my
profound regret; for I fear I have offended monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Not at all!" replied the
unknown, with ineffable majesty.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Or have appeared to be
extortionate with a noble traveler.  Consider, monsieur, the
peculiarity of the case."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Say no more about it, I
desire; and leave me to myself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Cropol&eacute; bowed
profoundly, and left the room with a stupefied air, which
announced that he had a good heart, and felt genuine remorse.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The unknown himself shut the
door after him, and, when left alone, looked mournfully at the
bottom of the purse, from which he had taken a small silken bag
containing the diamond, his last resource.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                He dwelt likewise upon the
emptiness of his pockets, turned over the papers in his
pocket-book, and convinced himself of the state of absolute
destitution in which he was about to be plunged.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                He raised his eyes towards
heaven, with a sublime emotion of despairing calmness, brushed
off with his hand some drops of sweat which trickled over his
noble brow, and then cast down upon the earth a look which just
before had been impressed with almost divine majesty.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                That the storm had passed
far from him, perhaps he had prayed in the bottom of his
soul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                He drew near to the window,
resumed his place in the balcony, and remained there, motionless,
annihilated, dead, till the moment when, the heavens beginning to
darken, the first flambeaux traversed the enlivened street, and
gave the signal for illumination to all the windows of the
city.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>W</span>hilst the
unknown was viewing these lights with interest, and lending an
ear to the various noises, Master Cropol&eacute; entered his
apartment, followed by two attendants, who laid the cloth for his
meal.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The stranger did not pay
them the least attention; but Cropol&eacute; approaching him
respectfully, whispered, "Monsieur, the diamond has been
valued."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah!" said the traveler. 
"Well?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, monsieur, the jeweler
of S. A. R. gives two hundred and eighty pistoles for it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Have you them?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I thought it best to take
them, monsieur; nevertheless, I made it a condition of the
bargain, that if monsieur wished to keep his diamond, it should
be held till monsieur was again in funds."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, no, not at all: I told
you to sell it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then I have obeyed, or
nearly so, since, without having definitely sold it, I have
touched the money."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Pay yourself," added the
unknown.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I will do so, monsieur,
since you so positively require it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                A sad smile passed over the
lips of the gentleman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Place the money on that
trunk," said he, turning round and pointing to the piece of
furniture.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Cropol&eacute; deposited a
tolerably large bag as directed, after having taken from it the
amount of his reckoning.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Now," said he, "I hope
monsieur will not give me the pain of not taking any supper. 
Dinner has already been refused; this is affronting to the house
of <i>les Medici</i>.  Look, monsieur, the supper is on the
table, and I venture to say that it is not a bad one."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The unknown asked for a
glass of wine, broke off a morsel of bread, and did not stir from
the window whilst he ate and drank.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Shortly after was heard a
loud flourish of trumpets; cries arose in the distance, a
confused buzzing filled the lower part of the city, and the first
distinct sound that struck the ears of the stranger was the tramp
of advancing horses.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The king! the king!"
repeated a noisy and eager crowd.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The king!" cried
Cropol&eacute;, abandoning his guest and his ideas of delicacy,
to satisfy his curiosity.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                With Cropol&eacute; were
mingled, and jostled, on the staircase, Madame Cropol&eacute;,
Pittrino, and the waiters and scullions.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The <i>cort&eacute;ge</i>
advanced slowly, lighted by a thousand flambeaux, in the streets
and from the windows.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                After a company of
musketeers, a closely ranked troop of gentlemen, came the litter
of monsieur le cardinal, drawn like a carriage by four black
horses.  The pages and people of the cardinal marched behind.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Next came the carriage of
the queen-mother, with her maids of honor at the doors, her
gentlemen on horseback at both sides.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king then appeared,
mounted upon a splendid horse of Saxon breed, with a flowing
mane.  The young prince exhibited, when bowing to some windows
from which issued the most animated acclamations, a noble and
handsome countenance, illuminated by the flambeaux of his
pages.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                By the side of the king,
though a little in the rear, the Prince de Cond&eacute;, M.
Dangeau, and twenty other courtiers, followed by their people and
their baggage, closed this veritably triumphant march.  The pomp
was of a military character.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Some of the courtiers - the
elder ones, for instance - wore traveling dresses; but all the
rest were clothed in warlike panoply.  Many wore the gorget and
buff coat of the times of Henry IV. and Louis XIII.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                When the king passed before
him, the unknown, who had leant forward over the balcony to
obtain a better view, and who had concealed his face by leaning
on his arm, felt his heart swell and overflow with a bitter
jealousy.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The noise of the trumpets
excited him - the popular acclamations deafened him: for a moment
he allowed his reason to be absorbed in this flood of lights,
tumult, and brilliant images.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He is a king!" murmured he,
in an accent of despair.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Then, before he had
recovered from his sombre reverie, all the noise, all the
splendor, had passed away.  At the angle of the street there
remained nothing beneath the stranger but a few hoarse,
discordant voices, shouting at intervals "<i>Vive le
Roi!</i>"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                There remained likewise the
six candles held by the inhabitants of the hostelry <i>des
Medici</i>; that is to say, two for Cropol&eacute;, two for
Pittrino, and one for each scullion.  Cropol&eacute; never ceased
repeating, "How good-looking the king is!  How strongly he
resembles his illustrious father!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A handsome likeness!" said
Pittrino.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And what a lofty carriage
he has!" added Madame Cropol&eacute;, already in promiscuous
commentary with her neighbors of both sexes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Cropol&eacute; was feeding
their gossip with his own personal remarks, without observing
that an old man on foot, but leading a small Irish horse by the
bridle, was endeavoring to penetrate the crowd of men and women
which blocked up the entrance to the <i>Medici</i>.  But at that
moment the voice of the stranger was heard from the window.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Make way, monsieur
l'h&ocirc;telier, to the entrance of your house!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Cropol&eacute; turned
around, and, on seeing the old man, cleared a passage for
him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The window was instantly
closed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Pittrino pointed out the way
to the newly-arrived guest, who entered without uttering a
word.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The stranger waited for him
on the landing; he opened his arms to the old man, and led him to
a seat.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, no, no, my lord!" said
he.  "Sit down in your presence? - never!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Parry," cried the
gentleman, "I beg you will; you come from England - you come so
far.  Ah! it is not for your age to undergo the fatigues my
service requires.  Rest yourself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have my reply to give
your lordship, in the first place."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Parry, I conjure you to
tell me nothing; for if your news had been good, you would not
have begun in such a manner; you go about, which proves that the
news is bad."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord," said the old man,
"do not hasten to alarm yourself; all is not lost, I hope.  You
must employ energy, but more particularly resignation."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Parry," said the young man,
"I have reached this place through a thousand snares and after a
thousand difficulties; can you doubt my energy?  I have meditated
this journey ten years, in spite of all counsels and all
obstacles - have you faith in my perseverance?  I have this
evening sold the last of my father's diamonds; for I had nothing
wherewith to pay for my lodgings and my host was about to turn me
out."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Parry made a gesture of
indignation, to which the young man replied by a pressure of the
hand and a smile.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have still two hundred
and seventy-four pistoles left and I feel myself rich.  I do not
despair, Parry; have you faith in my resignation?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The old man raised his
trembling hands towards heaven.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Let me know," said the
stranger, - "disguise nothing from me - what has happened?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My recital will be short,
my lord; but in the name of Heaven do not tremble so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is impatience, Parry. 
Come, what did the general say to you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "At first the general would
not receive me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He took you for a spy?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, my lord; but I wrote
him a letter."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He read it, and received
me, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Did that letter thoroughly
explain my position and my views?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, yes!" said Parry, with
a sad smile; "it painted your very thoughts faithfully."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well - then, Parry."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then the general sent me
back the letter by an aide-de-camp, informing me that if I were
found the next day within the circumscription of his command, he
would have me arrested."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Arrested!" murmured the
young man.  "What! arrest you, my most faithful servant?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And notwithstanding you had
signed the name <i>Parry</i>?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To all my letters, my lord;
and the aide-de-camp had known me at St. James's and at
Whitehall, too," added the old man with a sigh.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The young man leaned
forward, thoughtful and sad.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ay, that's what he did
before his people," said he, endeavoring to cheat himself with
hopes.  "But, privately - between you and him - what did he do?
Answer!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Alas! my lord, he sent to
me four cavaliers, who gave me the horse with which you just now
saw me come back.  These cavaliers conducted me, in great haste,
to the little port of Tenby, threw me, rather than embarked me,
into a little fishing-boat, about to sail for Brittany, and here
I am."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!" sighed the young man,
clasping his neck convulsively with his hand, and with a sob. 
"Parry, is that all? - is that all?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, my lord; that is
all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                After this brief reply
ensued a long interval of silence, broken only by the convulsive
beating of the heel of the young man on the floor.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The old man endeavored to
change the conversation; it was leading to thoughts much too
sinister.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord," said he, "what is
the meaning of all the noise which preceded me? What are these
people crying '<i>Vive le Roi</i>!' for?  What king do they mean?
and what are all these lights for?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah!  Parry," replied the
young man ironically, "don't you know that this is the King of
France visiting his good city of Blois? All these trumpets are
his, all those gilded housings are his, all those gentlemen wear
swords that are his.  His mother precedes him in a carriage
magnificently encrusted with silver and gold.  Happy mother!  His
minister heaps up millions, and conducts him to a rich bride. 
Then all these people rejoice; they love their king, they hail
him with their acclamations, and they cry, '<i>Vive le
Roi</i>!<i>  Vive le Roi</i>!'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, well, my lord," said
Parry, more uneasy at the turn the conversation had taken than at
the other.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You know," resumed the
unknown, "that <i>my</i> mother and <i>my</i> sister, whilst all
this is going on in honor of the King of France, have neither
money nor bread; you know that I myself shall be poor and
degraded within a fortnight, when all Europe will become
acquainted with what you have told me.  Parry, are there not
examples in which a man of my condition should himself - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord, in the name of
Heaven - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are right, Parry; I am
a coward, and if I do nothing for myself, what will God do?  No,
no; I have two arms, Parry, and I have a sword."  And he struck
his arm violently with his hand, and took down his sword, which
hung against the wall.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What are you going to do,
my lord?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What am I going to do,
Parry? What every one in my family does.  My mother lives on
public charity, my sister begs for my mother; I have, somewhere
or other, brothers who equally beg for themselves; and I, the
eldest, will go and do as all the rest do - I will go and ask
charity!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                And with these words, which
he finished sharply with a nervous and terrible laugh, the young
man girded on his sword, took his hat from the trunk, fastened to
his shoulder a black cloak, which he had worn all during his
journey, and pressing the two hands of the old man, who watched
his proceedings with a look of anxiety, -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"My good Parry,"
said he, "order a fire, drink, eat, sleep, and be happy; let us
both be happy, my faithful friend, my only friend.  We are rich,
as rich as kings!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                He struck the bag of
pistoles with his clenched hand as he spoke, and it fell heavily
to the ground.  He resumed that dismal laugh that had so alarmed
Parry; and whilst the whole household was screaming, singing, and
preparing to install the travelers who had been preceded by their
lackeys, he glided out by the principal entrance into the street,
where the old man, who had gone to the window, lost sight of him
in a moment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style='text-align:center'>
What his Majesty King Louis XIV. was at the Age of
Twenty-Two.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>I</span>t has been
seen, by the account we have endeavored to give of it, that the
<i>entr&eacute;e</i> of King Louis XIV. into the city of Blois
had been noisy and brilliant; his young majesty had therefore
appeared perfectly satisfied with it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                On arriving beneath the
porch of the Castle of the States, the king met, surrounded by
his guards and gentlemen, with S. A. R. the duke, Gaston of
Orl&eacute;ans, whose physiognomy, naturally rather majestic, had
borrowed on this solemn occasion a fresh luster and a fresh
dignity.  On her part, Madame, dressed in her robes of ceremony,
awaited, in the interior balcony, the entrance of her nephew. 
All the windows of the old castle, so deserted and dismal on
ordinary days, were resplendent with ladies and lights.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                It was then to the sound of
drums, trumpets, and <i>vivats</i>, that the young king crossed
the threshold of that castle in which, seventy-two years before,
Henry III. had called in the aid of assassination and treachery
to keep upon his head and in his house a crown which was already
slipping from his brow, to fall into another family.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                All eyes, after having
admired the young king, so handsome and so agreeable, sought for
that other king of France, much otherwise king than the former,
and so old, so pale, so bent, that people called the Cardinal
Mazarin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis was at this time
endowed with all the natural gifts which make the perfect
gentleman; his eye was brilliant, mild, and of a clear azure
blue.  But the most skillful physiognomists, those divers into
the soul, on fixing their looks upon it, if it had been possible
for a subject to sustain the glance of the king, - the most
skillful physiognomists, we say, would never have been able to
fathom the depths of that abyss of mildness.  It was with the
eyes of the king as with the immense depths of the azure heavens,
or with those more terrific, and almost as sublime, which the
Mediterranean reveals under the keels of its ships in a clear
summer day, a gigantic mirror in which heaven delights to reflect
sometimes its stars, sometimes its storms.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king was short of
stature - he was scarcely five feet two inches: but his youth
made up for this defect, set off likewise by great nobleness in
all his movements, and by considerable address in all bodily
exercises.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Certes, he was already quite
a king, and it was a great thing to be a king in that period of
traditional devotedness and respect; but as, up to that time, he
had been but seldom and always poorly shown to the people, as
they to whom he was shown saw him by the side of his mother, a
tall woman, and monsieur le cardinal, a man of commanding
presence, many found him so little of a king as to say, -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, the king is not so
tall as monsieur le cardinal!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Whatever may be thought of
these physical observations, which were principally made in the
capital, the young king was welcomed as a god by the inhabitants
of Blois, and almost like a king by his uncle and aunt, Monsieur
and Madame, the inhabitants of the castle.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                It must, however, be
allowed, that when he saw, in the hall of reception, chairs of
equal height for himself, his mother, the cardinal, and his uncle
and aunt, a disposition artfully concealed by the semi-circular
form of the assembly, Louis XIV. became red with anger, and
looked around him to ascertain by the countenances of those that
were present, if this humiliation had been prepared for him.  But
as he saw nothing upon the impassible visage of the cardinal,
nothing on that of his mother, nothing on those of the assembly,
he resigned himself, and sat down, taking care to be seated
before anybody else.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The gentlemen and ladies
were presented to their majesties and monsieur le cardinal.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king remarked that his
mother and he scarcely knew the names of any of the persons who
were presented to them; whilst the cardinal, on the contrary,
never failed, with an admirable memory and presence of mind, to
talk to every one about his estates, his ancestors, or his
children, some of whom he named, which enchanted those worthy
country gentlemen, and confirmed them in the idea that he alone
is truly king who knows his subjects, from the same reason that
the sun has no rival, because the sun alone warms and
lightens.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The study of the young king,
which had begun a long time before, without anybody suspecting
it, was continued then, and he looked around him attentively to
endeavor to make out something in the physiognomies which had at
first appeared the most insignificant and trivial.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                A collation was served.  The
king, without daring to call upon the hospitality of his uncle,
had waited for it impatiently.  This time, therefore, he had all
the honors due, if not to his rank, at least to his appetite.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                As to the cardinal, he
contented himself with touching with his withered lips a
<i>bouillon</i>, served in a golden cup.  The all-powerful
minister, who had taken her regency from the queen, and his
royalty from the king, had not been able to take a good stomach
from nature.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Anne of Austria, already
suffering from the cancer which six or eight years after caused
her death, ate very little more than the cardinal.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                For Monsieur, already puffed
up with the great event which had taken place in his provincial
life, he ate nothing whatever.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Madame alone, like a true
Lorrainer, kept pace with his majesty; so that Louis XIV., who,
without this partner, might have eaten nearly alone, was at first
much pleased with his aunt, and afterwards with M. de
Saint-R&eacute;my, her <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>, who had
really distinguished himself.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The collation over, at a
sign of approbation from M. de Mazarin, the king arose, and, at
the invitation of his aunt, walked about among the ranks of the
assembly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The ladies then observed -
there are certain things for which women are as good observers at
Blois as at Paris -  the ladies then observed that Louis XIV. had
a prompt and bold look, which premised a distinguished
appreciator of beauty.  The men, on their part, observed that the
prince was proud and haughty, that he loved to look down those
who fixed their eyes upon him too long or too earnestly, which
gave presage of a master.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis XIV. had accomplished
about a third of his review when his ears were struck with a word
which his eminence pronounced whilst conversing with
Monsieur.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This word was the name of a
woman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Scarcely had Louis XIV.
heard this word than he heard, or rather listening to nothing
else; and neglecting the arc of the circle which awaited his
visit, his object seemed to be to come as quickly as possible to
the extremity of the curve.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monsieur, like a good
courtier, was inquiring of monsieur le cardinal after the health
of his nieces; he regretted, he said, not having the pleasure of
receiving them at the same time with their uncle; they must
certainly have grown in stature, beauty and grace, as they had
promised to do the last time Monsieur had seen them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                What had first struck the
king was a certain constraint in the voices of the two
interlocutors.  The voice of Monsieur was calm and natural when
he spoke thus; while that of M. de Mazarin jumped by a note and a
half to reply above the diapason of his usual voice.  It might
have been said that he wished that voice to strike, at the end of
the <i>salon</i>, any ear that was too distant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monseigneur," replied he,
"Mesdemoiselles de Mazarin have still to finish their education:
they have duties to fulfill, and a position to make.  An abode in
a young and brilliant court would dissipate them a little."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis, at this last
sentence, smiled sadly.  The court was young, it was true, but
the avarice of the cardinal had taken good care that it should
not be brilliant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You have nevertheless no
intention," replied Monsieur, "to cloister them or make them
<i>borgeoises</i>?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Not at all," replied the
cardinal, forcing his Italian pronunciation in such a manner
that, from soft and velvety as it was, it became sharp and
vibrating; "not at all: I have a full and fixed intention to
marry them, and that as well as I shall be able."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Parties will not be
wanting, monsieur le cardinal," replied Monsieur, with a
<i>bonhomie</i> worthy of one tradesman congratulating
another.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I hope not, monseigneur,
and with reason, as God has been pleased to give them grace,
intelligence, and beauty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                During this conversation,
Louis XIV., conducted by Madame, accomplished, as we have
described, the circle of presentations.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Mademoiselle Auricule,"
said the princess, presenting to his majesty a fat, fair girl of
two-and-twenty, who at a village <i>f&ecirc;te</i> might have
been taken for a peasant in Sunday finery, - "the daughter of my
music-mistress."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king smiled.  Madame had
never been able to extract four correct notes from either viol or
harpsichord.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Mademoiselle Aure de
Montalais," continued Madame; "a young lady of rank, and my good
attendant."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This time it was not the
king that smiled; it was the young lady presented, because, for
the first time in her life, she heard, given to her by Madame,
who generally showed no tendency to spoil her, such an honorable
qualification.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Our old acquaintance
Montalais, therefore, made his majesty a profound courtesy, the
more respectful from the necessity she was under of concealing
certain contractions of her laughing lips, which the king might
not have attributed to their real cause.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                It was just at this moment
that the king caught the word which startled him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And the name of the third?"
asked Monsieur.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Mary, monseigneur," replied
the cardinal.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                There was doubtless some
magical influence in that word, for, as we have said, the king
started in hearing it, and drew Madame towards the middle of the
circle, as if he wished to put some confidential question to her,
but, in reality, for the sake of getting nearer to the
cardinal.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Madame, my aunt," said he,
laughing, and in a suppressed voice, "my geography-master did not
teach me that Blois was at such an immense distance from
Paris."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What do you mean, nephew?"
asked Madame.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, because it would
appear that it requires several years, as regards fashion, to
travel the distance! - Look at those young ladies!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well; I know them all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Some of them are
pretty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Don't say that too loud,
monsieur my nephew; you will drive them wild."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Stop a bit, stop a bit,
dear aunt!" said the king, smiling; "for the second part of my
sentence will serve as a corrective to the first.  Well, my dear
aunt, some of them appear old and others ugly, thanks to their
ten-year-old fashions."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But, sire, Blois is only
five days' journey from Paris."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, that is it," said the
king: "two years behind for each day."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Indeed! do you really think
so?  Well, that is strange!  It never struck me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Now, look, aunt," said
Louis XIV., drawing still nearer to Mazarin, under the pretext of
gaining a better point of view, "look at that simple white dress
by the side of those antiquated specimens of finery, and those
pretentious coiffures.  She is probably one of my mother's maids
of honor, though I don't know her."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! ah! my dear nephew!"
replied Madame, laughing; "permit me to tell you that your
divinatory science is at fault for once.  The young lady you
honor with your praise is not a Parisian, but a Blaisoise."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, aunt!" replied the king
with a look of doubt.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Come here, Louise," said
Madame.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                And the fair girl, already
known to you under that name, approached them, timid, blushing,
and almost bent beneath the royal glance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Mademoiselle Louise
Fran&ccedil;oise de la Beaume le Blanc, the daughter of the
Marquise de la Valli&egrave;re," said Madame, ceremoniously.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The young girl bowed with so
much grace, mingled with the profound timidity inspired by the
presence of the king, that the latter lost, while looking at her,
a few words of the conversation of Monsieur and the cardinal.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Daughter-in-law," continued
Madame, "of M. de Saint-R&eacute;my, my <i>ma&icirc;tre
d'h&ocirc;tel</i>, who presided over the confection of that
excellent <i>daube truff&eacute;e</i> which your majesty seemed
so much to appreciate."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                No grace, no youth, no
beauty, could stand out against such a presentation.  The king
smiled.  Whether the words of Madame were a pleasantry, or
uttered in all innocency, they proved the pitiless immolation of
everything that Louis had found charming or poetic in the young
girl.  Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re, for Madame and, by
rebound, for the king, was, for a moment, no more than the
daughter of a man of a superior talent over <i>dindes
truff&eacute;es</i>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                But princes are thus
constituted.  The gods, too, were just like this in Olympus. 
Diana and Venus, no doubt, abused the beautiful Alcmena and poor
Io, when they condescended for distraction's sake, to speak,
amidst nectar and ambrosia, of mortal beauties, at the table of
Jupiter.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Fortunately, Louise was so
bent in her reverential salute, that she did not catch either
Madame's words or the king's smile.  In fact, if the poor child,
who had so much good taste as alone to have chosen to dress
herself in white amidst all her companions - if that dove's
heart, so easily accessible to painful emotions, had been touched
by the cruel words of Madame, or the egotistical cold smile of
the king, it would have annihilated her.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                And Montalais herself, the
girl of ingenious ideas, would not have attempted to recall her
to life; for ridicule kills beauty even.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                But fortunately, as we have
said, Louise, whose ears were buzzing, and her eyes veiled by
timidity, - Louise saw nothing and heard nothing; and the king,
who had still his attention directed to the conversation of the
cardinal and his uncle, hastened to return to them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                He came up just at the
moment Mazarin terminated by saying: "Mary, as well as her
sisters, has just set off for Brouage.  I make them follow the
opposite bank of the Loire to that along which we have traveled;
and if I calculate their progress correctly, according to the
orders I have given, they will to-morrow be opposite Blois."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                These words were pronounced
with that tact - that measure, that distinctness of tone, of
intention, and reach - which made <i>del Signor Giulio
Mazarini</i> the first comedian in the world.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                It resulted that they went
straight to the heart of Louis XIV., and the cardinal, on turning
round at the simple noise of the approaching footsteps of his
majesty, saw the immediate effect of them upon the countenance of
his pupil, an effect betrayed to the keen eyes of his eminence by
a slight increase of color.  But what was the ventilation of such
a secret to him whose craft had for twenty years deceived all the
diplomatists of Europe?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                From the moment the young
king heard these last words, he appeared as if he had received a
poisoned arrow in his heart.  He could not remain quiet in a
place, but cast around an uncertain, dead, and aimless look over
the assembly.  He with his eyes interrogated his mother more than
twenty times: but she, given up to the pleasure of conversing
with her sister-in-law, and likewise constrained by the glance of
Mazarin, did not appear to comprehend any of the supplications
conveyed by the looks of her son.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                From this moment, music,
lights, flowers, beauties, all became odious and insipid to Louis
XIV.  After he had a hundred times bitten his lips, stretched his
legs and his arms like a well-brought-up child, who, without
daring to gape, exhausts all the modes of evincing his weariness
- after having uselessly again implored his mother and the
minister, he turned a despairing look towards the door, that is
to say, towards liberty.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                At this door, in the
embrasure of which he was leaning, he saw, standing out strongly,
a figure with a brown and lofty countenance, an aquiline nose, a
stern but brilliant eye, gray and long hair, a black mustache,
the true type of military beauty, whose gorget, more sparkling
than a mirror, broke all the reflected lights which concentrated
upon it, and sent them back as lightning.  This officer wore his
gray hat with its long red plumes upon his head, a proof that he
was called there by his duty, and not by his pleasure.  If he had
been brought thither by his pleasure - if he had been a courtier
instead of a soldier, as pleasure must always be paid for at the
same price - he would have held his hat in his hand.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                That which proved still
better that this officer was upon duty, and was accomplishing a
task to which he was accustomed, was, that he watched, with
folded arms, remarkable indifference, and supreme apathy, the
joys and <i>ennuis</i> of this <i>f&ecirc;te</i>.  Above all, he
appeared, like a philosopher, and all old soldiers are
philosophers, - he appeared above all to comprehend
the<i>ennuis</i> infinitely better than the joys; but in the one
he took his part, knowing very well how to do without the
other.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Now, he was leaning, as we
have said, against the carved door-frame when the melancholy,
weary eyes of the king, by chance, met his.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                It was not the first time,
as it appeared, that the eyes of the officer had met those eyes,
and he was perfectly acquainted with the expression of them; for,
as soon as he had cast his own look upon the countenance of Louis
XIV., and had read by it what was passing in his heart - that is
to say, all the <i>ennui</i> that oppressed him - all the timid
desire to go out which agitated him, - he perceived he must
render the king a service without his commanding it, - almost in
spite of himself.  Boldly, therefore, as if he had given the word
of command to cavalry in battle, "On the king's service!" cried
he, in a clear, sonorous voice.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                At these words, which
produced the effect of a peal of thunder, prevailing over the
orchestra, the singing and the buzz of the promenaders, the
cardinal and the queen-mother looked at each other with
surprise.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis XIV., pale, but
resolved, supported as he was by that intuition of his own
thought which he had found in the mind of the officer of
musketeers, and which he had just manifested by the order given,
arose from his chair, and took a step towards the door.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Are you going, my son?"
said the queen, whilst Mazarin satisfied himself with
interrogating by a look which might have appeared mild if it had
not been so piercing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, madame," replied the
king; "I am fatigued, and, besides, wish to write this
evening."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                A smile stole over the lips
of the minister, who appeared, by a bend of the head, to give the
king permission.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monsieur and Madame hastened
to give orders to the officers who presented themselves.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king bowed, crossed the
hall, and gained the door, where a hedge of twenty musketeers
awaited him.  At the extremity of this hedge stood the officer,
impassible, with his drawn sword in his hand.  The king passed,
and all the crowd stood on tip-toe, to have one more look at
him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Ten musketeers, opening the
crowd of the ante-chambers and the steps, made way for his
majesty.  The other ten surrounded the king and Monsieur, who had
insisted upon accompanying his majesty.  The domestics walked
behind.  This little <i>cort&eacute;ge</i> escorted the king to
the chamber destined for him.  The apartment was the same that
had been occupied by Henry III. during his sojourn in the
States.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monsieur had given his
orders.  The musketeers, led by their officer, took possession of
the little passage by which one wing of the castle communicates
with the other.  This passage was commenced by a small square
ante-chamber, dark even in the finest days.  Monsieur stopped
Louis XIV.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are passing now, sire,"
said he, "the very spot where the Duc de Guise received the first
stab of the poniard."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king was ignorant of all
historical matters; he had heard of the fact, but he knew nothing
of the localities or the details.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah!" said he with a
shudder.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                And he stopped.  The rest,
both behind and before him, stopped likewise.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The duc, sire," continued
Gaston, "was nearly were I stand: he was walking in the same
direction as your majesty; M. de Loignac was exactly where your
lieutenant of musketeers is; M. de Saint-Maline and his majesty's
ordinaries were behind him and around him.  It was here that he
was struck."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king turned towards his
officer, and saw something like a cloud pass over his martial and
daring countenance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, from behind!" murmured
the lieutenant, with a gesture of supreme disdain.  And he
endeavored to resume the march, as if ill at ease at being
between walls formerly defiled by treachery.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                But the king, who appeared
to wish to be informed, was disposed to give another look at this
dismal spot.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Gaston perceived his
nephew's desire.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Look, sire," said he,
taking a flambeaux from the hands of M. de Saint-R&eacute;my,
"this is where he fell.  There was a bed there, the curtains of
which he tore with catching at them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why does the floor seem
hollowed out at this spot?" asked Louis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Because it was here the
blood flowed," replied Gaston; "the blood penetrated deeply into
the oak, and it was only by cutting it out that they succeeded in
making it disappear.  And even then," added Gaston, pointing the
flambeaux to the spot, "even then this red stain resisted all the
attempts made to destroy it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis XIV. raised his head. 
Perhaps he was thinking of that bloody trace that had once been
shown him at the Louvre, and which, as a pendant to that of
Blois, had been made there one day by the king his father with
the blood of Concini.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Let us go on," said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The march was resumed
promptly; for emotion, no doubt, had given to the voice of the
young prince a tone of command which was not customary with him. 
When he arrived at the apartment destined for the king, which
communicated not only with the little passage we have passed
through, but further with the great staircase leading to the
court, -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Will your majesty," said
Gaston, "condescend to occupy this apartment, all unworthy as it
is to receive you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Uncle," replied the young
king, "I render you my thanks for your cordial hospitality."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Gaston bowed to his nephew,
embraced him, and then went out.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Of the twenty musketeers who
had accompanied the king, ten reconducted Monsieur to the
reception-rooms, which were not yet empty, notwithstanding the
king had retired.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The ten others were posted
by their officer, who himself explored, in five minutes, all the
localities, with that cold and certain glance which not even
habit gives unless that glance belongs to genius.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Then, when all were placed,
he chose as his headquarters the ante-chamber, in which he found
a large <i>fauteuil</i>, a lamp, some wine, some water, and some
dry bread.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                He refreshed his lamp, drank
half a glass of wine, curled his lip with a smile full of
expression, installed himself in his large armchair, and made
preparations for sleeping.</p>

who was sleeping, or preparing to sleep, was, notwithstanding his
careless air, charged with a serious responsibility.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Lieutenant of the king's
musketeers, he commanded all the company which came from Paris,
and that company consisted of a hundred and twenty men; but, with
the exception of the twenty of whom we have spoken, the other
hundred were engaged in guarding the queen-mother, and more
particularly the cardinal.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monsignor Giulio Mazarini
economized the traveling expenses of his guards; he consequently
used the king's, and that largely, since he took fifty of them
for himself - a peculiarity which would not have failed to strike
any one unacquainted with the usages of that court.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                That which would still
further have appeared, if not inconvenient, at least
extraordinary, to a stranger, was, that the side of the castle
destined for monsieur le cardinal was brilliant, light and
cheerful.  The musketeers there mounted guard before every door,
and allowed no one to enter, except the couriers, who, even while
he was traveling, followed the cardinal for the carrying on of
his correspondence.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Twenty men were on duty with
the queen-mother; thirty rested, in order to relieve their
companions the next day.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                On the king's side, on the
contrary, were darkness, silence, and solitude.  When once the
doors were closed, there was no longer an appearance of royalty. 
All the servitors had by degrees retired.  Monsieur le Prince had
sent to know if his majesty required his attendance; and on the
customary "<i>No</i>" of the lieutenant of musketeers, who was
habituated to the question and the reply, all appeared to sink
into the arms of sleep, as if in the dwelling of a good
citizen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                And yet it was possible to
hear from the side of the house occupied by the young king the
music of the banquet, and to see the windows of the great hall
richly illuminated.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Ten minutes after his
installation in his apartment, Louis XIV. had been able to learn,
by movement much more distinguished than marked his own leaving,
the departure of the cardinal, who, in his turn, sought his
bedroom, accompanied by a large escort of ladies and
gentlemen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Besides, to perceive this
movement, he had nothing to do but look out at his window, the
shutters of which had not been closed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                His eminence crossed the
court, conducted by Monsieur, who himself held a flambeau; then
followed the queen-mother, to whom Madame familiarly gave her
arm; and both walked chatting away, like two old friends.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Behind these two couples
filed nobles, ladies, pages and officers; the flambeaux gleamed
over the whole court, like the moving reflections of a
conflagration.  Then the noise of steps and voices became lost in
the upper floors of the castle.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                No one was then thinking of
the king, who, leaning on his elbow at his window, had sadly seen
pass away all that light, and heard that noise die off - no, not
one, if it was not that unknown of the hostelry <i>des
Medici</i>, whom we have seen go out, enveloped in his cloak.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                He had come straight up to
the castle, and had, with his melancholy countenance, wandered
round and round the palace, from which the people had not yet
departed; and finding that on one guarded the great entrance, or
the porch, seeing that the soldiers of Monsieur were fraternizing
with the royal soldiers - that is to say, swallowing Beaugency at
discretion, or rather indiscretion - the unknown penetrated
through the crowd, then ascended to the court, and came to the
landing of the staircase leading to the cardinal's apartment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                What, according to all
probability, induced him to direct his steps that way, was the
splendor of the flambeaux, and the busy air of the pages and
domestics.  But he was stopped short by a presented musket and
the cry of the sentinel.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Where are you going, my
friend?" asked the soldier.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am going to the king's
apartment," replied the unknown, haughtily, but tranquilly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The soldier called one of
his eminence's officers, who, in the tone in which a youth in
office directs a solicitor to a minister, let fall these words:
"The other staircase, in front."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                And the officer, without
further notice of the unknown, resumed his interrupted
conversation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The stranger, without reply,
directed his steps towards the staircase pointed out to him.  On
this side there was no noise, there were no more flambeaux.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Obscurity, through which a
sentinel glided like a shadow; silence, which permitted him to
hear the sound of his own footsteps, accompanied with the
jingling of his spurs upon the stone slabs.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This guard was one of the
twenty musketeers appointed for attendance upon the king, and who
mounted guard with the stiffness and consciousness of a
statue.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who goes there?" said the
guard.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A friend," replied the
unknown.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What do you want?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To speak to the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do you, my dear monsieur? 
That's not very likely."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Because the king has gone
to bed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Gone to bed already?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No matter: I must speak to
him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And I tell you that is
impossible."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And yet - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Go back!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do you require the
word?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have no account to render
to you.  Stand back!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                And this time the soldier
accompanied his word with a threatening gesture; but the unknown
stirred no more than if his feet had taken root.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur le mousquetaire,"
said he, "are you a gentleman?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have that honor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very well!  I also am one;
and between gentlemen some consideration ought to be
observed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The soldier lowered his
arms, overcome by the dignity with which these words were
pronounced.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Speak, monsieur," said he;
"and if you ask me anything in my power - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thank you.  You have an
officer, have you not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Our lieutenant?  Yes,
monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, I wish to speak to
him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, that's a different
thing.  Come up, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The unknown saluted the
soldier in a lofty fashion, and ascended the staircase; whilst a
cry, "Lieutenant, a visit!" transmitted from sentinel to
sentinel, preceded the unknown, and disturbed the slumbers of the
officer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Dragging on his boot,
rubbing his eyes, and hooking his cloak, the lieutenant made
three steps towards the stranger.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What can I do to serve you,
monsieur?" asked he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are the officer on
duty, lieutenant of the musketeers, are you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have that honor," replied
the officer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, I must absolutely
speak to the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The lieutenant looked
attentively at the unknown, and in that look, he saw all he
wished to see - that is to say, a person of high distinction in
an ordinary dress.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I do not suppose you to be
mad," replied he; "and yet you seem to me to be in a condition to
know, monsieur, that people do not enter a king's apartments in
this manner without his consent."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He will consent."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, permit me to
doubt that.  The king has retired this quarter of an hour; he
must be now undressing.  Besides, the word is given."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "When he knows who I am, he
will recall the word."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The officer was more and
more surprised, more and more subdued.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "If I consent to announce
you, may I at least know whom to announce, monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You will announce His
Majesty Charles II., King of England, Scotland, and Ireland."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The officer uttered a cry of
astonishment, drew back, and there might be seen upon his pallid
countenance one of the most poignant emotions that ever an
energetic man endeavored to drive back to his heart.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, yes, sire; in fact,"
said he, "I ought to have recognized you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You have seen my portrait,
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Or else you have seen me
formerly at court, before I was driven from France?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, sire, it is not even
that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How then could you have
recognized me, if you have never seen my portrait or my
person?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, I saw his majesty
your father at a terrible moment."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The day - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                A dark cloud passed over the
brow of the prince; then, dashing his hand across it, "Do you see
any difficulty in announcing me?" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, pardon me," replied
the officer, "but I could not imagine a king under so simple an
exterior; and yet I had the honor to tell your majesty just now
that I had seen Charles I.  But pardon me, monsieur; I will go
and inform the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                But returning after going a
few steps, "Your majesty is desirous, without doubt, that this
interview should be a secret?" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I do not require it; but if
it were possible to preserve it - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is possible, sire, for I
can dispense with informing the first gentleman on duty; but, for
that, your majesty must please to consent to give up your
sword."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "True, true; I had forgotten
that no one armed is permitted to enter the chamber of a king of
France."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your majesty will form an
exception, if you wish it; but then I shall avoid my
responsibility by informing the king's attendant."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Here is my sword,
monsieur.  Will you now please to announce me to his
majesty?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Instantly, sire."  And the
officer immediately went and knocked at the door of
communication, which the valet opened to him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "His Majesty the King of
England!" said the officer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "His Majesty the King of
England!" replied the <i>valet de chambre</i>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                At these words a gentleman
opened the folding-doors of the king's apartment, and Louis XIV.
was seen, without hat or sword, and his <i>pourpoint</i> open,
advancing with signs of the greatest surprise.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You, my brother - you at
Blois!" cried Louis XIV., dismissing with a gesture both the
gentlemen and the <i>valet de chambre</i>, who passed out into
the next apartment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire," replied Charles II.,
"I was going to Paris, in the hope of seeing your majesty, when
report informed me of your approaching arrival in this city.  I
therefore prolonged my abode here, having something very
particular to communicate to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Will this closet suit you,
my brother?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Perfectly well, sire; for I
think no one can hear us here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have dismissed my
gentleman and my watcher; they are in the next chamber.  There,
behind that partition, is a solitary closet, looking into the
ante-chamber, and in that ante-chamber you found nobody but a
solitary officer, did you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, then, speak, my
brother; I listen to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, I commence, and
entreat your majesty to have pity on the misfortunes of our
house."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king of France colored,
and drew his chair closer to that of the king of England.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire," said Charles II., "I
have no need to ask if your majesty is acquainted with the
details of my deplorable history."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis XIV. blushed, this
time more strongly than before; then, stretching forth his hand
to that of the king of England, "My brother," said he, "I am
ashamed to say so, but the cardinal scarcely ever speaks of
political affairs before me.  Still more, formerly I used to get
Laporte, my <i>valet de chambre</i>, to read historical subjects
to me; but he put a stop to these readings, and took away Laporte
from me.  So that I beg my brother Charles to tell me all those
matters as to a man who knows nothing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, sire, I think that by
taking things from the beginning I shall have a better chance of
touching the heart of your majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Speak on, my brother -
speak on."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You know, sire, that being
called in 1650 to Edinburgh, during Cromwell's expedition into
Ireland, I was crowned at Scone.  A year after, wounded in one of
the provinces he had usurped, Cromwell returned upon us.  To meet
him was my object; to leave Scotland was my wish."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And yet," interrupted the
young king, "Scotland is almost your native country, is it not,
my brother?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, but the Scots were
cruel compatriots for me, sire; they had forced me to forsake the
religion of my fathers; they had hung Lord Montrose, the most
devoted of my servants, because he was not a Covenanter; and as
the poor martyr, to whom they had offered a favor when dying, had
asked that his body might be cut into as many pieces as there are
cities in Scotland, in order that evidence of his fidelity might
be met with everywhere, I could not leave one city, or go into
another, without passing under some fragments of a body which had
acted, fought, and breathed for me.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "By a bold, almost desperate
march, I passed through Cromwell's army, and entered England. 
The Protector set out in pursuit of this strange flight, which
had a crown for its object.  If I had been able to reach London
before him, without doubt the prize of the race would have been
mine; but he overtook me at Worcester.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The genius of England was
no longer with us, but with him.  On the 3rd of September, 1651,
sire, the anniversary of the other battle of Dunbar, so fatal to
the Scots, I was conquered.  Two thousand men fell around me
before I thought of retreating a step.  At length I was obliged
to fly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "From that moment my history
became a romance.  Pursued with persistent inveteracy, I cut off
my hair, I disguised myself as a woodman.  One day spent amidst
the branches of an oak gave to that tree the name of the royal
oak, which it bears to this day.  My adventures in the county of
Stafford, whence I escaped with the daughter of my host on a
pillion behind me, still fill the tales of the country firesides,
and would furnish matter for ballads.  I will some day write all
this, sire, for the instruction of my brother kings.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I will first tell how, on
arriving at the residence of Mr. Norton, I met with a court
chaplain, who was looking on at a party playing at skittles, and
an old servant who named me, bursting into tears, and who was as
near and as certainly killing me by his fidelity as another might
have been by treachery.  Then I will tell of my terrors - yes,
sire, of my terrors - when, at the house of Colonel Windham, a
farrier who came to shoe our horses declared they had been shod
in the north."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How strange!" murmured
Louis XIV.  "I never heard anything of all that; I was only told
of your embarkation at Brighelmsted and your landing in
Normandy." <b><sup>1</sup></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!" exclaimed Charles, "if
Heaven permits kings to be thus ignorant of the histories of each
other, how can they render assistance to their brothers who need
it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But tell me," continued
Louis XIV., "how, after being so roughly received in England, you
can still hope for anything from that unhappy country and that
rebellious people?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, sire! since the battle
of Worcester, everything is changed there.  Cromwell is dead,
after having signed a treaty with France, in which his name is
placed above yours.  He died on the 3rd of September, 1658, a
fresh anniversary of the battles of Dunbar and Worcester."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "His son has succeeded
him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But certain men have a
family, sire, and no heir.  The inheritance of Oliver was too
heavy for Richard.  Richard was neither a republican nor a
royalist; Richard allowed his guards to eat his dinner, and his
generals to govern the republic; Richard abdicated the
protectorate on the 22nd of April, 1659, more than a year ago,
sire.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "From that time England is
nothing but a tennis-court, in which the players throw dice for
the crown of my father.  The two most eager players are Lambert
and Monk.  Well, sire, I, in my turn, wish to take part in this
game, where the stakes are thrown upon my royal mantle.  Sire, it
only requires a million to corrupt one of these players and make
an ally of him, or two hundred of your gentlemen to drive them
out of my palace at Whitehall, as Christ drove the money-changers
from the temple."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You come, then," replied
Louis XIV., to ask me - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "For your assistance; that
is to say, not only for that which kings owe to each other, but
that which simple Christians owe to each other - your assistance,
sire, either in money or men.  Your assistance, sire, and within
a month, whether I oppose Lambert to Monk, or Monk to Lambert, I
shall have reconquered my paternal inheritance, without having
cost my country a guinea, or my subjects a drop of blood, for
they are now all drunk with revolutions, protectorates, and
republics, and ask nothing better than to fall staggering to
sleep in the arms of royalty.  Your assistance, sire, and I shall
owe you more than I owe my father, - my poor father, who bought
at so dear a rate the ruin of our house!  You may judge, sire,
whether I am unhappy, whether I am in despair, for I accuse my
own father!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                And the blood mounted to the
pale face of Charles II., who remained for an instant with his
head between his hands, and as if blinded by that blood which
appeared to revolt against the filial blasphemy.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The young king was not less
affected than his elder brother; he threw himself about in his
<i>fauteuil</i>, and could not find a single word of reply.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Charles II., to whom ten
years in age gave a superior strength to master his emotions,
recovered his speech the first.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire," said he, "your
reply?  I wait for it as a criminal waits for his sentence.  Must
I die?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My brother," replied the
French prince, "you ask of me for a million - me, who was never
possessed of a quarter of that sum!  I possess nothing.  I am no
more king of France than you are king of England.  I am a name, a
cipher dressed in <i>fleur-de-lised</i> velvet, - that is all.  I
am upon a visible throne; that is my only advantage over your
majesty.  I have nothing - I can do nothing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Can it be so?" exclaimed
Charles II.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My brother," said Louis,
sinking his voice, "I have undergone miseries with which my
poorest gentlemen are unacquainted.  If my poor Laporte were
here, he would tell you that I have slept in ragged sheets,
through the holes of which my legs have passed; he would tell you
that afterwards, when I asked for carriages, they brought me
conveyances half-destroyed by the rats of the coach-houses; he
would tell you that when I asked for my dinner, the servants went
to the cardinal's kitchen to inquire if there were any dinner for
the king.  And look! to-day, this very day even, when I am
twenty-two years of age, - to-day, when I have attained the grade
of the majority of kings, - to-day, when I ought to have the key
of the treasury, the direction of the policy, the supremacy in
peace and war, - cast your eyes around me, see how I am left! 
Look at this abandonment - this disdain - this silence! - Whilst
yonder - look yonder!  View the bustle, the lights, the homage! 
There! - there you see the real king of France, my brother!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In the cardinal's
apartments?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, in the cardinal's
apartments."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then I am condemned,
sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis XIV. made no
reply.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Condemned is the word; for
I will never solicit him who left my mother and sister to die
with cold and hunger - the daughter and grand-daughter of Henry
IV. - as surely they would have if M. de Retz and the parliament
had not sent them wood and bread."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To die?" murmured Louis
XIV.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well!" continued the king
of England, "poor Charles II., grandson of Henry IV., as you are,
sire having neither parliament nor Cardinal de Retz to apply to,
will die of hunger, as his mother and sister had nearly
done."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis knitted his brow, and
twisted violently the lace of his ruffles.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This prostration, this
immobility, serving as a mark to an emotion so visible, struck
Charles II., and he took the young man's hand.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thanks!" said he, "my
brother.  You pity me, and that is all I can require of you in
your present situation."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire," said Louis XIV.,
with a sudden impulse, and raising his head, "it is a million you
require, or two hundred gentlemen, I think you say?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, a million would be
quite sufficient."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is very little."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Offered to a single man it
is a great deal.  Convictions have been purchased at a much lower
price; and I should have nothing to do but with venalities."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Two hundred gentlemen! 
Reflect! - that is little more than a single company."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, there is in our
family a tradition, and that is, that four men, four French
gentlemen, devoted to my father, were near saving my father,
though condemned by a parliament, guarded by an army and
surrounded by a nation."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then if I can procure you a
million, or two hundred gentlemen, you will be satisfied; and you
will consider me your well-affectioned brother?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I shall consider you as my
saviour; and if I recover the throne of my father, England will
be, as long as I reign it, a sister to France, as you will have
been a brother to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, my brother," said
Louis, rising, "what you hesitate to ask for, I will myself
demand; that which I have never done on my own account, I will do
on yours.  I will go and find the king of France - the other -
the rich, the powerful one, I mean.  I will myself solicit this
million, or these two hundred gentlemen; and - we will see."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!" cried Charles; "you
are a noble friend, sire - a heart created by God!  You save me,
my brother; and if you should ever stand in need of the life you
restored me, demand it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Silence, my brother, -
silence!" said Louis, in a suppressed voice.  "Take care that no
one hears you!  We have not obtained our end yet.  To ask money
of Mazarin - that is worse than traversing the enchanted forest,
each tree of which inclosed a demon.  It is more than setting out
to conquer a world."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But yet, sire, when you ask
it - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have already told you
that I never asked," replied Louis with a haughtiness that made
the king of England turn pale.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                And the latter, like a
wounded man, made a retreating movement - "Pardon me, my
brother," replied he.  "I have neither a mother nor a sister who
are suffering.  My throne is hard and naked, but I am firmly
seated on my throne.  Pardon me that expression, my brother; it
was that of an egotist.  I will retract it, therefore, by a
sacrifice, - I will go to monsieur le cardinal.  Wait for me, if
you please - I will return."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>W</span>hilst the
king was directing his course rapidly towards the wing of the
castle occupied by the cardinal, taking nobody with him but his
<i>valet de chambre</i>, the officer of musketeers came out,
breathing like a man who has for a long time been forced to hold
his breath, from the little cabinet of which we have already
spoken, and which the king believed to be quite solitary.  This
little cabinet had formerly been part of the chamber, from which
it was only separated by a thin partition.  It resulted that this
partition, which was only for the eye, permitted the ear the
least indiscreet to hear every word spoken in the chamber.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                There was no doubt, then,
that this lieutenant of musketeers had heard all that passed in
his majesty's apartment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Warned by the last words of
the young king, he came out just in time to salute him on his
passage, and to follow him with his eyes till he had disappeared
in the corridor.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Then as soon as he had
disappeared, he shook his head after a fashion peculiarly his
own, and in a voice which forty years' absence from Gascony had
not deprived of its Gascon accent, "A melancholy service," said
he, "and a melancholy master!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                These words pronounced, the
lieutenant resumed his place in his <i>fauteuil</i>, stretched
his legs and closed his eyes, like a man who either sleeps or
meditates.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                During this short monologue
and the <i>mise en sc&egrave;ne</i> that had accompanied it,
whilst the king, through the long corridors of the old castle,
proceeded to the apartment of M. de Mazarin, a scene of another
sort was being enacted in those apartments.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Mazarin was in bed,
suffering a little from the gout.  But as he was a man of order,
who utilized even pain, he forced his wakefulness to be the
humble servant of his labor.  He had consequently ordered
Bernouin, his <i>valet de chambre</i>, to bring him a little
traveling-desk, so that he might write in bed.  But the gout is
not an adversary that allows itself to be conquered so easily;
therefore, at each movement he made, the pain from dull became
sharp.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is Brienne there?" asked he
of Bernouin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, monseigneur," replied
the <i>valet de chambre</i>; "M. de Brienne, with your
permission, is gone to bed.  But if it is the wish of your
eminence, he can speedily be called."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, it is not worth while. 
Let us see, however.  Cursed ciphers!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                And the cardinal began to
think, counting on his fingers the while.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, ciphers is it?" said
Bernouin.  "Very well! if your eminence attempts calculations, I
will promise you a pretty headache to-morrow!  And with that
please to remember M. Gu&eacute;naud is not here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are right, Bernouin. 
You must take Brienne's place, my friend.  Indeed, I ought to
have brought M. Colbert with me.  That young man goes on very
well, Bernouin, very well; a very orderly youth."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I do not know," sad the
<i>valet de chambre</i>, "but I don't like the countenance of
your young man who goes on so well."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, well, Bernouin!  We
don't stand in need of your advice.  Place yourself there: take
the pen and write."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am ready, monseigneur;
what am I to write?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "There, that's the place:
after the two lines already traced."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am there."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Write seven hundred and
sixty thousand livres."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is written."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Upon Lyons - "  The
cardinal appeared to hesitate.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Upon Lyons," repeated
Bernouin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Three millions nine hundred
thousand livres."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, monseigneur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Upon Bordeaux, seven
millions."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Seven?" repeated
Bernouin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes," said the cardinal,
pettishly, "seven."  Then, recollecting himself, "You understand,
Bernouin," added he, "that all this money is to be spent?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eh! monseigneur; whether it
be spent or put away is of very little consequence to me, since
none of these millions are mine."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "These millions are the
king's; it is the king's money I am reckoning.  Well, what were
we saying?  You always interrupt me!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Seven millions upon
Bordeaux."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! yes; that's right. 
Upon Madrid four millions.  I give you to understand plainly to
whom this money belongs, Bernouin, seeing that everybody has the
stupidity to believe me rich in millions.  I repel the silly
idea.  A minister, besides, has nothing of his own.  Come, go
on.  <i>Rentr&eacute;es generales</i>, seven millions;
properties, nine millions.  Have you written that, Bernouin?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Bourse</i>, six hundred
thousand livres; various property, two millions.  Ah!  I forgot -
the furniture of the different ch&acirc;teaux - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Must I put of the crown?"
asked Bernouin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, no; it is of no use
doing that - that is understood.  Have you written that,
Bernouin?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And the ciphers?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Stand straight under one
another."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Cast them up,
Bernouin."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thirty-nine millions two
hundred and sixty thousand livres, monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah!" cried the cardinal, in
a tone of vexation; "there are not yet forty millions!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Bernouin recommenced the
addition.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, monseigneur; there want
seven hundred and forty thousand livres."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Mazarin asked for the
account, and revised it carefully.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, but," said Bernouin,
"thirty-nine millions two hundred and sixty thousand livres make
a good round sum."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, Bernouin; I wish the
king had it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your eminence told me that
this money was his majesty's."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Doubtless, as clear, as
transparent as possible.  These thirty-nine millions are
bespoken, and much more."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Bernouin smiled after his
own fashion - that is, like a man who believes no more than he is
willing to believe - whilst preparing the cardinal's night
draught, and putting his pillow to rights.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!" said Mazarin, when the
valet had gone out; "not yet forty millions!  I must, however,
attain that sum, which I had set down for myself.  But who knows
whether I shall have time?  I sink, I am going, I shall never
reach it!  And yet, who knows that I may not find two or three
millions in the pockets of my good friends the Spaniards?  They
discovered Peru, those people did, and - what the devil! they
must have something left."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                As he was speaking thus,
entirely occupied with his ciphers, and thinking no more of his
gout, repelled by a preoccupation which, with the cardinal, was
the most powerful of all preoccupations, Bernouin rushed into the
chamber, quite in a fright.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well!" asked the cardinal,
"what is the matter now?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The king, monseigneur, -
the king!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How? - the king!" said
Mazarin, quickly concealing his paper.  "The king here! the king
at this hour!  I thought he was in bed long ago.  What is the
matter, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king could hear these
last words, and see the terrified gesture of the cardinal rising
up in his bed, for he entered the chamber at that moment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is nothing, monsieur le
cardinal, or at least nothing which can alarm you.  It is an
important communication which I wish to make to your eminence
to-night, - that is all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Mazarin immediately thought
of that marked attention which the king had given to his words
concerning Mademoiselle de Mancini, and the communication
appeared to him probably to refer to this source.  He recovered
his serenity then instantly, and assumed his most agreeable air,
a change of countenance which inspired the king with the greatest
joy; and when Louis was seated, -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire," said the cardinal,
"I ought certainly to listen to your majesty standing, but the
violence of my complaint - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No ceremony between us, my
dear monsieur le cardinal," said Louis kindly: "I am your pupil,
and not the king, you know very well, and this evening in
particular, as I come to you as a petitioner, as a solicitor, and
one very humble, and desirous to be kindly received, too."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Mazarin, seeing the
heightened color of the king, was confirmed in his first idea;
that is to say, that love thoughts were hidden under all these
fine words.  This time, political cunning, as keen as it was,
made a mistake; this color was not caused by the bashfulness of a
juvenile passion, but only by the painful contraction of the
royal pride.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Like a good uncle, Mazarin
felt disposed to facilitate the confidence.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Speak, sire," said he, "and
since your majesty is willing for an instant to forget that I am
your subject, and call me your master and instructor, I promise
your majesty my most devoted and tender consideration."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thanks, monsieur le
cardinal," answered the king; "that which I have to ask of your
eminence has but little to do with myself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So much the worse!" replied
the cardinal; "so much the worse!  Sire, I should wish your
majesty to ask of me something of importance, even a sacrifice;
but whatever it may be that you ask me, I am ready to set your
heart at rest by granting it, my dear sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, this is what brings
me here," said the king, with a beating of the heart that had no
equal except the beating of the heart of the minister; "I have
just received a visit from my brother, the king of England."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Mazarin bounded in his bed
as if he had been put in relation with a Leyden jar or a voltaic
pile, at the same time that a surprise, or rather a manifest
disappointment, inflamed his features with such a blaze of anger,
that Louis XIV., little diplomatist as he was, saw that the
minister had hoped to hear something else.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Charles II.?" exclaimed
Mazarin, with a hoarse voice and a disdainful movement of his
lips.  "You have received a visit from Charles II.?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "From King Charles II.,"
replied Louis, according in a marked manner to the grandson of
Henry IV. the title which Mazarin had forgotten to give him. 
"Yes, monsieur le cardinal, that unhappy prince has touched my
heart with the relation of his misfortunes.  His distress is
great, monsieur le cardinal, and it has appeared painful to me,
who have seen my own throne disputed, who have been forced in
times of commotion to quit my capital, - to me, in short, who am
acquainted with misfortune, - to leave a deposed and fugitive
brother without assistance."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eh!" said the cardinal,
sharply; "why had he not, as you have, a Jules Mazarin by his
side?  His crown would then have remained intact."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I know all that my house
owes to your eminence," replied the king, haughtily, "and you may
well believe that I, on my part, shall never forget it.  It is
precisely because my brother, the king of England has not about
him the powerful genius who has saved me, it is for that, I say,
that I wish to conciliate the aid of that same genius, and beg
you to extend your arm over his head, well assured, monsieur le
cardinal, that your hand, by touching him only, would know how to
replace upon his brow the crown which fell at the foot of his
father's scaffold."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire," replied Mazarin, "I
thank you for your good opinion with regard to myself, but we
have nothing to do yonder: they are a set of madmen who deny God,
and cut off the heads of their kings.  They are dangerous,
observe, sire, and filthy to the touch after having wallowed in
royal blood and covenantal murder.  That policy has never suited
me, - I scorn it and reject it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Therefore you ought to
assist in establishing a better."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What is that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The restoration of Charles
II., for example."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good heavens!" cried
Mazarin, "does the poor prince flatter himself with that
chimera?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, he does," replied the
young king, terrified at the difficulties opposed to this
project, which he fancied he could perceive in the infallible eye
of his minister; "he only asks for a million to carry out his
purpose."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is that all - a little
million, if you please!" said the cardinal, ironically, with an
effort to conquer his Italian accent.  "A little million, if you
please, brother!  Bah! a family of mendicants!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Cardinal," said Louis,
raising his head, "that family of mendicants is a branch of my
family."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Are you rich enough to give
millions to other people, sire?  Have you millions to throw
away?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!" replied Louis XIV.,
with great pain, which he, however, by a strong effort, prevented
from appearing on his countenance; - "oh! yes, monsieur le
cardinal, I am well aware I am poor, and yet the crown of France
is worth a million, and to perform a good action I would pledge
my crown if it were necessary.  I could find Jews who would be
willing to lend me a million."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So, sire, you say you want
a million?" said Mazarin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur, I say
so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are mistaken, greatly
mistaken, sire; you want much more than that, - Bernouin! - you
shall see, sire, how much you really want."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What, cardinal!" said the
king, "are you going to consult a lackey about my affairs?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bernouin!" cried the
cardinal again, without appearing to remark the humiliation of
the young prince.  "Come here, Bernouin, and tell me the figures
I gave you just now."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Cardinal, cardinal! did you
not hear me?" said Louis, turning pale with anger.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do not be angry, sire; I
deal openly with the affairs of your majesty.  Every one in
France knows that; my books are as open as day.  What did I tell
you to do just now, Bernouin?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your eminence commanded me
to cast up an account."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You did it, did you
not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To verify the amount of
which his majesty, at this moment, stands in need.  Did I not
tell you so?  Be frank, my friend."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your eminence said so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, what sum did I say I
wanted?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Forty-five millions, I
think."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And what sum could we find,
after collecting all our resources?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thirty-nine millions two
hundred and sixty thousand."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is correct, Bernouin;
that is all I wanted to know.  Leave us now," said the cardinal,
fixing his brilliant eye upon the young king, who sat mute with
stupefaction.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "However - " stammered the
king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What, do you still doubt,
sire?" said the cardinal.  "Well, here is a proof of what I
said."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                And Mazarin drew from under
his bolster the paper covered with figures, which he presented to
the king, who turned away his eyes, his vexation was so deep.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Therefore, as it is a
million you want, sire, and that million is not set down here, it
is forty-six millions your majesty stands in need of.  Well, I
don't think that any Jews in the world would lend such a sum,
even upon the crown of France."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king, clenching his
hands beneath his ruffles, pushed away his chair.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So it must be then!" said
he; "my brother the king of England will die of hunger."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire," replied Mazarin, in
the same tone, "remember this proverb, which I give you as the
expression of the soundest policy: 'Rejoice at being poor when
your neighbor is poor likewise.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis meditated this for a
few moments, with an inquisitive glance directed to the paper,
one end of which remained under the bolster.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then," said he, "it is
impossible to comply with my demand for money, my lord cardinal,
is it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Absolutely, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Remember, this will secure
me a future enemy, if he succeed in recovering his crown without
my assistance."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "If your majesty only fears
that, you may be quite at ease," replied Mazarin, eagerly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very well, I say no more
about it," exclaimed Louis XIV.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Have I at least convinced
you, sire?" placing his hand upon that of the young king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Perfectly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "If there be anything else,
ask it, sire; I shall most happy to grant it to you, having
refused this."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Anything else, my
lord?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why yes; am I not devoted
body and soul to your majesty?  <i>Hol&agrave;!</i>  Bernouin! -
lights and guards for his majesty!  His majesty is returning to
his own chamber."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Not yet, monsieur: since
you place your good-will at my disposal, I will take advantage of
it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "For yourself, sire?" asked
the cardinal, hoping that his niece was at length about to be
named.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, monsieur, not for
myself," replied Louis, "but still for my brother Charles."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The brow of Mazarin again
became clouded, and he grumbled a few words that the king could
not catch.</p>

hesitation with which he had accosted the cardinal a quarter of
an hour before, there might be read in the eyes of the young king
that will against which a struggle might be maintained, and which
might be crushed by its own impotence, but which, at least, would
preserve, like a wound in the depth of the heart, the remembrance
of its defeat.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This time, my lord
cardinal, we have to deal with something more easily found than a
million."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do you think so, sire?"
said Mazarin, looking at the king with that penetrating eye which
was accustomed to read to the bottom of hearts.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, I think so; and when
you know the object of my request - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And do you think I do not
know it, sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You know what remains for
me to say to you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Listen, sire; these are
King Charles's own words - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, impossible!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Listen.  'And if that
miserly, beggarly Italian,' said he - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord cardinal!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is the sense, if not
the words.  Eh!  Good heavens!  I wish him no ill on that
account; one is biased by his passions.  He said to you: 'If that
vile Italian refuses the million we ask of him, sire, - if we are
forced, for want of money, to renounce diplomacy, well, then, we
will ask him to grant us five hundred gentlemen.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king started, for the
cardinal was only mistaken in the number.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is not that it, sire?"
cried the minister, with a triumphant accent.  "And then he added
some fine words: he said, 'I have friends on the other side of
the channel, and these friends only want a leader and a banner. 
When they see me, when they behold the banner of France, they
will rally around me, for they will comprehend that I have your
support.  The colors of the French uniform will be worth as much
to me as the million M. de Mazarin refuses us,' - for he was
pretty well assured I should refuse him that million. - 'I shall
conquer with these five hundred gentlemen, sire, and all the
honor will be yours.'  Now, that is what he said, or to that
purpose, was it not? - turning those plain words into brilliant
metaphors and pompous images, for they are fine talkers in that
family!  The father talked even on the scaffold."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The perspiration of shame
stood on the brow of Louis.  He felt that it was inconsistent
with his dignity to hear his brother thus insulted, but he did
not yet know how to act with him to whom every one yielded, even
his mother.  At last he made an effort.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But," said he, "my lord
cardinal, it is not five hundred men, it is only two
hundred."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, but you see I guessed
what he wanted."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I never denied that you had
a penetrating eye, and that was why I thought you would not
refuse my brother Charles a thing so simple and so easy to grant
him as what I ask of you in his name, my lord cardinal, or rather
in my own."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire," said Mazarin, "I
have studied policy thirty years; first, under the auspices of M.
le Cardinal Richelieu; and then alone.  This policy has not
always been over-honest, it must be allowed, but it has never
been unskillful.  Now that which is proposed to you majesty is
dishonest and unskillful at the same time."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Dishonest, monsieur!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, you entered into a
treaty with Cromwell."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, and in that very
treaty Cromwell signed his name above mine."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why did you sign yours so
lo down, sire?  Cromwell found a good place, and he took it; that
was his custom.  I return, then, to M. Cromwell.  You have a
treaty with him, that is to say, with England, since when you
signed that treaty M. Cromwell was England."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "M. Cromwell is dead."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do you think so, sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No doubt he is, since his
son Richard has succeeded him, and has abdicated."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, that is it exactly. 
Richard inherited after the death of his father, and England at
the abdication of Richard.  The treaty formed part of the
inheritance, whether in the hands of M. Richard or in the hands
of England.  The treaty is, then, still as good, as valid as
ever.  Why should you evade it, sire?  What is changed?  Charles
wants to-day what we were not willing to grant him ten years ago;
but that was foreseen and provided against.  You are the ally of
England, sire, and not of Charles II.  It was doubtless wrong,
from a family point of view, to sign a treaty with a man who had
cut off the head of the king your father's brother-in-law, and to
contract an alliance with a parliament which they call yonder the
Rump Parliament; it was unbecoming, I acknowledge, but it was not
unskillful from a political point of view, since, thanks to that
treaty, I saved your majesty, then a minor, the trouble and
danger of a foreign war, which the Fronde - you remember the
Fronde, sire?" - the young king hung his head - "which the Fronde
might have fatally complicated.  And thus I prove to your majesty
that to change our plan now, without warning our allies, would be
at once unskillful and dishonest.  We should make war with the
aggression on our side; we should make it, deserving to have it
made against us; and we should have the appearance of fearing it
whilst provoking it, for a permission granted to five hundred
men, to two hundred men, to fifty men, to ten men, is still a
permission.  One Frenchman, that is the nation; one uniform, that
is the army.  Suppose, sire, for example, that you should have
war with Holland, which, sooner or later, will certainly happen;
or with Spain, which will perhaps ensue if your marriage fails"
(Mazarin stole a furtive glance at the king), "and there are a
thousand causes that might yet make your marriage fail, - well,
would you approve of England's sending to the United Provinces or
to Spain a regiment, a company, a squadron even, of English
gentlemen?  Would you think that they kept within the limits of
their treaty of alliance?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis listened; it seemed so
strange to him that Mazarin should invoke good faith, and he the
author of so many political tricks, called Mazarinades.  "And
yet," said the king, "without manifest of my authorization, I
cannot prevent gentlemen of my states from passing over into
England, if such should be their good pleasure."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You should compel them to
return, sire, or at least protest against their presence as
enemies in a allied country."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But come, my lord cardinal,
you who are so profound a genius, try if you cannot find a means
to assist this poor king, without compromising ourselves."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And that is exactly what I
am not willing to do, my dear sire," said Mazarin.  "If England
were to act exactly according to my wishes, she could not act
better than she does; if I directed the policy of England from
this place, I should not direct it otherwise.  Governed as she is
governed, England is an eternal nest of contention for all
Europe.  Holland protects Charles II., let Holland do so; they
will quarrel, they will fight.  Let them destroy each other's
navies, we can construct ours with the wrecks of their vessels;
when we shall save our money to buy nails."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, how paltry and mean is
all this that you are telling me, monsieur le cardinal!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, but nevertheless it is
true, sire; you must confess that.  Sill further.  Suppose I
admit, for a moment, the possibility of breaking your word, and
evading the treaty - such a thing as sometimes happens, but that
is when some great interest is to be promoted by it, or when the
treaty is found to be too troublesome - well, you will authorize
the engagement asked of you: France - her banner, which is the
same thing - will cross the Straits and will fight; France will
be conquered."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why so?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Ma foi!</i> we have a
pretty general to fight under - this Charles II.!  Worcester gave
us proofs of that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But he will no longer have
to deal with Cromwell, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But he will have to deal
with Monk, who is quite as dangerous.  The brave brewer of whom
we are speaking, was a visionary; he had moments of exaltation,
of inflation, during which he ran over like an over-filled cask;
and from the chinks there always escaped some drops of his
thoughts, and by the sample the whole of his thought was to be
made out.  Cromwell has thus allowed us more than ten times to
penetrate into his very soul, when one would have conceived that
soul to be enveloped in triple brass, as Horace had it.  But
Monk!  Oh, sire, God defend you from ever having anything to
transact politically with Monk.  It is he who has given me, in
one year, all the gray hairs I have.  Monk is no fanatic;
unfortunately he is a politician; he does not overflow, he keeps
close together.  For ten years he has had his eyes fixed upon one
object, and nobody has yet been able to ascertain what.  Every
morning, as Louis XI. advised, he burns his nightcap.  Therefore,
on the day when this plan, slowly and solitarily ripened, shall
break forth, it will break forth with all the conditions of
success which always accompany an unforeseen event.  That is
Monk, sire, of whom, perhaps, you have never even heard - of
whom, perhaps, you did not even know the name, before your
brother, Charles II., who knows what he is, pronounced it before
you.  He is a marvel of depth and tenacity, the two only things
against which intelligence and ardor are blunted.  Sire, I had
ardor when I was young; I always was intelligent.  I may safely
boast of it, because I am reproached with it.  I have done very
well with these two qualities, since, from the son of a fisherman
of Piscina, I have become prime minister to the king of France;
and in that position your majesty will perhaps acknowledge I have
rendered some service to the throne of your majesty.  Well, sire,
if I had met with Monk on my way, instead of Monsieur de
Beaufort, Monsieur de Retz, or Monsieur le Prince - well, we
should have been ruined.  If you engage yourself rashly, sire,
you will fall into the talons of this politic soldier.  The
casque of Monk, sire, is an iron coffer, and no one has the key
of it.  Therefore, near him, or rather before him, I bow, sire,
for I have nothing but a velvet cap."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What do you think Monk
wishes to do, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eh! sire, if I knew that, I
would not tell you to mistrust him, for I should be stronger than
he; but with him, I am afraid to guess - to guess! - you
understand my word? - for if I thought I had guessed, I should
stop at an idea, and, in spite of myself, should pursue that
idea.  Since that man has been in power yonder, I am like one of
the damned in Dante whose neck Satan has twisted, and who walk
forward looking around behind them.  I am traveling towards
Madrid, but I never lose sight of London.  To guess, with that
devil of a man, is to deceive one's self and to deceive one's
self is to ruin one's self.  God keep me from ever seeking to
guess what he aims at; I confine myself to watching what he does,
and that is well enough.  Now I believe - you observe the meaning
of the word <i>I believe?</i> - <i>I believe</i>, with respect to
Monk, ties one to nothing - I believe that he has a strong
inclination to succeed Cromwell.  Your Charles II. has already
caused proposals to be made to him by ten persons; he has
satisfied himself with driving these ten meddlers from his
presence, without saying anything to them but, 'Begone, or I will
have you hung.'  That man is a sepulcher!  At this moment Monk is
affecting devotion to the Rump Parliament; of this devotion, I am
not the dupe.  Monk has no wish to be assassinated, - an
assassination would stop him in the middle of his operations; and
his work must be accomplished; - so I believe - but do not
believe what I believe, sire: for as I say I believe from habit -
I believe that Monk is keeping on friendly terms with the
parliament till the day comes for dispersing it.  You are asked
for swords, but they are to fight against Monk.  God preserve you
from fighting against Monk, sire; for Monk would beat us, and I
should never console myself after being beaten by Monk.  I should
say to myself, Monk has foreseen that victory ten years.  For
God's sake, sire, out of friendship for you, if not out of
consideration for himself, let Charles II. keep quiet.  Your
majesty will give him a little income here; give him one of your
ch&acirc;teaux.  Yes, yes - wait awhile.  But I forget the treaty
- that famous treaty of which we were just now speaking.  Your
majesty has not even the right to give him a ch&acirc;teau."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How is that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, yes; your majesty is
bound not to grant hospitality to King Charles, and to compel him
to leave France even.  It was on this account we forced him to
quit you, and yet here he is again.  Sire, I hope you will give
your brother to understand that he cannot remain with us; that it
is impossible he should be allowed to compromise us; or I myself
- "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Enough, my lord," said
Louis XIV., rising.  "In refusing me a million, perhaps you may
be right; your millions are your own.  In refusing me two hundred
gentlemen, you are still further in the right; for you are prime
minister, and you have, in the eyes of France, the responsibility
of peace and war.  But that you should pretend to prevent me, who
am king, from extending my hospitality to the grandson of Henry
IV., to my cousin-german, to the companion of my childhood -
there your power stops, and there begins my will."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire," said Mazarin,
delighted at being let off so cheaply, and who had, besides, only
fought so earnestly to arrive at that, - "sire, I shall always
bend before the will of my king.  Let my king, then, keep near
him, or in one of his ch&acirc;teaux, the king of England; let
Mazarin know it, but let not the minister know it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good-night, my lord," said
Louis XIV., "I go away in despair."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But convinced, and that is
all I desire, sire," replied Mazarin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king made no answer, and
retired quite pensive, convinced, not of all Mazarin had told
him, but of one thing which he took care not to mention to him;
and that was, that it was necessary for him to study seriously
both his own affairs and those of Europe, for he found them very
difficult and very obscure.  Louis found the king of England
seated in the same place where he had left him.  On perceiving
him, the English prince arose; but at the first glance he saw
discouragement written in dark letters upon his cousin's brow. 
Then, speaking first, as if to facilitate the painful avowal that
Louis had to make to him, -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Whatever it may be," said
he, "I shall never forget all the kindness, all the friendship
you have exhibited towards me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Alas!" replied Louis, in a
melancholy tone, "only barren good-will, my brother."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Charles II. became extremely
pale; he passed his cold hand over his brow, and struggled for a
few instants against a faintness that made him tremble.  "I
understand," said he at last; "no more hope!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis seized the hand of
Charles II. "Wait, my brother," said he; "precipitate nothing;
everything may change; hasty resolutions ruin all causes; add
another year of trial, I implore you, to the years you have
already undergone.  You have, to induce you to act now rather
than at another time, neither occasion nor opportunity.  Come
with me, my brother; I will give you one of my residences,
whichever you prefer, to inhabit.  I, with you, will keep my eyes
upon events; we will prepare.  Come, then, my brother, have
courage!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Charles II. withdrew his
hand from that of the king, and drawing back, to salute him with
more ceremony, "With all my heart, thanks!" replied he, "sire;
but I have prayed without success to the greatest king on earth;
now I will go and ask a miracle of God."  And he went out without
being willing to hear any more, his head carried loftily, his
hand trembling, with a painful contraction of his noble
countenance, and that profound gloom which, finding no more hope
in the world of men, appeared to go beyond it, and ask it in
worlds unknown.  The officer of musketeers, on seeing him pass by
thus pale, bowed almost to his knees as he saluted him.  He then
took a flambeau, called two musketeers, and descended the
deserted staircase with the unfortunate king, holding in his left
hand his hat, the plume of which swept the steps.  Arrived at the
door, the musketeer asked the king which way he was going, that
he might direct the musketeers.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," replied Charles
II., in a subdued voice, "you who have known my father, say, did
you ever pray for him?  If you have done so, do not forget me in
your prayers.  Now, I am going alone, and beg of you not to
accompany me, or have me accompanied any further."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The officer bowed and sent
away the musketeers into the interior of the palace.  But he
himself remained an instant under the porch watching the
departing Charles II., till he was lost in the turn of the next
street.  "To him as to his father formerly," murmured he, "Athos,
if he were here, would say with reason, - 'Salute fallen
majesty!'"  Then, reascending the staircase: "Oh! the vile
service that I follow!" said he at every step.  "Oh! my pitiful
master!  Life thus carried on is no longer tolerable, and it is
at length time that I should do something!  No more generosity,
no more energy!  The master has succeeded, the pupil is starved
forever.  <i>Mordioux!</i>  I will not resist.  Come, you men,"
continued he, entering the ante-chamber, "why are you all looking
at me so?  Extinguish these torches and return to your posts. 
Ah! you were guarding me?  Yes, you watch over me, do you not,
worthy fellows?  Brave fools!  I am not the Duc de Guise. 
Begone!  They will not assassinate me in the little passage. 
Besides," added he, in a low voice, "that would be a resolution,
and no resolutions have been formed since Monsieur le Cardinal
Richelieu died.  Now, with all his faults, that was a man!  It is
settled: to-morrow I will throw my cassock to the nettles."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Then, reflecting: "No," said
he, "not yet!  I have one great trial to make and I will make it;
but that, and I swear it, shall be the last,
<i>Mordioux!</i>"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                He had not finished speaking
when a voice issued from the king's chamber.  "Monsieur le
lieutenant!" said this voice.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Here I am," replied he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The king desires to speak
to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Humph!" said the
lieutenant; "perhaps of what I was thinking about."  And he went
into the king's apartment.</p>

day?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And every night.  Yes,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, I cannot allow
that - I will have you rest."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is very kind, sire;
but I will not."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What do you say?" said the
king, who did not at first comprehend the full meaning of this
reply.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I say, sire, that I will
not expose myself to the chance of a fault.  If the devil had a
trick to play on me, you understand, sire, as he knows the man
with whom he has to deal, he would chose the moment when I should
not be there.  My duty and the peace of my conscience before
everything, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But such duty will kill
you, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eh! sire, I have performed
it for thirty years, and in all France and Navarre there is not a
man in better health than I am.  Moreover, I entreat you, sire,
not to trouble yourself about me.  That would appear very strange
to me, seeing that I am not accustomed to it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king cut short the
conversation by a fresh question.  "Shall you be here, then,
to-morrow morning?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "As at present? yes,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king walked several
times up and down his chamber; it was very plain that he burned
with a desire to speak, but that he was restrained by some fear
or other.  The lieutenant, standing motionless, hat in hand,
watched him making these evolutions, and, whilst looking at him,
grumbled to himself, biting his mustache:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He has not half a crown
worth of resolution!  <i>Parole d'honneur!</i>  I would lay a
wager he does not speak at all!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king continued to walk
about, casting from time to time a side glance at the
lieutenant.  "He is the very image of his father," continued the
latter, in is secret soliloquy, "he is at once proud, avaricious,
and timid.  The devil take his master, say I."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king stopped. 
"Lieutenant," said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am here, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why did you cry out this
evening, down below in the <i>salons</i> - 'The king's service! 
His majesty's musketeers!'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Because you gave me the
order, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yourself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Indeed, I did not say a
word, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, an order is given by
a sign, by a gesture, by a glance, as intelligibly, as freely,
and as clearly as by word of mouth.  A servant who has nothing
but ears is not half a good servant."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your eyes are very
penetrating, then, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How is that, sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Because they see what is
not."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My eyes are good, though,
sire, although they have served their master long and much: when
they have anything to see, they seldom miss the opportunity. 
Now, this evening, they saw that your majesty colored with
endeavoring to conceal the inclination to yawn, that your majesty
looked with eloquent supplications, first to his eminence, and
then at her majesty, the queen-mother, and at length to the
entrance door, and they so thoroughly remarked all I have said,
that they saw your majesty's lips articulate these words: 'Who
will get me out of this?'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Or something to this
effect, sire - 'My musketeers!'  I could then no longer
hesitate.  That look was for me.  I cried out instantly, 'His
majesty's musketeers!'  And, besides, that was shown to be true,
sire, not only by your majesty's not saying I was wrong, but
proving I was right by going out at once."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king turned away to
smile; then, after a few seconds, he again fixed his limpid eye
upon that countenance, so intelligent, so bold, and so firm, that
it might have been said to be the proud and energetic profile of
the eagle facing the sun.  "That is all very well," said he,
after a short silence, during which he endeavored, in vain, to
make his officer lower his eyes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                But seeing the king said no
more, the latter pirouetted on his heels, and took three steps
towards the door, muttering, "He will not speak!
<i> Mordioux!</i> he will not speak!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thank you, monsieur," said
the king at last.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Humph!" continued the
lieutenant; "there was only wanting that.  Blamed for having been
less of a fool than another might have been."  And he went to the
door, allowing his spurs to jingle in true military style.  But
when he was on the threshold, feeling the king's desire drew him
back, he returned.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Has your majesty told me
all?" asked he, in a tone we cannot describe, but which, without
appearing to solicit the royal confidence, contained so much
persuasive frankness, that the king immediately replied:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes; but draw near,
monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Now then," murmured the
officer, "he is coming to it at last."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Listen to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I shall not lose a word,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You will mount on horseback
to-morrow, at about half-past four in the morning, and you will
have a horse saddled for me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "From your majesty's
stables?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No; one of your musketeers'
horses."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very well, sire.  Is that
all?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you will accompany
me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Alone?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Alone."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Shall I come to seek your
majesty, or shall I wait?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You will wait for me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Where, sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "At the little
park-gate."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The lieutenant bowed,
understanding that the king had told him all he had to say.  In
fact, the king dismissed him with a gracious wave of the hand. 
The officer left the chamber of the king, and returned to place
himself philosophically in his <i>fauteuil</i>, where, far from
sleeping, as might have been expected, considering how late it
was, he began to reflect more deeply than he had ever reflected
before.  The result of these reflections was not so melancholy as
the preceding ones had been.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Come, he has begun," said
he.  "Love urges him on, and he goes forward - he goes forward! 
The king is nobody in his own palace; but the man perhaps may
prove to be worth something.  Well, we shall see to-morrow
morning.  Oh! oh!" cried he, all at once starting up, "that is a
gigantic idea, <i>mordioux!</i> and perhaps my fortune depends,
at least, upon that idea!"  After this exclamation, the officer
arose and marched, with his hands in the pockets of his
<i>justaucorps</i>, about the immense ante-chamber that served
him as an apartment.  The wax-light flamed furiously under the
effects of a fresh breeze, which stole in through the chinks of
the door and the window, and cut the <i>salle</i> diagonally.  It
threw out a reddish, unequal light, sometimes brilliant,
sometimes dull, and the tall shadow of the lieutenant was seen
marching on the wall, in profile, like a figure by Callot, with
his long sword and feathered hat.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Certainly!" said he, "I am
mistaken if Mazarin is not laying a snare for this amorous boy. 
Mazarin, this evening, gave an address, and made an appointment
as complacently as M. Daangeau himself could have done - I heard
him, and I know the meaning of his words.  'To-morrow morning,'
said he, 'they will pass opposite the bridge of Blois.' 
<i>Mordioux!</i> that is clear enough, and particularly for a
lover.  That is the cause of this embarrassment; that is the
cause of this hesitation; that is the cause of this order -
'Monsieur the lieutenant of my musketeers, be on horseback
to-morrow at four o'clock in the morning.'  Which is as clear as
if he had said, - 'Monsieur the lieutenant of my musketeers,
to-morrow, at four, at the bridge of Blois, - do you
understand?'  Here is a state secret, then, which I, humble as I
am, have in my possession, while it is in action.  And how do I
get it?  Because I have good eyes, as his majesty just now said. 
They say he loves this little Italian doll furiously.  They say
he threw himself at his mother's feet, to beg her to allow him to
marry her.  They say the queen went so far as to consult the
court of Rome, whether such a marriage, contracted against her
will, would be valid.  Oh, if I were but twenty-five!  If I had
by my side those I no longer have!  If I did not despise the
whole world most profoundly, I would embroil Mazarin with the
queen-mother, France with Spain, and I would make a queen after
my own fashion.  But let that pass."  And the lieutenant snapped
his fingers in disdain.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This miserable Italian -
this poor creature - this sordid wretch - who has just refused
the king of England a million, would not perhaps give me a
thousand pistoles for the news I would carry him.
 <i>Mordioux!</i>  I am falling into second childhood - I am
becoming stupid indeed!  The idea of Mazarin giving anything! ha!
ha! ha!" and he laughed in a subdued voice.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, let us go to sleep -
let us go to sleep; and the sooner the better.  My mind is
wearied with my evening's work, and will see things to-morrow
more clearly than to-day."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                And upon this
recommendation, made to himself, he folded his cloak around him,
looking with contempt upon his royal neighbor.  Five minutes
after this he was asleep, with his hands clenched and his lips
apart, giving escape, not to his secret, but to a sonorous sound,
which rose and spread freely beneath the majestic roof of the
ante-chamber.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>T</span>hesun had
scarcely shed its first beams on the majestic trees of the park
and the lofty turrets of the castle, when the young king, who had
been awake more than two hours, possessed by the sleeplessness of
love, opened his shutters himself, and cast an inquiring look
into the courts of the sleeping palace.  He saw that it was the
hour agreed upon: the great court clock pointed to a quarter past
four.  He did not disturb his <i>valet de chambre</i>, who was
sleeping soundly at some distance; he dressed himself, and the
valet, in a great fright, sprang up, thinking he had been
deficient in his duty; but the king sent him back again,
commanding him to preserve the most absolute silence.  He then
descended the little staircase, went out at a lateral door, and
perceived at the end of the wall a mounted horseman, holding
another horse by the bridle.  This horseman could not be
recognized in his cloak and slouched hat.  As to the horse,
saddled like that of a rich citizen, it offered nothing
remarkable to the most experienced eye.  Louis took the bridle:
the officer held the stirrup without dismounting, and asked his
majesty's orders in a low voice.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Follow me," replied the
king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The officer put his horse to
the trot, behind that of his master, and they descended the hill
towards the bridge.  When they reached the other side of the
Loire, -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," said the king,
"you will please to ride on till you see a carriage coming; then
return and inform me.  I will wait here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Will your majesty deign to
give me some description of the carriage I am charged to
discover?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A carriage in which you
will see two ladies, and probably their attendants likewise."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, I should not wish to
make a mistake; is there no other sign by which I may know this
carriage?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It will bear, in all
probability, the arms of monsieur le cardinal."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is sufficient, sire,"
replied the officer, fully instructed in the object of his
search.  He put his horse to the trot, and rode sharply on in the
direction pointed out by the king.  But he had scarcely gone five
hundred paces when he saw four mules, and then a carriage, loom
up from behind a little hill.  Behind this carriage came
another.  It required only one glance to assure him that these
were the equipages he was in search of; he therefore turned his
bridle, and rode back to the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire," said he, "here are
the carriages.  The first, as you said, contains two ladies with
their <i>femmes de chambre</i>; the second contains the footmen,
provisions, and necessaries."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is well," replied the
king in an agitated voice.  "Please to go and tell those ladies
that a cavalier of the court wishes to pay his respects to them
alone."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The officer set off at a
gallop.  "<i>Mordioux!</i>" said he, as he rode on, "here is a
new and honorable employment, I hope!  I complained of being
nobody.  I am the king's confidant: that is enough to make a
musketeer burst with pride."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                He approached the carriage,
and delivered his message gallantly and intelligently.  There
were two ladies in the carriage: one of great beauty, although
rather thin; the other less favored by nature, but lively,
graceful, and uniting in the delicate lines of her brow all the
signs of a strong will.  Her eyes, animated and piercing, in
particular, spoke more eloquently than all the amorous phrases in
fashion in those days of gallantry.  It was to her D'Artagnan
addressed himself, without fear of being mistaken, although the
other was, as we have said, the more handsome of the two.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Madame," said he, "I am the
lieutenant of the musketeers, and there is on the road a horseman
who awaits you, and is desirous of paying his respects to
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                At these words, the effect
of which he watched closely, the lady with the black eyes uttered
a cry of joy, leant out of the carriage window, and seeing the
cavalier approaching, held out her arms, exclaiming:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, my dear sire!" and the
tears gushed from her eyes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The coachman stopped his
team; the women rose in confusion from the back of the carriage,
and the second lady made a slight curtsey, terminated by the most
ironical smile that jealousy ever imparted to the lips of
woman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Marie, dear Marie," cried
the king, taking the hand of the black-eyed lady in both his. 
And opening the heavy door himself, he drew her out of the
carriage with so much ardor, that she was in his arms before she
touched the ground.  The lieutenant, posted on the other side of
the carriage, saw and heard all without being observed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king offered his arm to
Mademoiselle de Mancini, and made a sign to the coachman and
lackeys to proceed.  It was nearly six o'clock; the road was
fresh and pleasant; tall trees with their foliage still inclosed
in the golden down of their buds, let the dew of morning filter
from their trembling branches, like liquid diamonds; the grass
was bursting at the foot of the hedges; the swallows having
returned only a few days since, described their graceful curves
between the heavens and the water; a breeze, laden with the
perfumes of the blossoming woods, sighed along the road, and
wrinkled the surface of the waters of the river; all these
beauties of the day, all these perfumes of the plants, all these
aspirations of the earth towards heaven, intoxicated the two
lovers, walking side by side, leaning upon each other, eyes fixed
upon eyes, hand clasping hand, and who, lingering as by a common
desire, did not dare to speak, they had so much to say.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The officer saw that the
king's horse, in wandering this way and that, annoyed
Mademoiselle de Mancini.  He took advantage of the pretext of
securing the horse to draw near them, and dismounting, walked
between the two horses he led; he did not lose a single word or
gesture of the lovers.  It was Mademoiselle de Mancini who at
length began.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, my dear sire!" said
she, "you do not abandon me, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, Marie," replied the
king; "you see I do not."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I had so often been told,
though, that as soon as we should be separated you would no
longer think of me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Dear Marie, is it then
to-day only that you have discovered we are surrounded by people
interested in deceiving us?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But then, sire, this
journey, this alliance with Spain?  They are going to marry you
off!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis hung his head.  At the
same time the officer could see the eyes of Marie de Mancini
shine in the sun with the brilliancy of a dagger starting from
its sheath.  "And you have done nothing in favor of our love?"
asked the girl, after a silence of a moment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! mademoiselle, how could
you believe that?  I threw myself at the feet of my mother; I
begged her, I implored her; I told her all my hopes of happiness
were in you; I even threatened - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well?" asked Marie,
eagerly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, the queen-mother
wrote to the court of Rome, and received as answer, that a
marriage between us would have no validity, and would be
dissolved by the holy father.  At length, finding there was no
hope for us, I requested to have my marriage with the infanta at
least delayed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And yet that does not
prevent your being on the road to meet her?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How can I help it?  To my
prayers, to my supplications, to my tears, I received no answer
but reasons of state."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, well?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, what is to be done,
mademoiselle, when so many wills are leagued against me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                It was now Marie's turn to
hang her head.  "Then I must bid you adieu forever," said she. 
"You know that I am being exiled; you know that I am going to be
buried alive; you know still more that they want to marry me off,
too."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis became very pale, and
placed his hand upon his heart.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "If I had thought that my
life only had been at stake, I have been so persecuted that I
might have yielded; but I thought yours was concerned, my dear
sire, and I stood out for the sake of preserving your
happiness."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, yes! my happiness, my
treasure!" murmured the king, more gallantly than passionately,
perhaps.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The cardinal might have
yielded," said Marie, "if you had addressed yourself to him, if
you had pressed him.  For the cardinal to call the king of France
his nephew! do you not perceive, sire?  He would have made war
even for that honor; the cardinal, assured of governing alone,
under the double pretext of having brought up the king and given
his niece to him in marriage - the cardinal would have fought all
antagonists, overcome all obstacles.  Oh, sire!  I can answer for
that.  I am a woman, and I see clearly into everything where love
is concerned."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                These words produced a
strange effect upon the king.  Instead of heightening his
passion, they cooled it.  He stopped, and said hastily, -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What is to be said,
mademoiselle?  Everything has failed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Except your will, I trust,
my dear sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Alas!" said the king,
coloring, "have I a will?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!" said Mademoiselle de
Mancini mournfully, wounded by that expression.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The king has no will but
that which policy dictates, but that which reasons of state
impose upon him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! it is because you have
no love," cried Mary; "if you loved, sire, you would have a
will."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                On pronouncing these words,
Mary raised her eyes to her lover, whom she saw more pale and
more cast down than an exile who is about to quit his native land
forever.  "Accuse me," murmured the king, "but do not say I do
not love you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                A long silence followed
these words, which the young king had pronounced with a perfectly
true and profound feeling.  "I am unable to think that to-morrow,
and after to-morrow, I shall see you no more; I cannot think that
I am going to end my sad days at a distance from Paris; that the
lips of an old man, of an unknown, should touch that hand which
you hold within yours; no, in truth, I cannot think of all that,
my dear sire, without having my poor heart burst with
despair."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                And Marie de Mancini did
shed floods of tears.  On his part, the king, much affected,
carried his handkerchief to his mouth, and stifled a sob.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "See," said she, "the
carriages have stopped, my sister waits for me, the time is come;
what you are about to decide upon will be decided for life.  Oh,
sire! you are willing, then, that I should lose you?  You are
willing, then, Louis, that she to whom you have said 'I love
you,' should belong to another than to her king, to her master,
to her lover?  Oh! courage, Louis! courage!  One word, a single
word!  Say 'I will!' and all my life is enchained to yours, and
all my heart is yours forever."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king made no reply. 
Mary then looked at him as Dido looked at &AElig;neas in the
Elysian fields, fierce and disdainful.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Farewell, then," said she;
"farewell life! love! heaven!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                And she took a step away. 
The king detained her, seizing her hand, which he pressed to his
lips, and despair prevailing over the resolution he appeared to
have inwardly formed, he let fall upon that beautiful hand a
burning tear of regret, which made Mary start, so really had that
tear burnt her.  She saw the humid eyes of the king, his pale
brow, his convulsed lips, and cried, with an accent that cannot
be described, -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, sire! you are a king,
you weep, and yet I depart!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                As his sole reply, the king
hid his face in his handkerchief.  The officer uttered something
so like a roar that it frightened the horses.  Mademoiselle de
Mancini, quite indignant, quitted the king's arm, hastily entered
the carriage, crying to the coachman, "Go on, go on, and
quick!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The coachman obeyed,
flogging his mules, and the heavy carriage rocked upon its
creaking axle, whilst the king of France, alone, cast down,
annihilated, did not dare to look either behind or before
him.</p>

somewhat calming the agitation of his heart and thoughts, he
recollected that he was not alone.  The officer still held the
horse by the bridle, and had not lost all hope of seeing the king
recover his resolution.  He had still the resource of mounting
and riding after the carriage; they would have lost nothing by
waiting a little.  But the imagination of the lieutenant of the
musketeers was too rich and too brilliant; it left far behind it
that of the king, who took care not to allow himself to be
carried away to such excess.  He contented himself with
approaching the officer, and in a doleful voice, "Come," said he,
"let us be gone; all is ended.  To horse!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The officer imitated this
carriage, this slowness, this sadness, and leisurely mounted his
horse.  The king pushed on sharply, the lieutenant followed him. 
At the bridge Louis turned around for the last time.  The
lieutenant, patient as a god who has eternity behind and before
him, still hoped for a return of energy.  But it was groundless,
nothing appeared.  Louis gained the street which led to the
castle, and entered as seven was striking.  When the king had
returned, and the musketeer, who saw everything, had seen a
corner of the tapestry over the cardinal's window lifted up, he
breathed a profound sigh, like a man unloosed from the tightest
bonds, and said in a low voice:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Now then, my officer, I
hope that it is over."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king summoned his
gentleman.  "Please to understand I shall receive nobody before
two o'clock," said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire," replied the
gentleman, "there is, however, some one who requests
admittance."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who is that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your lieutenant of
musketeers."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He who accompanied me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah," said the king, "let
him come in."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The officer entered.  The
king made a sign, and the gentleman and the valet retired.  Louis
followed them with his eyes until they had shut the door, and
when the tapestries had fallen behind them, - "You remind me by
your presence, monsieur, of something I had forgotten to
recommend to you, that is to say, the most absolute
discretion."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! sire, why does your
majesty give yourself the trouble of making me such a
recommendation?  It is plain you do not know me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur, that is
true.  I know that you are discreet; but as I had prescribed
nothing - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The officer bowed.  "Has
your majesty nothing else to say to me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, monsieur; you may
retire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Shall I obtain permission
not to do so till I have spoken to the king, sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What do you have to say to
me?  Explain yourself, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, a thing without
importance to you, but which interests me greatly.  Pardon me,
then, for speaking of it.  Without urgency, without necessity, I
never would have done it, and I would have disappeared, mute and
insignificant as I always have been."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How!  Disappeared!  I do
not understand you, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, in a word," said the
officer, "I am come to ask for my discharge from your majesty's
service."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king made a movement of
surprise, but the officer remained as motionless as a statue.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your discharge - yours,
monsieur? and for how long a time, I pray?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, forever, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What, you are desirous of
quitting my service, monsieur?" said Louis, with an expression
that revealed something more than surprise.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, I regret to say that
I am."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Impossible!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is so, however, sire.  I
am getting old; I have worn harness now thirty-five years; my
poor shoulders are tired; I feel that I must give place to the
young.  I don't belong to this age; I have still one foot in the
old one; it results that everything is strange in my eyes,
everything astonishes and bewilders me.  In short, I have the
honor to ask your majesty for my discharge."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," said the king,
looking at the officer, who wore his uniform with an ease that
would have caused envy in a young man, "you are stronger and more
vigorous than I am."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!" replied the officer,
with an air of false modesty, "your majesty says so because I
still have a good eye and a tolerably firm foot - because I can
still ride a horse, and my mustache is black; but, sire, vanity
of vanities all that - illusions all that - appearance, smoke,
sire!  I have still a youthful air, it is true, but I feel old,
and within six months I am certain I shall be broken down, gouty,
impotent.  Therefore, then, sire - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," interrupted the
king, "remember your words of yesterday.  You said to me in this
very place where you now are, that you were endowed with the best
health of any man in France; that fatigue was unknown to you!
that you did not mind spending whole days and nights at your
post.  Did you tell me that, monsieur, or not?  Try and recall,
monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The officer sighed.  "Sire,"
said he, "old age is boastful; and it is pardonable for old men
to praise themselves when others no longer do it.  It is very
possible I said that; but the fact is, sire, I am very much
fatigued, an request permission to retire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," said the king,
advancing towards the officer with a gesture full of majesty,
"you are not assigning me the true reason.  You wish to quit my
service, it may be true, but you disguise from me the motive of
your retreat."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, believe that - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I believe what I see,
monsieur; I see a vigorous, energetic man, full of presence of
mind, the best soldier in France, perhaps; and this personage
cannot persuade me the least in the world that he stands in need
of rest."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! sire," said the
lieutenant, with bitterness, "what praise!  Indeed, your majesty
confounds me!  Energetic, vigorous, brave, intelligent, the best
soldier in the army!  But, sire, your majesty exaggerates my
small portion of merit to such a point, that however good an
opinion I may have of myself, I do not recognize myself; in truth
I do not.  If I were vain enough to believe only half of your
majesty's words, I should consider myself a valuable,
indispensable man.  I should say that a servant possessed of such
brilliant qualities was a treasure beyond all price.  Now, sire,
I have been all my life - I feel bound to say it - except at the
present time, appreciated, in my opinion, much below my value.  I
therefore repeat, your majesty exaggerates."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king knitted his brow,
for he saw a bitter raillery beneath the words of the officer. 
"Come, monsieur," said he, "let us meet the question frankly. 
Are you dissatisfied with my service, say?  No evasions; speak
boldly, frankly - I command you to do so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The officer, who had been
twisting his hat about in his hands, with an embarrassed air, for
several minutes, raised his head at these words.  "Oh! sire,"
said he, "that puts me a little more at my ease.  To a question
put so frankly, I will reply frankly.  To tell the truth is a
good thing, as much from the pleasure one feels in relieving
one's heart, as on account of the rarity of the fact.  I will
speak the truth, then, to my king, at the same time imploring him
to excuse the frankness of an old soldier."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis looked at his officer
with anxiety, which he manifested by the agitation of his
gesture.  "Well, then, speak," said he, "for I am impatient to
hear the truths you have to tell me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The officer threw his hat
upon a table, and his countenance, always so intelligent and
martial, assumed, all at once, a strange character of grandeur
and solemnity.  "Sire," said he, "I quit the king's service
because I am dissatisfied.  The valet, in these times, can
approach his master as respectfully as I do, can give him an
account of his labor, bring back his tools, return the funds that
have been intrusted to him, and say 'Master, my day's work is
done.  Pay me, if you please, and let us part.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur! monsieur!"
exclaimed the king, crimson with rage.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! sire," replied the
officer, bending his knee for a moment, "never was servant more
respectful than I am before your majesty; only you commanded me
to tell the truth.  Now I have begun to tell it, it must come
out, even if you command me to hold my tongue."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                There was so much resolution
expressed in the deep-sunk muscles of the officer's countenance,
that Louis XIV. had no occasion to tell him to continue; he
continued, therefore, whilst the king looked at him with a
curiosity mingled with admiration.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, I have, as I have
said, now served the house of France thirty-five years; few
people have worn out so many swords in that service as I have,
and the swords I speak of were good swords, too, sire.  I was a
boy, ignorant of everything except courage, when the king your
father guessed that there was a man in me.  I was a man, sire,
when the Cardinal de Richelieu, who was a judge of manhood,
discovered an enemy in me.  Sire, the history of that enmity
between the ant and the lion may be read from the first to the
last line, in the secret archives of your family.  If ever you
feel an inclination to know it, do so, sire; the history is worth
the trouble - it is I who tell you so.  You will there read that
the lion, fatigued, harassed, out of breath, at length cried for
quarter, and the justice must be rendered him to say, that he
gave as much as he required.  Oh! those were glorious times,
sire, strewed over with battles like one of Tasso's or Ariosto's
epics.  The wonders of those times, to which the people of ours
would refuse belief, were every-day occurrences.  For five years
together, I was a hero every day; at least, so I was told by
persons of judgment; and that is a long period for heroism, trust
me, sire, a period of five years.  Nevertheless, I have faith in
what these people told me, for the were good judges.  They were
named M. de Richelieu, M. de Buckingham, M. de Beaufort, M. de
Retz, a mighty genius himself in street warfare, - in short, the
king, Louis XIII., and even the queen, your noble mother, who one
day condescended to say, '<i>Thank you</i>.'  I don't know what
service I had had the good fortune to render her.  Pardon me,
sire, for speaking so boldly; but what I relate to you, as I have
already had the honor to tell your majesty, is history."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king bit his lips, and
threw himself violently on a chair.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I appear importunate to
your majesty," said the lieutenant.  "Eh! sire, that is the fate
of truth; she is a stern companion; she bristles all over with
steel; she wounds those whom she attacks, and sometimes him who
speaks her."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, monsieur," replied the
king: "I bade you speak - speak then."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "After the service of the
king and the cardinal, came the service of the regency, sire; I
fought pretty well in the Fronde - much less, though, than the
first time.  The men began to diminish in stature.  I have,
nevertheless, led your majesty's musketeers on some perilous
occasions, which stand upon the orders of the day of the
company.  Mine was a beautiful luck at that time.  I was the
favorite of M. de Mazarin.  Lieutenant here! lieutenant there!
lieutenant to the right! lieutenant to the left!  There was not a
buffet dealt in France, of which your humble servant did not have
the dealing; but soon France was not enough.  The cardinal sent
me to England on Cromwell's account; another gentleman who was
not over gentle, I assure you, sire.  I had the honor of knowing
him, and I was well able to appreciate him.  A great deal was
promised me on account of that mission.  So, as I did much more
than I had been bidden to do, I was generously paid, for I was at
length appointed captain of the musketeers; that is to say, the
most envied position in court, which takes precedence over the
marshals of France, and justly; for who says captain of the
musketeers says the flower of chivalry and king of the
brave."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Captain, monsieur!"
interrupted the king; "you make a mistake.  Lieutenant, you
mean."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Not at all, sire - I make
no mistake; your majesty may rely upon me in that respect. 
Monsieur le cardinal gave me the commission himself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But M. de Mazarin, as you
know better than anybody, does not often give, and sometimes
takes back what he has given; he took it back again as soon as
peace was made and he was no longer in want of me.  Certainly I
was not worthy to replace M. de Tr&eacute;ville, of illustrious
memory; but they had promised me, and they had given me; they
ought to have stopped there."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is that what dissatisfies
you monsieur?  Well, I shall make inquiries.  I love justice; and
your claim, though made in military fashion, does not displease
me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, sire!" said the
officer, "your majesty has ill understood me; I no longer claim
anything now."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Excess of delicacy,
monsieur; but I will keep my eye upon your affairs, and later -
"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, sire! what a word! -
later!  Thirty years have I lived upon that promising word, which
has been pronounced by so many great personages, and which your
mouth has, in its turn, just pronounced.  Later - that is how I
have received a score of wounds, and how I have reached
fifty-four years of age without ever having had a louis in my
purse, and without ever having met with a protector on my way, -
I who have protected so many people!  So I change my formula,
sire; and when any one says to me 'Later,' I reply '<i>Now</i>.' 
It is rest that I solicit, sire.  That may be easily granted me. 
That will cost nobody anything."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I did not look for this
language, monsieur, particularly from a man who has always lived
among the great.  You forget you are speaking to the king, to a
gentleman who is, I suppose, as of good a house as yourself; and
when <i>I</i> say later, I mean a certainty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I do not at all doubt it,
sire; but this is the end of the terrible truth I had to tell
you.  If I were to see upon that table a <i>marshal's</i> stick,
the sword of constable, the crown of Poland, instead of later, I
swear to you, sire, that I should still say <i>Now!</i>  Oh,
excuse me, sire!  I am from the country of your grandfather,
Henry IV.  I do not speak often: but when I do speak, I speak
all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The future of my reign has
little temptation for you, monsieur, it appears," said Louis,
haughtily.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Forgetfulness,
forgetfulness everywhere!" cried the officer, with a noble air;
"the master has forgotten the servant, so the servant is reduced
to forget his master.  I live in unfortunate times, sire.  I see
youth full of discouragement and fear, I see it timid and
despoiled, when it ought to be rich and powerful.  I yesterday
evening, for example, open the door to a king of England, whose
father, humble as I am, I was near saving, if God had not been
against me - God, who inspired His elect, Cromwell!  I open, I
said, the door, that is to say, the palace of one brother to
another brother, and I see - stop, sire, that is a load on my
heart! - I see the minister of that king drive away the
proscribed prince, and humiliate his master by condemning to want
another king, his equal.  Then I see my prince, who is young,
handsome and brave, who has courage in his heart and lightening
in his eye, - I see him tremble before a priest, who laughs at
him behind the curtain of his alcove, where he digests all the
gold of France, which he afterwards stuffs into secret coffers. 
Yes - I understand your looks, sire.  I am bold to madness; but
what is to be said?  I am an old man, and I tell you here, sire,
to you, my king, things which I would cram down the throat of any
one who should dare to pronounce them before me.  You have
commanded me to pour out the bottom of my heart before you, sire,
and I cast at the feet of your majesty the pent-up indignation of
thirty years, as I would pour out all my blood, if your majesty
commanded me to do so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king, without speaking a
word, wiped the drops of cold and abundant perspiration which
trickled from his temples.  The moment of silence which followed
this vehement outbreak represented for him who had spoken, and
for him who had listened, ages of suffering.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," said the king at
length, "you spoke the word forgetfulness.  I have heard nothing
but that word; I will reply, then, to it alone.  Others have
perhaps been able to forget, but I have not, and the proof is,
that I remember that one day of riot, that one day when the
furious people, raging and roaring as the sea, invaded the royal
palace; that one day when I feigned sleep in my bed, one man
alone, naked sword in hand, concealed behind my curtain, watched
over my life, ready to risk his own for me, as he had before
risked it twenty times for the lives of my family.  Was not the
gentleman, whose name I then demanded, called M. d'Artagnan? say,
monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your majesty has a good
memory," replied the officer, coldly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You see, then," continued
the king, "if I have such remembrances of my childhood, what an
amount I may gather in the age of reason."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your majesty has been
richly endowed by God," said the officer, in the same tone.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Come, Monsieur d'Artagnan,"
continued Louis, with feverish agitation, "ought you not to be
patient as I am?  Ought you not to do as I do?  Come!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And what do you do,
sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I wait."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your majesty may do so,
because you are young; but I, sire, have not time to wait; old
age is at my door, and death is behind it, looking into the very
depths of my house.  Your majesty is beginning life, its future
is full of hope and fortune; but I, sire, I am on the other side
of the horizon, and we are so far from each other, that I should
never have time to wait till your majesty came up to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis made another turn in
his apartment, still wiping the moisture from his brow, in a
manner that would have terrified his physicians, if his
physicians had witnessed the state his majesty was in.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is very well, monsieur,"
said Louis XIV., in a sharp voice; "you are desirous of having
your discharge, and you shall have it.  You offer me your
resignation of the rank of lieutenant of the musketeers?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I deposit it humbly at your
majesty's feet, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is sufficient.  I will
order your pension."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I shall have a thousand
obligations to your majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," said the king,
with a violent effort, "I think you are losing a good
master."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And I am sure of it,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Shall you ever find such
another?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, sire!  I know that your
majesty is alone in the world; therefore will I never again take
service with any other king upon earth, and will never again have
other master than myself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You say so?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I swear so, your
majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I shall remember that word,
monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan bowed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you know I have a good
memory," said the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire; and yet I should
desire that that memory should fail your majesty in this
instance, in order that you might forget all the miseries I have
been forced to spread before your eyes.  Your majesty is so much
above the poor and the mean, that I hope - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My majesty, monsieur, will
act like the sun, which looks upon all, great and small, rich and
poor, giving luster to some, warmth to others, and life to all. 
Adieu,  Monsieur d'Artagnan - adieu: you are free."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                And the king, with a hoarse
sob, which was lost in his throat, passed quickly into the next
room.  D'Artagnan took up his hat from the table on which he had
thrown in, and went out.</p>

not reached the bottom of the staircase, when the king called his
gentleman.  "I have a commission to give you, monsieur," said
he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am at your majesty's
commands."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Wait, then."  And the young
king began to write the following letter, which cost him more
than one sigh, although, at the same time, something like a
feeling of triumph glittered in his eyes:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "MY LORD CARDINAL, - Thanks
to your good counsels, and, above all, thanks to your firmness, I
have succeeded in overcoming a weakness unworthy of a king.  You
have too ably arranged my destiny to allow gratitude not to stop
me at the moment when I was about to destroy your work.  I felt I
was wrong to wish to make my life turn from the course you had
marked out for it.  Certainly it would have been a misfortune to
France and my family if a misunderstanding had taken place
between me and my minister.  This, however, would certainly have
happened if I had made your niece my wife.  I am perfectly aware
of this, and will henceforth oppose nothing to the accomplishment
of my destiny.  I am prepared, then, to wed the infanta, Maria
Theresa.  You may at once open the conference.  - Your
affectionate</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="right" style='text-align:right'>
LOUIS."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king, after reperusing
the letter, sealed it himself.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This letter for my lord
cardinal," said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The gentleman took it.  At
Mazarin's door he found Bernouin waiting with anxiety.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well?" asked the minister's
<i>valet de chambre</i>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," said the
gentleman, "here is a letter for his eminence."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A letter!  Ah! we expected
one after the little journey of the morning."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! you know, then, that
his majesty - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "As first minister, it
belongs to the duties of our charge to know everything.  And his
majesty prays and implores, I presume."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I don't know, but he sighed
frequently whilst he was writing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, yes, yes; we
understand all that; people sigh sometimes from happiness as well
as from grief, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And yet the king did not
look very happy when he returned, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You did not see clearly. 
Besides, you only saw his majesty on his return, for he was only
accompanied by the lieutenant of the guards.  But I had his
eminence's telescope; I looked through it when he was tired, and
I am sure they both wept."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well! was it for happiness
they wept?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, but for love, and they
vowed to each other a thousand tendernesses, which the king asks
no better to keep.  Now this letter is a beginning of the
execution."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And what does his eminence
think of this love, which is, by the bye, no secret to
anybody?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Bernouin took the gentleman
by the arm, and whilst ascending the staircase, - "In
confidence," said he, in a low voice, "his eminence looks for
success in the affair.  I know very well we shall have war with
Spain; but, bah! war will please the nobles.  My lord cardinal,
besides, can endow his niece royally, nay, more than royally. 
There will be money, festivities, and fire-works - everybody will
be delighted."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, for my part," replied
the gentleman, shaking his head, "it appears to me that this
letter is very light to contain all that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My friend," replied
Bernouin, "I am certain of what I tell you.  M. d'Artagnan
related all that passed to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ay, ay! and what did he
tell you?  Let us hear."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I accosted him by asking
him, on the part of the cardinal, if there were any news, without
discovering my designs, observe, for M. d'Artagnan is a cunning
hand.  'My dear Monsieur Bernouin,' he replied, 'the king is
madly in love with Mademoiselle de Mancini, that is all I have to
tell you.'  And then I asked him: 'Do you think, to such a degree
that it will urge him to act contrary to the designs of his
eminence?'  'Ah! don't ask me,' said he; 'I think the king
capable of anything; he has a will of iron, and what he wills he
wills in earnest.  If he takes it into his head to marry
Mademoiselle de Mancini, he will marry her, depend upon it.'  And
thereupon he left me and went straight to the stables, took a
horse, saddled it himself, jumped upon its back, and set off as
if the devil were at his heels."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So that you believe, then -
"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I believe that monsieur the
lieutenant of the guards knew more than he was willing to
say."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In you opinion, then, M.
d'Artagnan - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is gone, according to all
probability, after the exiles, to carry out all that can
facilitate the success of the king's love."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Chatting thus, the two
confidants arrived at the door of his eminence's apartment.  His
eminence's gout had left him; he was walking about his chamber in
a state of great anxiety, listening at doors and looking out of
windows.  Bernouin entered, followed by the gentleman, who had
orders from the king to place the letter in the hands of the
cardinal himself.  Mazarin took the letter, but before opening
it, he got up a ready smile, a smile of circumstance, able to
throw a veil over emotions of whatever sort they might be.  So
prepared, whatever was the impression received from the letter,
no reflection of that impression was allowed to transpire upon
his countenance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well," said he, when he had
read and reread the letter, "very well, monsieur.  Inform the
king that I thank him for his obedience to the wishes of the
queen-mother, and that I will do everything for the
accomplishment of his will."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The gentleman left the
room.  The door had scarcely closed before the cardinal, who had
no mask for Bernouin, took off that which had so recently covered
his face, and with a most dismal expression, - "Call M. de
Brienne," said he.  Five minutes afterward the secretary
entered.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," said Mazarin, "I
have just rendered a great service to the monarchy, the greatest
I have ever rendered it.  You will carry this letter, which
proves it, to her majesty the queen-mother, and when she shall
have returned it to you, you will lodge it in portfolio B., which
is filed with documents and papers relative to my ministry."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Brienne went as desired,
and, as the letter was unsealed, did not fail to read it on his
way.  There is likewise no doubt that Bernouin, who was on good
terms with everybody, approached so near to the secretary as to
be able to read the letter over his shoulder; so that the news
spread with such activity through the castle, that Mazarin might
have feared it would reach the ears of the queen-mother before M.
de Brienne could convey Louis XIV.'s letter to her.  A moment
after orders were given for departure, and M. de Cond&eacute;
having been to pay his respects to the king on his pretended
rising, inscribed the city of Poitiers upon his tablets, as the
place of sojourn and rest for their majesties.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Thus in a few instants was
unraveled an intrigue which had covertly occupied all the
diplomacies of Europe.  It had nothing, however, very clear as a
result, but to make a poor lieutenant of musketeers lose his
commission and his fortune.  It is true, that in exchange he
gained his liberty.  We shall soon know how M. d'Artagnan
profited by this.  For the moment, if the reader will permit us,
we shall return to the hostelry of <i>les Medici</i>, of which
one of the windows opened at the very moment the orders were
given for the departure of the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The window that opened was
that of one of the rooms of Charles II.  The unfortunate prince
had passed the night in bitter reflections, his head resting on
his hands, and his elbows on the table, whilst Parry, infirm and
old, wearied in body and in mind, had fallen asleep in a corner. 
A singular fortune was that of this faithful servant, who saw
beginning for the second generation the fearful series of
misfortunes which had weighed so heavily on the first.  When
Charles II. had well thought over the fresh defeat he had
experienced, when he perfectly comprehended the complete
isolation into which he had just fallen, on seeing his fresh hope
left behind him, he was seized as with a vertigo, and sank back
into the large armchair in which he was seated.  Then God took
pity on the unhappy prince, and sent to console him sleep, the
innocent brother of death.  He did not wake till half-past six,
that is to say, till the sun shone brightly into his chamber, and
Parry, motionless with fear of waking him, was observing with
profound grief the eyes of the young man already red with
wakefulness, and his cheeks pale with suffering and
privations.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                At length the noise of some
heavy carts descending towards the Loire awakened Charles.  He
arose, looked around him like a man who has forgotten everything,
perceived Parry, shook him by the hand, and commanded him to
settle the reckoning with Master Cropol&eacute;.  Master
Cropol&eacute;, being called upon to settle his account with
Parry, acquitted himself, it must be allowed, like an honest man;
he only made his customary remark, that the two travelers had
eaten nothing, which had the double disadvantage of being
humiliating for his kitchen, and of forcing him to ask payment
for a repast not consumed, but not the less lost.  Parry had
nothing to say to the contrary, and paid.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I hope," said the king, "it
has not been the same with the horses.  I don't see that they
have eaten at your expense, and it would be a misfortune for
travelers like us, who have a long journey to make, to have our
horses fail us."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                But Cropol&eacute;, at this
doubt, assumed his majestic air, and replied that the stables of
<i>les Medici</i> were not less hospitable than its
refectory.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king mounted his horse;
his old servant did the same, and both set out towards Paris,
without meeting a single person on their road, in the streets or
the faubourgs of the city.  For the prince the blow was the more
severe, as it was a fresh exile.  The unfortunates cling to the
smallest hopes, as the happy do to the greatest good; and when
they are obliged to quit the place where that hope has soothed
their hearts, they experience the mortal regret which the
banished man feels when he places his foot upon the vessel which
is to bear him into exile.  It appears that the heart already
wounded so many times suffers from the least scratch; it appears
that it considers as a good the momentary absence of evil, which
is nothing but the absence of pain; and that God, into the most
terrible misfortunes, has thrown hope as the drop of water which
the rich sinner in hell entreated of Lazarus.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                For one instant even the
hope of Charles II. had been more than a fugitive joy; - that was
when he found himself so kindly welcomed by his brother king;
then it had taken a form that had become a reality; then, all at
once, the refusal of Mazarin had reduced the fictitious reality
to the state of a dream.  This promise of Louis XIV., so soon
retracted, had been nothing but a mockery; a mockery like his
crown - like his scepter - like his friends - like all that had
surrounded his royal childhood, and which had abandoned his
proscribed youth.  Mockery! everything was a mockery for Charles
II. except the cold, black repose promised by death.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Such were the ideas of the
unfortunate prince while sitting listlessly upon his horse, to
which he abandoned the reins: he rode slowly along beneath the
warm May sun, in which the somber misanthropy of the exile
perceived a last insult to his grief.</p>

 </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>A</span> horseman
going rapidly along the road leading towards Blois, which he had
left nearly half an hour before, passed the two travelers, and,
though apparently in haste, raised his hat as he passed them. 
The king scarcely observed this young man, who was about
twenty-five years of age, and who, turning round several times,
made friendly signals to a man standing before the gate of a
handsome white-and-red house; that is to say, built of brick and
stone, with a slated roof, situated on the left hand of the road
the prince was traveling.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This man, old, tall, and
thin, with white hair, - we speak of the one standing by the
gate; - this man replied to the farewell signals of the young one
by signs of parting as tender as could have been made by a
father.  The young man disappeared at the first turn of the road,
bordered by fine trees, and the old man was preparing to return
to the house, when the two travelers, arriving in front of the
gate, attracted his attention.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king, as we have said,
was riding with his head cast down, his arms inert, leaving his
horse to go what pace he liked, whilst Parry, behind him, the
better to imbibe the genial influence of the sun, had taken off
his hat, and was looking about right and left.  His eyes
encountered those of the old man leaning against the gate; the
latter, as if struck by some strange spectacle, uttered an
exclamation, and made one step towards the two travelers.  From
Parry his eyes immediately turned towards the king, upon whom
they rested for an instant.  This examination, however rapid, was
instantly reflected in a visible manner upon the features of the
tall old man.  For scarcely had he recognized the younger of the
travelers - and we said recognized, for nothing but a perfect
recognition could have explained such an act - scarcely, we say,
had he recognized the younger of the two travelers, than he
clapped his hands together, with respectful surprise, and,
raising his hat from his head, bowed so profoundly that it might
have been said he was kneeling.  This demonstration, however
absent, or rather, however absorbed was the king in his
reflections, attracted his attention instantly; and checking his
horse and turning towards Parry, he exclaimed, "Good God, Parry,
who is that man who salutes me in such a marked manner?  Can he
know me, think you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Parry, much agitated and
very pale, had already turned his horse towards the gate.  "Ah,
sire!" said he, stopping suddenly at five or six paces' distance
from the still bending old man: "sire, I am seized with
astonishment, for I think I recognize that brave man.  Yes, it
must be he!  Will your majesty permit me to speak to him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Certainly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Can it be you, Monsieur
Grimaud?" asked Parry.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, it is I," replied the
tall old man, drawing himself up, but without losing his
respectful demeanor.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire," then said Parry, "I
was not deceived.  This good man is the servant of the Comte de
la F&egrave;re, and the Comte de la F&egrave;re, if you remember,
is the worthy gentleman of whom I have so often spoken to your
majesty that the remembrance of him must remain, not only in your
mind, but in your heart."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He who assisted my father
at his last moments?" asked Charles, evidently affected at the
remembrance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The same, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Alas!" said Charles; and
then addressing Grimaud, whose penetrating and intelligent eyes
seemed to search and divine his thoughts. - "My friend," said he,
"does your master, Monsieur le Comte de la F&egrave;re, live in
this neighborhood?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "There," replied Grimaud,
pointing with his outstretched arm to the white-and-red house
behind the gate.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And is Monsieur le Comte de
la F&egrave;re at home at present?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "At the back, under the
chestnut trees."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Parry," said the king, "I
will not miss this opportunity, so precious for me, to thank the
gentleman to whom our house is indebted for such a noble example
of devotedness and generosity.  Hold my horse, my friend, if you
please."  And, throwing the bridle to Grimaud, the king entered
the abode of Athos, quite alone, as one equal enters the dwelling
of another.  Charles had been informed by the concise explanation
of Grimaud, - "At the back, under the chestnut trees;" he left,
therefore, the house on the left, and went straight down the path
indicated.  The thing was easy; the tops of those noble trees,
already covered with leaves and flowers, rose above all the
rest.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                On arriving under the
lozenges, by turns luminous and dark, which checkered the ground
of this path according as the trees were more or less in leaf,
the young prince perceived a gentleman walking with his arms
behind him, apparently plunged in a deep meditation.  Without
doubt, he had often had this gentleman described to himself, for,
without hesitating, Charles II. walked straight up to him.  At
the sound of his footsteps, the Comte de la F&egrave;re raised
his head, and seeing an unknown man of noble and elegant carriage
coming towards him, he raised his hat and waited.  At some paces
from him, Charles II. likewise took off his hat.  Then, as if in
reply to the comte's mute interrogation, -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur le Comte," said
he, "I come to discharge a debt towards you.  I have, for a long
time, had the expression of a profound gratitude to bring you.  I
am Charles II., son of Charles Stuart, who reigned in England,
and died on the scaffold."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                On hearing this illustrious
name, Athos felt a kind of shudder creep through his veins, but
at the sight of the young prince standing uncovered before him,
and stretching out his hand towards him, two tears, for an
instant, dimmed his brilliant eyes.  He bent respectfully, but
the prince took him by the hand.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "See how unfortunate I am,
my lord count; it is only due to chance that I have met with
you.  Alas!  I ought to have people around me whom I love and
honor, whereas I am reduced to preserve their services in my
heart, and their names in my memory: so that if your servant had
not recognized mine, I should have passed by your door as by that
of a stranger."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is but too true," said
Athos, replying with his voice to the first part of the king's
speech, and with a bow to the second; "it is but too true,
indeed, that your majesty has seen many evil days."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And the worst, alas!"
replied Charles, "are perhaps still to come."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, let us hope."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Count, count," continued
Charles, shaking his head, "I entertained hope till last night,
and that of a good Christian, I swear."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos looked at the king as
if to interrogate him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, the history is soon
related," said Charles.  "Proscribed, despoiled, disdained, I
resolved, in spite of all my repugnance, to tempt fortune one
last time.  Is it not written above, that, for our family, all
good fortune and all bad fortune shall eternally come from
France?  You know something of that, monsieur, - you, who are one
of the Frenchmen whom my unfortunate father found at the foot of
his scaffold, on the day of his death, after having found them at
his right hand on the day of battle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire," said Athos modestly,
"I was not alone.  My companions and I did, under the
circumstances, our duty as gentlemen, and that was all.  Your
majesty was about to do me the honor to relate - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is true, I had the
protection, - pardon my hesitation, count, but, for a Stuart,
you, who understand everything, you will comprehend that the word
is hard to pronounce; - I had, I say, the protection of my cousin
the stadtholder of Holland; but without the intervention, or at
least without the authorization of France, the stadtholder would
not take the initiative.  I came, then, to ask this authorization
of the king of France, who has refused me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The king has refused you,
sire!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, not he; all justice
must be rendered to my younger brother Louis; but Monsieur de
Mazarin - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos bit his lips.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You perhaps think I should
have expected this refusal?" said the king, who had noticed the
movement.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That was, in truth, my
thought, sire," replied Athos, respectfully; "I know that Italian
of old."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then I determined to come
to the test, and know at once the last word of my destiny.  I
told my brother Louis, that, not to compromise either France or
Holland, I would tempt fortune myself in person, as I had already
done, with two hundred gentlemen, if he would give them to me;
and a million, if he would lend it me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, monsieur, I am
suffering at this moment something strange, and that is, the
satisfaction of despair.  There is in certain souls, - and I have
just discovered that mine is of the number,- a real satisfaction
in the assurance that all is lost, and the time is come to
yield."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, I hope," said Athos,
"that your majesty is not come to that extremity."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To say so, my lord count,
to endeavor to revive hope in my heart, you must have ill
understood what I have just told you.  I came to Blois to ask of
my brother Louis the alms of a million, with which I had the
hopes of re-establishing my affairs; and my brother Louis has
refused me.  You see, then, plainly, that all is lost."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Will your majesty permit me
to express a contrary opinion?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How is that, count?  Do you
think my heart of so low an order that I do not know how to face
my position?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, I have always seen
that it was in desperate positions that suddenly the great turns
of fortune have taken place."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thank you, count: it is
some comfort to meet with a heart like yours; that is to say,
sufficiently trustful in God and in monarchy, never to despair of
a royal fortune, however low it may be fallen.  Unfortunately, my
dear count, your words are like those remedies they call
'sovereign,' and which, though able to cure curable wounds or
diseases, fail against death.  Thank you for your perseverance in
consoling me, count, thanks for your devoted remembrance, but I
know in what I must trust - nothing will save me now.  And see,
my friend, I was so convinced, that I was taking the route of
exile, with my old Parry; I was returning to devour my poignant
griefs in the little hermitage offered me by Holland.  There,
believe me, count, all will soon be over, and death will come
quickly; it is called so often by this body, eaten up by its
soul, and by this soul, which aspires to heaven."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your majesty has a mother,
a sister, and brothers; your majesty is the head of the family,
and ought, therefore, to ask a long life of God, instead of
imploring Him for a prompt death.  Your majesty is an exile, a
fugitive, but you have right on your side; you ought to aspire to
combats, dangers, business, and not to rest in heavens."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Count," said Charles II.,
with a smile of indescribable sadness, "have you ever heard of a
king who reconquered his kingdom with one servant the age of
Parry, and with three hundred crowns which that servant carried
in his purse?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, sire; but I have heard
- and that more than once - that a dethroned king has recovered
his kingdom with a firm will, perseverance, some friends, and a
million skillfully employed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But you cannot have
understood me.  The million I asked of my brother Louis was
refused me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire," said Athos, "will
your majesty grant me a few minutes, and listen attentively to
what remains for me to say to you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Charles II. looked earnestly
at Athos.  "Willingly, monsieur," said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then I will show your
majesty the way," resumed the count, directing his steps towards
the house.  He then conducted the king to his study, and begged
him to be seated.  "Sire," said he, "your majesty just now told
me that, in the present state of England, a million would suffice
for the recovery of your kingdom."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To attempt it at least,
monsieur; and to die as a king if I should not succeed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, then, sire, let your
majesty, according to the promise you have made me, have the
goodness to listen to  what I have to say."  Charles made an
affirmative sign with his head.  Athos walked straight up to the
door, the bolts of which he drew, after looking to see if anybody
was near, and then returned.  "Sire," said he, "your majesty has
kindly remembered that I lent assistance to the very noble and
very unfortunate Charles I., when his executioners conducted him
from St. James's to Whitehall."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, certainly I do
remember it, and always shall remember it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, it is a dismal
history to be heard by a son who no doubt has had it related to
him many times; and yet I ought to repeat it to your majesty
without omitting one detail."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Speak on, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "When the king your father
ascended the scaffold, or rather when he passed from his chamber
to the scaffold, on a level with his window, everything was
prepared for his escape.  The executioner was got out of the way;
a hole contrived under the floor of his apartment; I myself was
beneath the funeral vault, which I heard all at once creak
beneath his feet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Parry has related to me all
these terrible details, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos bowed and resumed. 
"But here is something he had not related to you, sire, for what
follows passed between God, your father, and myself; and never
has the revelation of it been made even to my dearest friends. 
'Go a little further off,' said the august prisoner to the
executioner; 'it is but for an instant, and I know that I belong
to you; but remember not to strike till I give the signal.  I
wish to offer up my prayers in freedom."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Pardon me," said Charles
II., turning very pale," but you, count, who know so many details
of this melancholy event, - details which, as you said just now,
have never been revealed to any one, - do you know the name of
that infernal executioner, of that base wretch who concealed his
face that he might assassinate a king with impunity?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos became slightly pale. 
"His name?" said he, "yes, I know it, but cannot tell it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And what is become of him,
for nobody in England knows his destiny?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He is dead."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But he did not die in his
bed; he did not die a calm and peaceful death; he did not die the
death of the good?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He died a violent death, in
a terrible night, rendered so by the passions of man and a
tempest from God.  His body, pierced by a dagger, sank to the
depths of the ocean.  God pardon his murderer!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Proceed, then," said
Charles II., seeing that the count was unwilling to say more.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The king of England, after
having, as I have said, spoken thus to the masked executioner,
added, - 'Observe, you will not strike till I shall stretch out
my arms, saying - REMEMBER!'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I was aware," said Charles,
in an agitated voice, "that that was the last word pronounced by
my unfortunate father.  But why and for whom?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "For the French gentleman
placed beneath his scaffold."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "For you, then,
monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire; and every one of
the words which he spoke to me, through the planks of the
scaffold covered with a black cloth, still sounds in my ears. 
The king knelt down on one knee: 'Comte de la F&egrave;re,' said
he, 'are you there?'  'Yes, sire,' replied I.  Then the king
stooped towards the boards."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Charles II., also
palpitating with interest, burning with grief, stooped towards
Athos, to catch, one by one, every word that escaped from him. 
His head touched that of the comte.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then," continued Athos,
"the king stooped.  'Comte de la F&egrave;re,' said he, 'I could
not be saved by you: it was not to be.  Now, even though I commit
a sacrilege, I must speak to you.  Yes, I have spoken to men -
yes, I have spoken to God, and I speak to you the last.  To
sustain a cause which I thought sacred, I have lost the throne of
my fathers and the heritage of my children.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Charles II. concealed his
face in his hands, and a bitter tear glided between his white and
slender fingers.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "'I have still a million in
gold,' continued the king.  'I buried it in the vaults of the
castle of Newcastle, a moment before I left that city.'"  Charles
raised his head with an expression of such painful joy that it
would have drawn tears from any one acquainted with his
misfortunes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A million!" murmured he,
"Oh, count!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "'You alone know that this
money exists: employ it when you think it can be of the greatest
service to my eldest son.  And now, Comte de la F&egrave;re, bid
me adieu!'</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "'Adieu, adieu, sire!' cried
I."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Charles arose, and went and
leant his burning brow against the window.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It was then," continued
Athos, "that the king pronounced the word 'REMEMBER!' addressed
to me.  You see, sire, that I have remembered."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king could not resist or
conceal his emotion.  Athos beheld the movement of his shoulders,
which undulated convulsively; he heard the sobs which burst from
his over-charged breast.  He was silent himself, suffocated by
the flood of bitter remembrances he had just poured upon that
royal head.  Charles II., with a violent effort, left the window,
devoured his tears, and came and sat by Athos.  "Sire," said the
latter, "I thought till to-day that the time had not yet arrived
for the employment of that last resource; but, with my eyes fixed
upon England, I felt it was approaching.  To-morrow I meant to go
and inquire in what part of the world your majesty was, and then
I purposed going to you.  You come to me, sire; that is an
indication that God is with us."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord," said Charles, in
a voice choked by emotion, "you are, for me, what an angel sent
from heaven would be, - you are a preserver sent to me from the
tomb of my father himself; but, believe me, for ten years' civil
war has passed over my country, striking down men, tearing up
soil, it is no more probable that gold should remain in the
entrails of the earth, than love in the hearts of my
subjects."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, the spot in which his
majesty buried the million is well known to me, and no one, I am
sure, has been able to discover it.  Besides, is the castle of
Newcastle quite destroyed? Have they demolished it stone by
stone, and uprooted the soil to the last tree?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, it is still standing:
but at this moment General Monk occupies it and is encamped
there.  The only spot from which I could look for succor, where I
possess a single resource, you see, is invaded by my
enemies."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "General Monk, sire, cannot
have discovered the treasure which I speak of."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, but can I go and
deliver myself up to Monk, in order to recover this treasure? Ah!
count, you see plainly I must yield to destiny, since it strikes
me to the earth every time I rise.  What can I do with Parry as
my only servant, with Parry, whom Monk has already driven from
his presence?  No, no, no, count, we must yield to this last
blow."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But what your majesty
cannot do, and what Parry can no more attempt, do you not believe
that I could succeed in accomplishing?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You - you, count - you
would go?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "If it please your majesty,"
said Athos, bowing to the king, "yes, I will go, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What! you so happy here,
count?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am never happy when I
have a duty left to accomplish, and it is an imperative duty
which the king your father left me to watch over your fortunes,
and make a royal use of his money.  So, if your majesty honors me
with a sign, I will go with you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, monsieur!" said the
king, forgetting all royal etiquette and throwing his arms around
the neck of Athos, "you prove to me that there is a God in
heaven, and that this God sometimes sends messengers to the
unfortunate who groan on the earth."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos, exceedingly moved by
this burst of feeling of the young man, thanked him with profound
respect, and approached the window.  "Grimaud!" cried he, "bring
out my horses."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What, now - immediately!"
said the king.  "Ah, monsieur, you are indeed a wonderful
man!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire," said Athos, "I know
nothing more pressing than your majesty's service.  Besides,"
added he, smiling, "it is a habit contracted long since, in the
service of the queen your aunt, and of the king your father.  How
is it possible for me to lose it at the moment your majesty's
service calls for it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What a man!" murmured the
king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Then, after a moment's
reflection, - "But no, count, I cannot expose you to such
privations.  I have no means of rewarding such services."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bah!" said Athos,
laughing.  "Your majesty is joking; have you not a million? Ah!
why am I not possessed of half such a sum!  I would already have
raised a regiment.  But, thank God!  I have still a few rolls of
gold and some family diamonds left.  Your majesty will, I hope,
deign to share with a devoted servant."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "With a friend - yes, count,
but on condition that, in his turn, that friend will share with
me hereafter!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire!" said Athos, opening
a casket, form which he drew both gold and jewels, "you see,
sire, we are too rich.  Fortunately, there are four of us, in the
event of our meeting with thieves."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Joy made the blood rush to
the pale cheeks of Charles II., as he saw Athos's two horses, led
by Grimaud, already booted for the journey, advance towards the
porch.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Blaisois, this letter for
the Vicomte de Bragelonne.  For everybody else I am gone to
Paris.  I confide the house to you, Blaisois."  Blaisois bowed,
shook hands with Grimaud, and shut the gate.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>T</span>wo hours had
scarcely elapsed since the departure of the master of the house,
who, in Blaisois's sight, had taken the road to Paris, when a
horseman, mounted on a good pied horse, stopped before the gate,
and with a sonorous "<i>hol&agrave;!</i>" called the stable-boys,
who, with the gardeners, had formed a circle round Blaisois, the
historian-in-ordinary to the household of the ch&acirc;teau. 
This "<i>hol&agrave;</i> ," doubtless well known to Master
Blaisois, made him turn his head and exclaim - "Monsieur
d'Artagnan! run quickly, you chaps, and open the gate."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                A swarm of eight brisk lads
flew to the gate, which was opened as if it had been made of
feathers; and every one loaded him with attentions, for they knew
the welcome this friend was accustomed to receive from their
master; and for such remarks the eye of the valet may always be
depended upon.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah!" said M. d'Artagnan,
with an agreeable smile, balancing himself upon his stirrup to
jump to the ground, "where is that dear count?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! how unfortunate you
are, monsieur!" said Blaisois: "and how unfortunate will monsieur
le comte, our master, think himself when he hears of your
coming!  As ill luck will have it, monsieur le comte left home
two hours ago."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan did not trouble
himself about such trifles.  "Very good!" said he.  "You always
speak the best French in the world; you shall give me a lesson in
grammar and correct language, whilst I wait the return of your
master."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is impossible,
monsieur," said Blaisois; "you would have to wait too long."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Will he not come back
to-day, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, nor to-morrow, nor the
day after to-morrow.  Monsieur le comte has gone on a
journey."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A journey!" said
D'Artagnan, surprised; "that's a fable, Master Blaisois."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, it is no more
than the truth.  Monsieur has done me the honor to give me the
house in charge; and he added, with his voice so full of
authority and kindness - that is all one to me: 'You will say I
have gone to Paris.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well!" cried D'Artagnan,
"since he is gone towards Paris, that is all I wanted to know!
you should have told me so at first, booby!  He is then two hours
in advance?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I shall soon overtake him. 
Is he alone?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who is with him, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A gentleman whom I don't
know, an old man, and M. Grimaud."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Such a party cannot travel
as fast as I can - I will start."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Will monsieur listen to me
an instant?" said Blaisois, laying his hand gently on the reins
of the horse.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, if you don't favor me
with fine speeches, and make haste."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, then, monsieur, that
word Paris appears to me to be only an excuse."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, oh!" said D'Artagnan,
seriously, "an excuse, eh?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur: and monsieur
le comte is not going to Paris, I will swear."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What makes you think
so?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This, - M. Grimaud always
knows where our master is going; and he had promised me that the
first time he went to Paris, he would take a little money for me
to my wife."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What, have you a wife,
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I had one - she was of this
country; but monsieur thought her a noisy scold, and I sent her
to Paris; it is sometimes inconvenient, but very agreeable at
others."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I understand; but go on. 
You do not believe the count gone to Paris?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, monsieur; for then M.
Grimaud would have broken his word; he would have perjured
himself, and that is impossible."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is impossible,"
repeated D'Artagnan, quite in a study, because he was quite
convinced.  "Well, my brave Blaisois, many thanks to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Blaisois bowed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Come, you know I am not
curious - I have serious business with your master.  Could you
not, by a little bit of a word - you who speak so well - give me
to understand - one syllable only - I will guess the rest."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Upon my word, monsieur, I
cannot.  I am quite ignorant where monsieur le comte is gone.  As
to listening at doors, that is contrary to my nature; and
besides, it is forbidden here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My dear fellow," said
D'Artagnan, "this is a very bad beginning for me.  Never mind;
you know when monsieur le comte will return, at least?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "As little, monsieur, as the
place of his destination."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Come, Blaisois, come,
search."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur doubts my
sincerity?  Ah, monsieur, that grieves me much."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The devil take his gilded
tongue!" grumbled D'Artagnan.  "A clown with a word would be
worth a dozen of him.  Adieu!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, I have the honor
to present you my respects."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Cuistre!</i>" said
D'Artagnan to himself, "the fellow is unbearable."  He gave
another look up to the house, turned his horse's head, and set
off like a man who has nothing either annoying or embarrassing in
his mind.  When he was at the end of the wall, and out of sight,
- "Well, now, I wonder," said he, breathing quickly, "whether
Athos was at home.  No; all those idlers, standing with their
arms crossed, would have been at work if the eye of the master
was near.  Athos gone on a journey? - that is incomprehensible. 
Bah! it is all devilish mysterious!  And then - no - he is not
the man I want.  I want one of a cunning, patient mind.  My
business is at Melun, in a certain presbytery I am acquainted
with.  Forty-five leagues - four days and a half!  Well, it is
fine weather, and I am free.  Never mind the distance!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                And he put his horse into a
trot, directing his course towards Paris.  On the fourth day he
alighted at Melun, as he had intended.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan was never in the
habit of asking any one on the road for any common information. 
For these sorts of details, unless in very serious circumstances,
he confided in his perspicacity, which was so seldom at fault, in
his experience of thirty years, and in a great habit of reading
the physiognomies of houses, as well as those of men.  At Melun,
D'Artagnan immediately found the presbytery - a charming house,
plastered over red brick, with vines climbing along the gutters,
and a cross, in carved stone, surmounting the ridge of the roof. 
From the ground-floor of this house came a noise, or rather a
confusion of voices, like the chirping of young birds when the
brood is just hatched under the down.  One of these voices was
spelling the alphabet distinctly.  A voice thick, yet pleasant,
at the same time scolded the talkers and corrected the faults of
the reader.  D'Artagnan recognized that voice, and as the window
of the ground-floor was open, he leant down from his horse under
the branches and red fibers of the vine and cried, "Bazin, my
dear Bazin! good-day to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                A short, fat man, with a
flat face, a cranium ornamented with a crown of gray hairs, cut
short, in imitation of a tonsure, and covered with an old black
velvet cap, arose as soon as he heard D'Artagnan - we ought not
to say <i>arose</i>, but <i>bounded up</i>.  In fact, Bazin
bounded up, carrying with him his little low chair, which the
children tried to take away, with battles more fierce than those
of the Greeks endeavoring to recover the body of Patroclus from
the hands of the Trojans.  Bazin did more than bound; he let fall
both his alphabet and his ferule.  "You!" said he; "you, Monsieur
D'Artagnan?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, myself!  Where is
Aramis - no, M. le Chevalier d'Herblay - no, I am still mistaken
- Monsieur le Vicaire-G&eacute;n&eacute;ral?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, monsieur," said Bazin,
with dignity, "monseigneur is at his diocese."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What did you say?" said
D'Artagnan.  Bazin repeated the sentence.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, ah! but has Aramis a
diocese?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur.  Why
not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is he a bishop, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, where can you come
from," said Bazin, rather irreverently, "that you don't know
that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My dear Bazin, we pagans,
we men of the sword, know very well when a man is made a colonel,
or <i>ma&icirc;tre-de-camp</i>, or marshal of France; but if he
be made a bishop, arch-bishop, or pope - devil take me if the
news reaches us before the three quarters of the earth have had
the advantage of it!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Hush! hush!" said Bazin,
opening his eyes: "do not spoil these poor children, in whom I am
endeavoring to inculcate such good principles."  In fact, the
children had surrounded D'Artagnan, whose horse, long sword,
spurs, and martial air they very much admired.  But above all,
they admired his strong voice; so that, when he uttered his oath,
the whole school cried out, "The devil take me!" with fearful
bursts of laughter, shouts, and bounds, which delighted the
musketeer, and bewildered the old pedagogue.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "There!" said he, "hold your
tongues, you brats!  You have come, M. d'Artagnan, and all my
good principles fly away.  With you, as usual, comes disorder. 
Babel is revived.  Ah!  Good Lord!  Ah! the wild little
wretches!"  And the worthy Bazin distributed right and left blows
which increased the cries of his scholars by changing the nature
of them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "At least," said he, "you
will no longer decoy any one here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do you think so?" said
D'Artagnan, with a smile which made a shudder creep over the
shoulders of Bazin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He is capable of it,"
murmured he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Where is your master's
diocese?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monseigneur Ren&eacute; is
bishop of Vannes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who had him nominated?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, monsieur le
surintendant, our neighbor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What!  Monsieur
Fouquet?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To be sure he did."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is Aramis on good terms
with him, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monseigneur preached every
Sunday at the house of monsieur le surintendant at Vaux; then
they hunted together."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And monseigneur composed
his homilies - no, I mean his sermons - with monsieur le
surintendant."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bah! he preached in verse,
then, this worthy bishop?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, for the love of
heaven, do not jest with sacred things."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "There, Bazin, there!  So,
then, Aramis is at Vannes?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "At Vannes, in
Bretagne."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are a deceitful old
hunks, Bazin; that is not true."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "See, monsieur, if you
please; the apartments of the presbytery are empty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He is right there," said
D'Artagnan, looking attentively at the house, the aspect of which
announced solitude.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But monseigneur must have
written you an account of his promotion."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "When did it take
place?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A month back."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! then there is no time
lost.  Aramis cannot yet have wanted me.  But how is it, Bazin,
you do not follow your master?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, I cannot; I have
occupations."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your alphabet?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And my penitents."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What, do you confess,
then?  Are you a priest?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The same as one.  I have
such a call."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But the orders?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh," said Bazin, without
hesitation, "now that monseigneur is a bishop, I shall soon have
my orders, or at least my dispensations."  And he rubbed his
hands.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Decidedly," said D'Artagnan
to himself, "there will be no means of uprooting these people. 
Get me some supper, Bazin."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "With pleasure,
monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A fowl, a <i>bouillon</i>,
and a bottle of wine."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This is Saturday night,
monsieur - it is a day of abstinence."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have a dispensation,"
said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Bazin looked at him
suspiciously.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, ah, master hypocrite!"
said the musketeer, "for whom do you take me?  If you, who are
the valet, hope for dispensation to commit a crime, shall not I,
the friend of your bishop, have dispensation for eating meat at
the call of my stomach?  Make yourself agreeable with me, Bazin,
or by heavens!  I will complain to the king, and you shall never
confess.  Now you know that the nomination of bishops rests with
the king, - I have the king, I am the stronger."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Bazin smiled
hypocritically.  "Ah, but we have monsieur le surintendant," said
he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you laugh at the king,
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Bazin made no reply; his
smile was sufficiently eloquent.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My supper," said
D'Artagnan, "it is getting towards seven o'clock."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Bazin turned round and
ordered the eldest of the pupils to inform the cook.  In the
meantime, D'Artagnan surveyed the presbytery.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Phew!" said he,
disdainfully, "monseigneur lodged his grandeur very meanly
here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "We have the Ch&acirc;teau
de Vaux," said Bazin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Which is perhaps equal to
the Louvre?" said D'Artagnan, jeeringly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Which is better," replied
Bazin, with the greatest coolness imaginable.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, ah!" said
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                He would perhaps have
prolonged the discussion, and maintained the superiority of the
Louvre, but the lieutenant perceived that his horse remained
fastened to the bars of a gate.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The devil!" said he.  "Get
my horse looked after; your master the bishop has none like him
in his stables."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Bazin cast a sidelong glance
at the horse, and replied, "Monsieur le surintendant gave him
four from his own stables; and each of the four is worth four of
yours."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The blood mounted to the
face of D'Artagnan.  His hand itched and his eye glanced over the
head of Bazin, to select the place upon which he should discharge
his anger.  But it passed away; reflection came, and D'Artagnan
contented himself with saying, -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The devil! the devil!  I
have done well to quit the service of the king.  Tell me, worthy
Master Bazin," added he, "how many musketeers does monsieur le
surintendant retain in his service?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He could have all there are
in the kingdom with his money," replied Bazin, closing his book,
and dismissing the boys with some kindly blows of his cane.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The devil! the devil!"
repeated D'Artagnan, once more, as if to annoy the pedagogue. 
But as supper was now announced, he followed the cook, who
introduced him into the refectory, where it awaited him. 
D'Artagnan placed himself at the table, and began a hearty attack
upon his fowl.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It appears to me," said
D'Artagnan, biting with all his might at the tough fowl they had
served up to him, and which they had evidently forgotten to
fatten, - "it appears that I have done wrong in not seeking
service with that master yonder.  A powerful noble this
intendant, seemingly!  In good truth, we poor fellows know
nothing at the court, and the rays of the sun prevent our seeing
the large stars, which are also suns, at a little greater
distance from our earth, - that is all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                As D'Artagnan delighted,
both from pleasure and system, in making people talk about things
which interested him, he fenced in his best style with Master
Bazin, but it was pure loss of time; beyond the tiresome and
hyperbolical praises of monsieur le surintendant of the finances,
Bazin, who, on his side, was on his guard, afforded nothing but
platitudes to the curiosity of D'Artagnan, so that our musketeer,
in a tolerably bad humor, desired to go to bed as soon as he had
supped.  D'Artagnan was introduced by Bazin into a mean chamber,
in which there was a poor bed; but D'Artagnan was not fastidious
in that respect.  He had been told that Aramis had taken away the
key of his own private apartment, and as he knew Aramis was a
very particular man, and had generally many things to conceal in
his apartment, he had not been surprised.  He, therefore,
although it seemed comparatively even harder, attacked the bed as
bravely as he had done the fowl; and, as he had as good an
inclination to sleep as he had had to eat, he took scarcely
longer time to be snoring harmoniously than he had employed in
picking the last bones of the bird.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Since he was no longer in
the service of any one, D'Artagnan had promised himself to
indulge in sleeping as soundly as he had formerly slept lightly;
but with whatever good faith D'Artagnan had made himself this
promise, and whatever desire he might have to keep it
religiously, he was awakened in the middle of the night by a loud
noise of carriages, and servants on horseback.  A sudden
illumination flashed over the walls of his chamber; he jumped out
of bed and ran to the window in his shirt.  "Can the king be
coming this way?" he thought, rubbing his eyes; "in truth, such a
suite can only be attached to royalty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Vive le monsieur le
surintendant!</i>" cried, or rather vociferated, from a window on
the ground-floor, a voice which he recognized as Bazin's, who at
the same time waved a handkerchief with one hand, and held a
large candle in the other.  D'Artagnan then saw something like a
brilliant human form leaning out of the principal carriage; at
the same time loud bursts of laughter, caused, no doubt, by the
strange figure of Bazin, and issuing from the same carriage,
left, as it were, a train of joy upon the passage of the rapid
<i>cort&eacute;ge</i>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I might easily see it was
not the king," said D'Artagnan; "people don't laugh so heartily
when the king passes.  <i>Hol&agrave;</i> , Bazin!" cried he to
his neighbor, three-quarters of whose body still hung out of the
window, to follow the carriage with his eyes as long as he
could.  "What is all that about?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is M. Fouquet," said
Bazin, in a patronizing tone.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And all those people?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is the court of M.
Fouquet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, oh!" said D'Artagnan;
"what would M. de Mazarin say to that if he heard it?"  And he
returned to his bed, asking himself how Aramis always contrived
to be protected by the most powerful personages in the kingdom. 
"Is it that he has more luck than I, or that I am a greater fool
than he?  Bah!"  That was the concluding word by the aid of which
D'Artagnan, having become wise, now terminated every thought and
every period of his style.  Formerly he said, "<i>Mordioux!</i>"
which was a prick of the spur, but now he had become older, and
he murmured that philosophical "<i>Bah!</i>" which served as a
bridle to all the passions.</p>

D'Artagnan had perfectly convinced himself that the absence of
the Vicar-General d'Herblay was real, and that his friend was not
to be found at Melun or in its vicinity, he left Bazin without
regret, cast an ill-natured glance at the magnificent
Ch&acirc;teau de Vaux, which was beginning to shine with that
splendor which brought on its ruin, and, compressing his lips
like a man full of mistrust and suspicion, he put spurs to his
pied horse, saying, "Well, well!  I have still Pierrefonds left,
and there I shall find the best man and the best filled coffer. 
And that is all I want, for I have an idea of my own."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                We will spare our readers
the prosaic incidents of D'Artagnan's journey, which terminated
on the morning of the third day within sight of Pierrefonds. 
D'Artagnan came by the way of Nanteuil-le-Haudouin and
Cr&eacute;py.  At a distance he perceived the Castle of Louis of
Orl&eacute;ans, which, having become part of the crown domain,
was kept by an old <i>concierge</i>.  This was one of those
marvelous manors of the middle ages, with walls twenty feet in
thickness, and a hundred in height.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan rode slowly past
its walls, measured its towers with his eye and descended into
the valley.  From afar he looked down upon the ch&acirc;teau of
Porthos, situated on the shores of a small lake, and contiguous
to a magnificent forest.  It was the same place we have already
had the honor of describing to our readers; we shall therefore
satisfy ourselves with naming it.  The first thing D'Artagnan
perceived after the fine trees, the May sun gilding the sides of
the green hills, the long rows of feather-topped trees which
stretched out towards Compi&egrave;gne, was a large rolling box,
pushed forward by two servants and dragged by two others.  In
this box there was an enormous green-and-gold thing, which went
along the smiling glades of the park, thus dragged and pushed. 
This thing, at a distance, could not be distinguished, and
signified absolutely nothing; nearer, it was a hogshead muffled
in gold-bound green cloth; when close, it was a man, or rather a
<i>poussa</i>, the inferior extremity of whom, spreading over the
interior of the box, entirely filled it; when still closer, the
man was Mousqueton - Mousqueton, with gray hair and a face as red
as Punchinello's.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Pardieu!</i>" cried
D'Artagnan; "why, that's my dear Monsieur Mousqueton!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah!" cried the fat man -
"ah! what happiness! what joy!  There's M. d'Artagnan.  Stop, you
rascals!"  These last words were addressed to the lackeys who
pushed and dragged him.  The box stopped, and the four lackeys,
with a precision quite military, took off their laced hats and
ranged themselves behind it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, Monsieur d'Artagnan!"
said Mousqueton, "why can I not embrace your knees?  But I have
become impotent, as you see."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Dame!</i> my dear
Mousqueton, it is age."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, monsieur, it is not
age; it is infirmities - troubles."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Troubles! you, Mousqueton?"
said D'Artagnan, making the tour of the box; "are you out of your
mind, my dear friend?  Thank God! you are as hearty as a
three-hundred-year-old oak."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! but my legs, monsieur,
my legs!" groaned the faithful servant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What's the matter with your
legs?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, they will no longer
bear me!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, the ungrateful things! 
And yet you feed them well, Mousqueton, apparently."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Alas, yes!  They can
reproach me with nothing in that respect," said Mousqueton, with
a sigh; "I have always done what I could for my poor body; I am
not selfish."  And Mousqueton sighed afresh.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I wonder whether Mousqueton
wants to be a baron, too, as he sighs after that fashion?"
thought D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Mon Dieu</i>, monsieur!"
said Mousqueton, as if rousing himself from a painful reverie;
"how happy monseigneur will be that you have thought of him!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Kind Porthos!" cried
D'Artagnan, "I am anxious to embrace him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!" said Mousqueton, much
affected, "I shall certainly write to him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What!" cried D'Artagnan,
"you will write to him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This very day; I shall not
delay it an hour."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is he not here, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But is he near at hand? -
is he far off?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, can I tell, monsieur,
can I tell?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Mordioux!</i>" cried the
musketeer, stamping with his foot, "I am unfortunate.  Porthos is
such a stay-at-home!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, there is not a
more sedentary man that monseigneur, but - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But what?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "When a friend presses you -
"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A friend?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Doubtless - the worthy M.
d'Herblay."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What, has Aramis pressed
Porthos?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This is how the thing
happened, Monsieur d'Artagnan.  M. d'Herblay wrote to monseigneur
- "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Indeed!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A letter, monsieur, such a
pressing letter that it threw us all into a bustle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Tell me all about it, my
dear friend," said D'Artagnan; "but remove these people a little
further off first."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Mousqueton shouted, "Fall
back, you fellows," with such powerful lungs that the breath,
without the words, would have been sufficient to disperse the
four lackeys.  D'Artagnan seated himself on the shaft of the box
and opened his ears.  "Monsieur," said Mousqueton, "monseigneur,
then, received a letter from M. le Vicaire-G&eacute;n&eacute;ral
d'Herblay, eight or nine days ago; it was the day of the rustic
pleasures, yes, it must have been Wednesday."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What do you mean?" said
D'Artagnan.  "The day of rustic pleasures?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur; we have so
many pleasures to take in this delightful country, that we were
encumbered by them; so much so, that we have been forced to
regulate the distribution of them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How easily do I recognize
Porthos's love of order in that!  Now, that idea would never have
occurred to me; but then I am not encumbered with pleasures."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "We were, though," said
Mousqueton.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And how did you regulate
the matter, let me know?" said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is rather long,
monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Never mind, we have plenty
of time; and you speak so well, my dear Mousqueton, that it is
really a pleasure to hear you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is true," said
Mousqueton, with a sigh of satisfaction, which emanated evidently
from the justice which had been rendered him, "it is true I have
made great progress in the company of monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am waiting for the
distribution of the pleasures, Mousqueton, and with impatience. 
I want to know if I have arrived on a lucky day."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, Monsieur d'Artagnan,"
said Mousqueton in a melancholy tone, "since monseigneur's
departure all the pleasures have gone too!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, my dear Mousqueton,
refresh your memory."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "With what day shall I
begin?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eh, <i>pardieux!</i> begin
with Sunday; that is the Lord's day."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sunday, monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sunday pleasures are
religious: monseigneur goes to mass, makes the bread-offering,
and has discourses and instructions made to him by his
almoner-in-ordinary.  That is not very amusing, but we expect a
Carmelite from Paris who will do the duty of our almonry, and
who, we are assured, speaks very well, which will keep us awake,
whereas our present almoner always sends us to sleep.  These are
Sunday religious pleasures.  On Monday, worldly pleasures."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, ah!" said D'Artagnan,
"what do you mean by that?  Let us have a glimpse at your worldly
pleasures."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, on Monday we go
into the world; we pay and receive visits, we play on the lute,
we dance, we make verses, and burn a little incense in honor of
the ladies."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Peste!</i> that is the
height of gallantry," said the musketeer, who was obliged to call
to his aid all the strength of his facial muscles to suppress an
enormous inclination to laugh.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Tuesday, learned
pleasures."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good!" cried D'Artagnan. 
"What are they?  Detail them, my dear Mousqueton."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monseigneur has bought a
sphere or globe, which I shall show you; it fills all the
perimeter of the great tower, except a gallery which he has had
built over the sphere: there are little strings and brass wires
to which the sun and moon are hooked.  It all turns; and that is
very beautiful.  Monseigneur points out to me the seas and
distant countries.  We don't intend to visit them, but it is very
interesting."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Interesting! yes, that's
the word," repeated D'Artagnan.  "And Wednesday?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Rustic pleasures, as I have
had the honor to tell you, monsieur le chevalier.  We look over
monseigneur's sheep and goats; we make the shepherds dance to
pipes and reeds, as is written in a book monseigneur has in his
library, which is called 'Bergeries.'  The author died about a
month ago."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur Racan, perhaps,"
said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, that was his name - M.
Racan.  But that is not all: we angle in the little canal, after
which we dine, crowned with flowers.  That is Wednesday."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Peste!</i>" said
D'Artagnan; "you don't divide your pleasures badly.  And
Thursday? - what can be left for poor Thursday?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is not very unfortunate,
monsieur," said Mousqueton, smiling.  "Thursday, Olympian
pleasures.  Ah, monsieur, that is superb!  We get together all
monseigneur's young vassals, and we make them throw the disc,
wrestle, and run races.  Monseigneur can't run now, no more can
I; but monseigneur throws the disc as nobody else can throw it. 
And when he does deal a blow, oh, that proves a misfortune!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How so?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur, we were
obliged to renounce the cestus.  He cracked heads; he broke jaws
- beat in ribs.  It was charming sport; but nobody was willing to
play with him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then his wrist - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, monsieur, firmer than
ever.  Monseigneur gets a trifle weaker in his legs, - he
confesses that himself; but his strength has all taken refuge in
his arms, so that - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So that he can knock down
bullocks, as he used to formerly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, better than that
- he beats in walls.  Lately, after having supped with one of our
farmers - you know how popular and kind monseigneur is - after
supper, as a joke, he struck the wall a blow.  The wall crumbled
away beneath his hand, the roof fell in, and three men and an old
woman were stifled."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good God, Mousqueton!  And
your master?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, monseigneur, a little
skin was rubbed off his head.  We bathed the wounds with some
water which the monks gave us.  But there was nothing the matter
with his hand."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Nothing?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, nothing, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Deuce take the Olympic
pleasures!  They must cost your master too dear; for widows and
orphans - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "They all had pensions,
monsieur; a tenth of monseigneur's revenue was spent in that
way."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then pass on to Friday,"
said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Friday, noble and warlike
pleasures.  We hunt, we fence, we dress falcons and break
horses.  Then, Saturday is the day for intellectual pleasures: we
adorn our minds; we look at monseigneur's pictures and statues;
we write, even, and trace plans: and then we fire monseigneur's
cannon."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You draw plans, and fire
cannon?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, my friend," said
D'Artagnan, "M. du Vallon, in truth, possesses the most subtle
and amiable mind that I know.  But there is one kind of pleasure
you have forgotten, it appears to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What is that, monsieur?"
asked Mousqueton, with anxiety.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The material
pleasures."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Mousqueton colored.  "What
do you mean by that, monsieur?" said he, casting down his
eyes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I mean the table - good
wine - evenings occupied in passing the bottle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, monsieur, we don't
reckon those pleasures, - we practice them every day."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My brave Mousqueton,"
resumed D'Artagnan, "pardon me, but I was so absorbed in your
charming recital that I have forgotten the principal object of
our conversation, which was to learn what M. le
Vicaire-G&eacute;n&eacute;ral d'Herblay could have to write to
your master about."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is true, monsieur,"
said Mousqueton; "the pleasures have misled us.  Well, monsieur,
this is the whole affair."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am all attention,
Mousqueton."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "On Wednesday - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The day of the rustic
pleasures?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes - a letter arrived; he
received it from my hands.  I had recognized the writing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monseigneur read it and
cried out, "Quick, my horses! my arms!'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, good Lord! then it was
for some duel?" said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, monsieur, there were
only these words: 'Dear Porthos, set out, if you would wish to
arrive before the Equinox.  I expect you.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Mordioux!</i>" said
D'Artagnan, thoughtfully, "that was pressing, apparently."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I think so; therefore,"
continued Mousqueton, "monseigneur set out the very same day with
his secretary, in order to endeavor to arrive in time."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And did he arrive in
time?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I hope so.  Monseigneur,
who is hasty, as you know, monsieur, repeated incessantly,
'<i>Tonne Dieu!</i>  What can this mean?  The Equinox?  Never
mind, a fellow must be well mounted to arrive before I do.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you think Porthos will
have arrived first, do you?" asked D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am sure of it.  This
Equinox, however rich he may be, has certainly no horses so good
as monseigneur's."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan repressed his
inclination to laugh, because the brevity of Aramis's letter gave
rise to reflection.  He followed Mousqueton, or rather
Mousqueton's chariot, to the castle.  He sat down to a sumptuous
table, of which they did him the honors as to a king.  But he
could draw nothing from Mousqueton, - the faithful servant seemed
to shed tears at will, but that was all.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan, after a night
passed in an excellent bed, reflected much upon the meaning of
Aramis's letter; puzzled himself as to the relation of the
Equinox with the affairs of Porthos; and being unable to make
anything out unless it concerned some <i>amour</i> of the
bishop's, for which it was necessary that the days and nights
should be equal, D'Artagnan left Pierrefonds as he had left
Melun, as he had left the ch&acirc;teau of the Comte de la
F&egrave;re.  It was not, however, without a melancholy, which
might in good sooth pass for one of the most dismal of
D'Artagnan's moods.  His head cast down, his eyes fixed, he
suffered his legs to hang on each side of his horse, and said to
himself, in that vague sort of reverie which ascends sometimes to
the sublimest eloquence:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No more friends! no more
future! no more anything!  My energies are broken like the bonds
of our ancient friendship.  Oh, old age is coming, cold and
inexorable; it envelopes in its funeral cr&ecirc;pe all that was
brilliant, all that was embalming in my youth; then it throws
that sweet burthen on its shoulders and carries it away with the
rest into the fathomless gulf of death."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                A shudder crept through the
heart of the Gascon, so brave and so strong against all the
misfortunes of life; and during some moments the clouds appeared
black to him, the earth slippery and full of pits as that of
cemeteries.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Whither am I going?" said
he to himself.  "What am I going to do!  Alone, quite alone -
without family, without friends!  Bah!" cried he all at once. 
And he clapped spurs to his horse, who, having found nothing
melancholy in the heavy oats of Pierrefonds, profited by this
permission to show his gayety in a gallop which absorbed two
leagues.  "To Paris!" said D'Artagnan to himself.  And on the
morrow he alighted in Paris.  He had devoted ten days to this
journey.</p>

'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>T</span>he lieutenant
dismounted before a shop in the Rue des Lombards, at the sign of
the Pilon d'Or.  A man of good appearance, wearing a white apron,
and stroking his gray mustache with a large hand, uttered a cry
of joy on perceiving the pied horse.  "Monsieur le chevalier,"
said he, "ah, is that you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Bon jour</i>, Planchet,"
replied D'Artagnan, stooping to enter the shop.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Quick, somebody," cried
Planchet, "to look after Monsieur d'Artagnan's horse, - somebody
to get ready his room, - somebody to prepare his supper."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thanks, Planchet. 
Good-day, my children!" said D'Artagnan to the eager boys.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Allow me to send off this
coffee, this treacle, and these raisins," said Planchet; "they
are for the store-room of monsieur le surintendant."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Send them off, send them
off!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is only the affair of
a moment, then we shall sup."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Arrange it that we may sup
alone; I want to speak to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Planchet looked at his old
master in a significant manner.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, don't be uneasy, it is
nothing unpleasant," said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So much the better - so
much the better!"  And Planchet breathed freely again, whilst
D'Artagnan seated himself quietly down in the shop, upon a bale
of corks, and made a survey of the premises.  The shop was well
stocked; there was a mingled perfume of ginger, cinnamon, and
ground pepper, which made D'Artagnan sneeze.  The shop-boy, proud
of being in company with so renowned a warrior, of a lieutenant
of musketeers, who approached the person of the king, began to
work with an enthusiasm which was something like delirium, and to
serve the customers with a disdainful haste that was noticed by
several.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Planchet put away his money,
and made up his accounts, amidst civilities addressed to his
former master.  Planchet had with his equals the short speech and
haughty familiarity of the rich shopkeeper who serves everybody
and waits for nobody.  D'Artagnan observed this habit with a
pleasure which we shall analyze presently.  He saw night come on
by degrees, and at length Planchet conducted him to a chamber on
the first story, where, amidst bales and chests, a table very
nicely set out awaited the two guests.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan took advantage of
a moment's pause to examine the countenance of Planchet, whom he
had not seen for a year.  The shrewd Planchet had acquired a
slight protuberance in front, but his countenance was not
puffed.  His keen eye still played with facility in its deep-sunk
orbit; and fat, which levels all the characteristic saliences of
the human face, had not yet touched either his high cheek-bones,
the sign of cunning and cupidity, or his pointed chin, the sign
of acuteness and perseverance.  Planchet reigned with as much
majesty in his dining-room as in his shop.  He set before his
master a frugal, but perfectly Parisian repast: roast meat,
cooked at the baker's, with vegetables, salad, and a dessert
borrowed from the shop itself.  D'Artagnan was pleased that the
grocer had drawn from behind the fagots a bottle of that Anjou
wine which during all his life had been D'Artagnan's favorite
wine.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Formerly, monsieur," said
Planchet, with a smile full of <i>bonhomie</i>, "it was I who
drank your wine; now you do me the honor to drink mine."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And, thank God, friend
Planchet, I shall drink it for a long time to come, I hope; for
at present I am free."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Free?  You have a leave of
absence, monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Unlimited."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are leaving the
service?" said Planchet, stupefied.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, I am resting."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And the king?" cried
Planchet, who could not suppose it possible that the king could
do without the services of such a man as D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The king will try his
fortune elsewhere.  But we have supped well, you are disposed to
enjoy yourself; you invite me to confide in you.  Open your ears,
then."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "They are open."  And
Planchet, with a laugh more frank than cunning, opened a bottle
of white wine.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Leave me my reason, at
least."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, as to you losing your
head - you, monsieur!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Now my head is my own, and
I mean to take better care of it than ever.  In the first place
we shall talk business.  How fares our money-box?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Wonderfully well,
monsieur.  The twenty thousand livres I had of you are still
employed in my trade, in which they bring me nine per cent.  I
give you seven, so I gain two by you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you are still
satisfied?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Delighted.  Have you
brought me any more?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Better than that.  But do
you want any?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! not at all.  Every one
is willing to trust me now.  I am extending my business."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That was your
intention."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I play the banker a
little.  I buy goods of my needy brethren; I lend money to those
who are not ready for their payments."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Without usury?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! monsieur, in the course
of the last week I have had two meetings on the boulevards, on
account of the word you have just pronounced."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You shall see: it concerned
a loan.  The borrower gives me in pledge some raw sugars, on
condition that I should sell if repayment were not made within a
fixed period.  I lend a thousand livres.  He does not pay me, and
I sell the sugars for thirteen hundred livres.  He learns this
and claims a hundred crowns.  <i>Ma foi!</i>  I refused,
pretending that I could not sell them for more than nine hundred
livres.  He accused me of usury.  I begged him to repeat that
word to me behind the boulevards.  He was an old guard, and he
came: and I passed your sword through his left thigh."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Tu dieu!</i> what a
pretty sort of banker you make!" said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "For above thirteen per cent
I fight," replied Planchet; "that is my character."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Take only twelve," said
D'Artagnan, "and call the rest premium and brokerage."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are right, monsieur;
but to your business."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah!  Planchet, it is very
long and very hard to speak."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do speak it,
nevertheless."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan twisted his
mustache like a man embarrassed with the confidence he is about
to make and mistrustful of his confidant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is it an investment?" asked
Planchet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "At good profit?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A capital profit, - four
hundred per cent, Planchet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Planchet gave such a blow
with his fist upon the table, that the bottles bounded as if they
had been frightened.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good heavens! is that
possible?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I think it will be more,"
replied D'Artagnan coolly; "but I like to lay it at the
lowest!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The devil!" said Planchet,
drawing nearer.  "Why, monsieur, that is magnificent!  Can one
put much money in it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Twenty thousand livres
each, Planchet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, that is all you have,
monsieur.  For how long a time?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "For a month."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And that will give us -
"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Fifty thousand livres each,
profit."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is monstrous!  It is
worth while to fight for such interest as that!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In fact, I believe it will
be necessary to fight not a little," said D'Artagnan, with the
same tranquillity; "but this time there are two of us, Planchet,
and I shall take all the blows to myself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! monsieur, I will not
allow that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Planchet, you cannot be
concerned in it; you would be obliged to leave your business and
your family."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The affair is not in Paris,
then."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Abroad?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In England."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A speculative country, that
is true," said Planchet, - "a country that I know well.  What
sort of an affair, monsieur, without too much curiosity?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Planchet, it is a
restoration."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Of monuments?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, of monuments; we shall
restore Whitehall."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is important.  And in
a month, you think?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I shall undertake it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That concerns you,
monsieur, and when once you are engaged - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, that concerns me.  I
know what I am about; nevertheless, I will freely consult with
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You do me great honor; but
I know very little about architecture."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Planchet, you are wrong;
you are an excellent architect, quite as good as I am, for the
case in question."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thanks, monsieur.  But your
old friends of the musketeers?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have been, I confess,
tempted to speak of the thing to those gentlemen, but they are
all absent from their houses.  It is vexatious, for I know none
more bold or able."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! then it appears there
will be an opposition, and the enterprise will be disputed?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, yes, Planchet,
yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I burn to know the details,
monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Here they are, Planchet -
close all the doors tight."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur."  And
Planchet double-locked them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is well; now draw
near."  Planchet obeyed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And open the window,
because the noise of the passers-by and the carts will deafen all
who might hear us."  Planchet opened the window as desired, and
the gust of tumult which filled the chamber with cries, wheels,
barkings, and steps deafened D'Artagnan himself, as he had
wished.  He then swallowed a glass of white wine, and began in
these terms: "Planchet, I have an idea."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! monsieur, I recognize
you so well in that!" replied Planchet, panting with emotion.</p>

moment's silence, in which D'Artagnan appeared to be collecting,
not one idea, but all his ideas - "It cannot be, my dear
Planchet," said he, "that you have not heard of his majesty
Charles I. of England?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Alas! yes, monsieur, since
you left France in order to assist him, and that, in spite of
that assistance, he fell, and was near dragging you down in his
fall."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Exactly so; I see you have
a good memory, Planchet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Peste!</i> the
astonishing thing would be, if I could have lost that memory,
however bad it might have been.  When one has heard Grimaud, who,
you know, is not given to talking, relate how the head of King
Charles fell, how you sailed the half of a night in a scuttled
vessel, and saw floating on the water that good M. Mordaunt with
a certain gold-hafted dagger buried in his breast, one is not
very likely to forget such things."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And yet there are people
who forget them, Planchet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, such as have not seen
them, or have not heard Grimaud relate them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, it is all the better
that you recollect all that; I shall only have to remind you of
one thing, and that is that Charles I. had a son."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Without contradicting you,
monsieur, he had two," said Planchet; "for I saw the second one
in Paris, M. le Duke of York, one day, as he was going to the
Palais Royal, and I was told that he was not the eldest son of
Charles I.  As to the eldest, I have the honor of knowing him by
name, but not personally."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is exactly the point,
Planchet, we must come to: it is to this eldest son, formerly
called the Prince of Wales, and who is now styled Charles II.,
king of England."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A king without a kingdom,
monsieur," replied Planchet, sententiously.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, Planchet, and you may
add an unfortunate prince, more unfortunate than the poorest man
of the people lost in the worst quarter of Paris."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Planchet made a gesture full
of that sort of compassion which we grant to strangers with whom
we think we can never possibly find ourselves in contact. 
Besides, he did not see in this politico-sentimental operation
any sign of the commercial idea of M. d'Artagnan, and it was in
this idea that D'Artagnan, who was, from habit, pretty well
acquainted with men and things, had principally interested
Planchet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am come to our business. 
This young Prince of Wales, a king without a kingdom, as you have
so well said, Planchet, has interested me.  I, D'Artagnan, have
seen him begging assistance of Mazarin, who is a miser, and the
aid of Louis, who is a child, and it appeared to me, who am
acquainted with such things, that in the intelligent eye of the
fallen king, in the nobility of his whole person, a nobility
apparent above all his miseries, I could discern the stuff of a
man and the heart of a king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Planchet tacitly approved of
all this; but it did not at all, in his eyes at least, throw any
light upon D'Artagnan's idea.  The latter continued: "This, then,
is the reasoning which I made with myself.  Listen attentively,
Planchet, for we are coming to the conclusion."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am listening."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Kings are not so thickly
sown upon the earth, that people can find them whenever they want
them.  Now, this king without a kingdom is, in my opinion, a
grain of seed which will blossom in some season or other,
provided a skillful, discreet, and vigorous hand sow it duly and
truly, selecting soil, sky, and time."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Planchet still approved by a
nod of his head, which showed that he did not perfectly
comprehend all that was said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "'Poor little seed of a
king,' said I to myself, and really I was affected, Planchet,
which leads me to think I am entering upon a foolish business. 
And that is why I wished to consult you, my friend."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Planchet colored with
pleasure and pride.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "'Poor little seed of a
king!  I will pick you up and cast you into good ground.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good God!" said Planchet,
looking earnestly at his old master, as if in doubt as to the
state of his reason.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, what is it?" said
D'Artagnan; "who hurts you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Me! nothing, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You said, 'Good God!'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Did I?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am sure you did.  Can you
already understand?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I confess, M. d'Artagnan,
that I am afraid - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To understand?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To understand that I wish
to replace upon his throne this King Charles II., who has no
throne?  Is that it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Planchet made a prodigious
bound in his chair.  "Ah, ah!" said he, in evident terror, "that
is what you call a restoration!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, Planchet; is it not
the proper term for it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, no doubt, no doubt! 
But have you reflected seriously?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Upon what?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Upon what is going on
yonder."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Where?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In England."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And what is that?  Let us
see, Planchet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In the first place,
monsieur, I ask you pardon for meddling in these things, which
have nothing to do with my trade; but since it is an affair that
you propose to me - for you are proposing an affair, are you not?
- "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A superb one,
Planchet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But as it is business you
propose to me, I have the right to discuss it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Discuss it, Planchet; out
of discussion is born light."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, then, since I have
monsieur's permission, I will tell him that there is yonder, in
the first place, the parliament."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, next?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And then the army."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good!  Do you see anything
else?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, then the nation."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is that all?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The nation which consented
to the overthrow and death of the late king, the father of this
one, and which will not be willing to belie its acts."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Planchet," said D'Artagnan,
"you argue like a cheese!  The nation - the nation is tired of
these gentlemen who give themselves such barbarous names, and who
sing songs to it.  Chanting for chanting, my dear Planchet; I
have remarked that nations prefer singing a merry chant to the
plain chant.  Remember the Fronde; what did they sing in those
times?  Well, those were good times."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Not too good, not too
good!  I was near being hung in those times."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, but you were
not."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you laid the
foundations of your fortune in the midst of all those songs?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is true."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then you have nothing to
say against them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, I return, then, to
the army and parliament."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I say that I borrow twenty
thousand livres of M. Planchet, and that I put twenty thousand
livres of my own to it; and with these forty thousand livres I
raise an army."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Planchet clasped his hands;
he saw that D'Artagnan was in earnest, and, in good truth, he
believed his master had lost his senses.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "An army! - ah, monsieur,"
said he, with his most agreeable smile, for fear of irritating
the madman, and rendering him furious, - "an army! - how
many?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Of forty men," said
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Forty against forty
thousand! that is not enough.  I know very well that you, M.
d'Artagnan, alone, are equal to a thousand men; but where are we
to find thirty-nine men equal to you?  Or, if we could find them,
who would furnish you with money to pay them?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Not bad, Planchet.  Ah, the
devil! you play the courtier."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, monsieur, I speak what
I think, and that is exactly why I say that, in the first pitched
battle you fight with your forty men, I am very much afraid -
"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Therefore I shall fight no
pitched battles, my dear Planchet," said the Gascon, laughing. 
"We have very fine examples in antiquity of skillful retreats and
marches, which consisted in avoiding the enemy instead of
attacking them.  You should know that, Planchet, you who
commanded the Parisians the day on which they ought to have
fought against the musketeers, and who so well calculated marches
and countermarches, that you never left the Palais Royal."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Planchet could not help
laughing.  "It is plain," replied he, "that if your forty men
conceal themselves, and are not unskillful, they may hope not to
be beaten: but you propose obtaining some result, do you
not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No doubt.  This, then, in
my opinion, is the plan to be proceeded upon in order quickly to
replace his majesty Charles II. on his throne."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good!" said Planchet,
increasing his attention; "let us see your plan.  But in the
first place it seems to me we are forgetting something."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What is that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "We have set aside the
nation, which prefers singing merry songs to psalms, and the
army, which we will not fight; but the parliament remains, and
that seldom sings."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Nor does it fight.  How is
it, Planchet, that an intelligent man like yourself should take
any heed of a set of brawlers who call themselves Rumps and
Barebones?  The parliament does not trouble me at all,
Planchet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "As soon as it ceases to
trouble you, monsieur, let us pass on."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, and arrive at the
result.  You remember Cromwell, Planchet?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have heard a great deal
of talk about him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He was a rough
soldier."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And a terrible eater,
moreover."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What do you mean by
that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, at one gulp he
swallowed all England."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, Planchet, the evening
before the day on which he swallowed England, if any one had
swallowed M. Cromwell?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, monsieur, it is one of
the axioms of mathematics that the container must be greater than
the contained."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very well!  That is our
affair, Planchet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But M. Cromwell is dead,
and his container is now the tomb."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My dear Planchet, I see
with pleasure that you have not only become a mathematician, but
a philosopher."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, in my grocery
business I use much printed paper, and that instructs me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bravo!  You know then, in
that case - for you have not learnt mathematics and philosophy
without a little history - that after this Cromwell so great,
there came one who was very little."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes; he was named Richard,
and he as done as you have, M. d'Artagnan - he has tendered his
resignation."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very well said - very
well!  After the great man who is dead, after the little one who
tendered his resignation, there came a third.  This one is named
Monk; he is an able general, considering he has never fought a
battle; he is a skillful diplomatist, considering that he never
speaks in public, and that having to say 'good-day' to a man, he
meditates twelve hours, and ends by saying 'good night;' which
makes people exclaim '<i>miracle!</i>' seeing that it falls out
correctly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is rather strong,"
said Planchet; "but I know another political man who resembles
him very much."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "M. Mazarin you mean?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Himself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are right, Planchet;
only M. Mazarin does not aspire to the throne of France; and that
changes everything.  Do you see?  Well, this M. Monk, who has
England ready-roasted in his plate, and who is already opening
his mouth to swallow it - this M. Monk, who says to the people of
Charles II., and to Charles II. himself, '<i>Nescio vos</i>' -
"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I don't understand
English," said Planchet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, but I understand it,"
said D'Artagnan.  "'<i>Nescio vos</i>' means 'I do not know
you.'  This M. Monk, the most important man in England, when he
shall have swallowed it - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well?" asked Planchet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, my friend, I shall go
over yonder, and with my forty men I shall carry him off, pack
him up, and bring him into France, where two modes of proceeding
present themselves to my dazzled eyes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! and to mine too," cried
Planchet, transported with enthusiasm.  "We will put him in a
cage and show him for money."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, Planchet, that is a
third plan, of which I had not thought."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do you think it a good
one?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, certainly, but I think
mine better."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Let us see yours,
then."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In the first place, I shall
set a ransom on him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Of how much?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Peste!</i> a fellow like
that must be well worth a hundred thousand crowns."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, yes!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You see, then - in the
first place, a ransom of a hundred thousand crowns."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Or else - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Or else, what is much
better, I deliver him up to King Charles, who, having no longer
either a general or an army to fear, nor a diplomatist to trick
him, will restore himself, and when once restored, will pay down
to me the hundred thousand crowns in question.  That is the idea
I have formed; what do you say to it, Planchet?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Magnificent, monsieur!"
cried Planchet, trembling with emotion.  "How did you conceive
that idea?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It came to me one morning
on the banks of the Loire, whilst our beloved king, Louis XIV.,
was pretending to weep upon the hand of Mademoiselle de
Mancini."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, I declare the
idea is sublime.  But - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! is there a
<i>but?</i>"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Permit me!  But this is a
little like the skin of that fine bear - you know - that they
were about to sell, but which it was necessary to take from the
back of the living bear.  Now, to take M. Monk, there will be a
bit of a scuffle, I should think."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No doubt; but as I shall
raise an army to - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, yes - I understand,
<i>parbleu!</i> - a <i>coup-de-main</i>.  Yes, then, monsieur,
you will triumph, for  no one equals you in such sorts of
encounters."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I certainly am lucky in
them," said D'Artagnan, with a proud simplicity.  "You know that
if for this affair I had my dear Athos, my brave Porthos, and my
cunning Aramis, the business would be settled; but they are all
lost, as it appears, and nobody knows where to find them.  I will
do it, then, alone.  Now, do you find the business good, and the
investment advantageous?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Too much so - too much
so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How can that be?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Because fine things never
reach the expected point."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This is infallible,
Planchet, and the proof is that I undertake it.  It will be for
you a tolerably pretty gain, and for me a very interesting
stroke.  It will be said, 'Such was the old age of M.
d'Artagnan,' and I shall hold a place in tales and even in
history itself, Planchet.  I am greedy of honor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," cried Planchet,
"when I think that it is here, in my home, in the midst of my
sugar, my prunes, and my cinnamon, that this gigantic project is
ripened, my shop seems a palace to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Beware, beware, Planchet! 
If the least report of this escapes, there is the Bastile for
both of us.  Beware, my friend, for this is a plot we are
hatching.  M. Monk is the ally of M. Mazarin - beware!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, when a man has
had the honor to belong to you, he knows nothing of fear; and
when he has had the advantage of being bound up in interests with
you, he holds his tongue."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very well; that is more
your affair than mine, seeing that in a week I shall be in
England."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Depart, monsieur, depart -
the sooner the better."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is the money, then,
ready?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It will be to-morrow;
to-morrow you shall receive it from my own hands.  Will you have
gold or silver?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Gold; that is most
convenient.  But how are we going to arrange this?  Let us
see."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, good Lord! in the
simplest way possible.  You shall give me a receipt, that is
all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, no," said D'Artagnan,
warmly; "we must preserve order in all things."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is likewise my
opinion; but with you, M. d'Artagnan - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And if I should die yonder
- if I should be killed by a musket-ball - if I should burst from
drinking beer?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, I beg you to
believe that in that case I should be so much afflicted at your
death, that I should not think about the money."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thank you, Planchet; but no
matter.  We shall, like two lawyers' clerks, draw up together an
agreement, a sort of act, which may be called a deed of
company."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Willingly, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I know it is difficult to
draw such a thing up, but we can try."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Let us try, then."  And
Planchet went in search of pens, ink, and paper.  D'Artagnan took
the pen and wrote: - "Between Messire d'Artagnan, ex-lieutenant
of the king's musketeers, at present residing in the Rue
Tiquetonne, Hotel de la Chevrette; and the Sieur Planchet,
grocer, residing in the Rue des Lombards, at the sign of the
Pilon d'Or, it has been agreed as follows: - A company, with a
capital of forty thousand livres, and formed for the purpose of
carrying out an idea conceived by M. d'Artagnan, and the said
Planchet approving of it in all points, will place twenty
thousand livres in the hands of M. d'Artagnan.  He will require
neither repayment nor interest before the return of M. d'Artagnan
from a journey he is about to take into England.  On his part, M.
d'Artagnan undertakes it to find twenty thousand livres, which he
will join to the twenty thousand already laid down by the Sieur
Planchet.  He will employ the said sum of forty thousand livres
according to his judgment in an undertaking which is described
below.  On the day when M. d'Artagnan shall have re-established,
by whatever means, his majesty King Charles II. upon the throne
of England, he will pay into the hands of M. Planchet the sum of
- "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The sum of a hundred and
fifty thousand livres," said Planchet, innocently, perceiving
that D'Artagnan hesitated.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, the devil, no!" said
D'Artagnan, "the division cannot be made by half; that would not
be just."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And yet, monsieur, we each
lay down half," objected Planchet, timidly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes; but listen to this
clause, my dear Planchet, and if you do not find if equitable in
every respect when it is written, well, we can scratch it out
again: - 'Nevertheless, as M. d'Artagnan brings to the
association, besides his capital of twenty thousand livres, his
time, his idea, his industry, and his skin, - things which he
appreciates strongly, particularly the last, - M. d'Artagnan will
keep, of the three hundred thousand livres, two hundred thousand
livres for himself, which will make his share two-thirds."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very well," said
Planchet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is it just?" asked
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Perfectly just,
monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you will be contented
with a hundred thousand livres?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Peste!</i> I think so. 
A hundred thousand for twenty thousand!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And in a month,
understand."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How, in a month?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, I only ask one
month."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," said Planchet,
generously, "I give you six weeks."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thank you," replied the
musketeer, politely; after which the two partners reperused their
deed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is perfect, monsieur,"
said Planchet; "and the late M. Coquenard, the first husband of
Madame la Baronne du Vallon, could not have done it better."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do you find it so?  Let us
sign it then."  And both affixed their signatures.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In this fashion," said
D'Artagnan, "I shall be under obligations to no one."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But I shall be under
obligations to you," said Planchet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No; for whatever store I
set by it, Planchet, I may lose my skin yonder, and you will lose
all.  <i>A propos - peste! -</i> that makes me think of the
principal, an indispensable clause.  I shall write it: - 'In case
of M. d'Artagnan dying in this enterprise, liquidation will be
considered made, and the Sieur Planchet will give quittance from
that moment to the shade of Messire d'Artagnan for the twenty
thousand livres paid by him into the hands of the said
company.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This last clause made
Planchet knit his brows a little, but when he saw the brilliant
eye, the muscular hand, the supple and strong back of his
associate, he regained his courage, and, without regret, he at
once added another stroke to his signature.  D'Artagnan did the
same.  Thus was drawn the first known company contract; perhaps
such things have been abused a little since, both in form and
principle.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Now," said Planchet,
pouring out the last glass of Anjou wine for D'Artagnan, - "now
go to sleep, my dear master."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No," replied D'Artagnan;
"for the most difficult part now remains to be done, and I will
think over that difficult part."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bah!" said Planchet; "I
have such great confidence in you, M. d'Artagnan, that I would
not give my hundred thousand livres for ninety thousand livres
down."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And devil take me if I
don't think you are right!"  Upon which D'Artagnan took a candle
and went up to his bedroom.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>D</span>'Artagnan
reflected to such good purpose during the night that his plan was
settled by morning.  "This is it," said he, sitting up in bed,
supporting his elbow on his knee, and his chin in his hand; -
"this is it.  I shall seek out forty steady, firm men, recruited
among people a little compromised, but having habits of
discipline.  I shall promise them five hundred livres for a month
if they return; nothing if they do not return, or half for their
kindred.  As to food and lodging, that concerns the English, who
have cattle in their pastures, bacon in their bacon-racks, fowls
in their poultry-yards, and corn in their barns.  I will present
myself to General Monk with my little body of troops.  He will
receive me.  I shall win his confidence, and take advantage of
it, as soon as possible."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                But without going further,
D'Artagnan shook his head and interrupted himself.  "No," said
he; "I should not dare to relate this to Athos; the way is
therefore not honorable.  I must use violence," continued he, -
"very certainly I must, but without compromising my loyalty. 
With forty men I will traverse the country as a partisan.  But if
I fall in with, not forty thousand English, as Planchet said, but
purely and simply with four hundred, I shall be beaten. 
Supposing that among my forty warriors there should be found at
least ten stupid ones - ten who will allow themselves to be
killed one after the other, from mere folly?  No; it is, in fact,
impossible to find forty men to be depended upon - they do not
exist.  I must learn how to be contented with thirty.  With ten
men less I should have the right of avoiding any armed encounter,
on account of the small number of my people; and if the encounter
should take place, my chance is better with thirty men than
forty.  Besides, I should save five thousand francs; that is to
say, the eighth of my capital; that is worth the trial.  This
being so, I should have thirty men.  I shall divide them into
three bands, - we will spread ourselves about over the country,
with an injunction to reunite at a given moment; in this fashion,
ten by ten, we should excite no suspicion - we should pass
unperceived.  Yes, yes, thirty - that is a magic number.  There
are three tens - three, that divine number!  And then, truly, a
company of thirty men, when all together, will look rather
imposing.  Ah! stupid wretch that I am!" continued D'Artagnan, "I
want thirty horses.  That is ruinous.  Where the devil was my
head when I forgot the horses?  We cannot, however, think of
striking such a blow without horses.  Well, so be it, that
sacrifice must be made; we can get the horses in the country -
they are not bad, besides.  But I forgot - <i>peste!</i>  Three
bands - that necessitates three leaders; there is the
difficulty.  Of the three commanders I have already one - that is
myself; - yes, but the two others will of themselves cost almost
as much money as all the rest of the troop.  No; positively I
must have but one lieutenant.  In that case, then, I should
reduce my troop to twenty men.  I know very well that twenty men
is but very little; but since with thirty I was determined not to
seek to come to blows, I should do so more carefully still with
twenty.  Twenty - that is a round number; that, besides, reduces
the number of the horses by ten, which is a consideration; and
then, with a good lieutenant - <i>Mordioux!</i> what things
patience and calculation are!  Was I not going to embark with
forty men, and I have now reduced them to twenty for an equal
success?  Ten thousand livres saved at one stroke, and more
safety; that is well!  Now, then, let us see; we have nothing to
do but to find this lieutenant - let him be found, then; and
after -  That is not so easy; he must be brave and good, a second
myself.  Yes, but a lieutenant must have my secret, and as that
secret is worth a million, and I shall only pay my man a thousand
livres, fifteen hundred at the most, my man will sell the secret
to Monk.  <i>Mordioux!</i> no lieutenant.  Besides, this man,
were he as mute as a disciple of Pythagoras, - this man would be
sure to have in the troop some favorite soldier, whom he would
make his sergeant; the sergeant would penetrate the secret of the
lieutenant, in case the latter should be honest and unwilling to
sell it.  Then the sergeant, less honest and less ambitious, will
give up the whole for fifty thousand livres.  Come, come! that is
impossible.  The lieutenant is impossible.  But then I must have
no fractions; I cannot divide my troop in two, and act upon two
points, at once, without another self, who -  But what is the use
of acting upon two points, as we have only one man to take?  What
can be the use of weakening a corps by placing the right here,
and the left there?  A single corps - <i>Mordioux!</i> a single
one, and that commanded by D'Artagnan.  Very well.  But twenty
men marching in one band are suspected by everybody; twenty
horsemen must not be seen marching together, or a company will be
detached against them and the password will be required; the
which company, upon seeing them embarrassed to give it, would
shoot M. d'Artagnan and his men like so many rabbits.  I reduce
myself then to ten men; in this fashion I shall act simply and
with unity; I shall be forced to be prudent, which is half the
success in an affair of the kind I am undertaking; a greater
number might, perhaps, have drawn me into some folly.  Ten horses
are not many, either, to buy or take.  A capital idea; what
tranquillity it infuses into my mind! no more suspicions - no
passwords - no more dangers!  Ten men, they are valets or
clerks.  Ten men, leading ten horses laden with merchandise of
whatever kind, are tolerated, well received everywhere.  Ten men
travel on account of the house of Planchet &amp; Co., of France,
- nothing can be said against that.  These ten men, clothed like
manufacturers, have a good cutlass or a good musket at their
saddle-bow, and a good pistol in the holster.  They never allow
themselves to be uneasy, because they have no evil designs.  They
are, perhaps, in truth, a little disposed to be smugglers, but
what harm is in that?  Smuggling is not, like polygamy, a hanging
offense.  The worst that can happen to us is the confiscation of
our merchandise.  Our merchandise confiscated - a fine affair
that!  Come, come! it is a superb plan.  Ten men only - ten men,
whom I will engage for my service; ten men who shall be as
resolute as forty, who would cost me four times as much, and to
whom, for greater security, I will never open my mouth as to my
designs, and to whom I shall only say 'My friends, there is a
blow to be struck.'  Things being after this fashion, Satan will
be very malicious if he plays me one of his tricks.  Fifteen
thousand livres saved - that's superb - out of twenty!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Thus fortified by his
laborious calculations, D'Artagnan stopped at this plan, and
determined to change nothing in it.  He had already on a list
furnished by his inexhaustible memory, ten men illustrious
amongst the seekers of adventure, ill-treated by fortune, and not
on good terms with justice.  Upon this D'Artagnan rose, and
instantly set off on the search, telling Planchet not to expect
him to breakfast, and perhaps not to dinner.  A day and a half
spent in rummaging amongst certain dens of Paris sufficed for his
recruiting; and, without allowing his adventurers to communicate
with each other, he had picked up and got together, in less than
thirty hours, a charming collection of ill-looking faces,
speaking a French less pure than the English they were about to
attempt.  These men were, for the most part, guards, whose merit
D'Artagnan had had an opportunity of appreciating in various
encounters, whom drunkenness, unlucky sword-thrusts, unexpected
winnings at play, or the economical reforms of Mazarin, had
forced to seek shade and solitude, those two great consolers of
irritated and chafing spirits.  They bore upon their countenances
and in their vestments the traces of the heartaches they had
undergone.  Some had their visages scarred, - all had their
clothes in rags.  D'Artagnan comforted the most needy of these
brotherly miseries by a prudent distribution of the crowns of the
company; then, having taken care that these crowns should be
employed in the physical improvement of the troop, he appointed a
trysting place in the north of France, between Bergues and Saint
Omer.  Six days were allowed as the utmost term, and D'Artagnan
was sufficiently acquainted with the good-will, the good-humor,
and the relative probity of these illustrious recruits, to be
certain that not one of them would fail in his appointment. 
These orders given, this rendezvous fixed, he went to bid
farewell to Planchet, who asked news of his army.  D'Artagnan did
not think it proper to inform him of the reduction he had made in
his <i>personnel</i>.  He feared that the confidence of his
associate would be abated by such an avowal.  Planchet was
delighted to learn that the army was levied, and that he
(Planchet) found himself a kind of half king, who from his
throne-counter kept in pay a body of troops destined to make war
against perfidious Albion, that enemy of all true French hearts. 
Planchet paid down in double louis, twenty thousand livres to
D'Artagnan, on the part of himself (Planchet), and twenty
thousand livres, still in double louis, in account with
D'Artagnan.  D'Artagnan placed each of the twenty thousand francs
in a bag, and weighing a bag in each hand, - "This money is very
embarrassing, my dear Planchet," said he.  "Do you know this
weighs thirty pounds?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bah! your horse will carry
that like a feather."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan shook his head. 
"Don't tell me such things, Planchet: a horse overloaded with
thirty pounds, in addition to the rider and his portmanteau,
cannot cross a river so easily - cannot leap over a wall or ditch
so lightly; and the horse failing, the horseman fails.  It is
true that you, Planchet, who have served in the infantry, may not
be aware of all that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then what is to be done,
monsieur?" said Planchet, greatly embarrassed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Listen to me," said
D'Artagnan.  "I will pay my army on its return home.  Keep my
half of twenty thousand livres, which you can use during that
time."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And my half?" said
Planchet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I shall take that with
me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your confidence does me
honor," said Planchet: "but supposing you should not return?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is possible, though
not very probable.  Then, Planchet, in case I should not return -
give me a pen; I will make my will."  D'Artagnan took a pen and
some paper, and wrote upon a plain sheet, - "I, D'Artagnan,
possess twenty thousand livres, laid up cent per cent during
thirty years that I have been in the service of his majesty the
king of France.  I leave five thousand to Athos, five thousand to
Porthos, and five thousand to Aramis, that they may give the said
sums in my name and their own to my young friend Raoul, Vicomte
de Bragelonne.  I give the remaining five thousand to Planchet,
that he may distribute the fifteen thousand with less regret
among my friends.  With which purpose I sign these presents. -
D'ARTAGNAN."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Planchet appeared very
curious to know what D'Artagnan had written.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Here," said the musketeer,
"read it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                On reading the last lines
the tears came into Planchet's eyes.  "You think, then, that I
would not have given the money without that?  Then I will have
none of your five thousand francs."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan smiled.  "Accept
it, accept it, Planchet; and in that way you will only lose
fifteen thousand francs instead of twenty thousand, and you will
not be tempted to disregard the signature of your master and
friend, by losing nothing at all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                How well that dear Monsieur
d'Artagnan knew the hearts of men and grocers!  They who have
pronounced Don Quixote mad because he rode out to the conquest of
an empire with nobody but Sancho his squire, and they who have
pronounced Sancho mad because he accompanied his master in his
attempt to conquer the said empire, - they certainly will have no
hesitation in extending the same judgment to D'Artagnan and
Planchet.  And yet the first passed for one of the most subtle
spirits among the astute spirits of the court of France.  As to
the second, he had acquired by good right the reputation of
having one of the longest heads among the grocers of the Rue des
Lombards; consequently of Paris, and consequently of France. 
Now, to consider these two men from the point of view from which
you would consider other men, and the means by the aid of which
they contemplated to restore a monarch to his throne, compared
with other means, the shallowest brains of the country where
brains are most shallow must have revolted against the
presumptuous madness of the lieutenant and the stupidity of his
associate.  Fortunately, D'Artagnan was not a man to listen to
the idle talk of those around him, or to the comments that were
made on himself.  He had adopted the motto, "Act well, and let
people talk."  Planchet, on his part had adopted this, "Act and
say nothing."  It resulted from this, that, according to the
custom of all superior geniuses, these two men flattered
themselves, <i>intra pectus</i>, with being in the right against
all who found fault with them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                As a beginning, D'Artagnan
set out in the finest of possible weather, without a cloud in the
heavens - without a cloud on his mind, joyous and strong, calm
and decided, great in his resolution, and consequently carrying
with him a tenfold dose of that potent fluid which the shocks of
mind cause to spring from the nerves, and which procure for the
human machine a force and an influence of which future ages will
render, according to all probability, a more arithmetical account
than we can possibly do at present.  He was again, as in times
past, on that same road of adventures which had led him to
Boulogne, and which he was now traveling for the fourth time.  It
appeared to him that he could almost recognize the trace of his
own steps upon the road, and that of his fist upon the doors of
the hostelries; - his memory, always active and present, brought
back that youth which neither thirty years later his great heart
nor his wrist of steel would have belied.  What a rich nature was
that of this man!  He had all the passions, all the defects, all
the weaknesses, and the spirit of contradiction familiar to his
understanding changed all these imperfections into corresponding
qualities.  D'Artagnan, thanks to his ever active imagination,
was afraid of a shadow, and ashamed of being afraid, he marched
straight up to that shadow, and then became extravagant in his
bravery, if the danger proved to be real.  Thus everything in him
was emotion, and therefore enjoyment.  He loved the society of
others, but never became tired of his own; and more than once, if
he could have been heard when he was alone, he might have been
seen laughing at the jokes he related to himself or the tricks
his imagination created just five minutes before <i>ennui</i>
might have been looked for.  D'Artagnan was not perhaps so gay
this time as he would have been with the prospect of finding some
good friends at Calais, instead of joining the ten scamps there;
melancholy, however, did not visit him more than once a day, and
it was about five visits that he received from that somber deity
before he got sight of the sea at Boulogne, and then these visits
were indeed but short.  But when once D'Artagnan found himself
near the field of action, all other feelings but that of
confidence disappeared never to return.  From Boulogne he
followed the coast to Calais.  Calais was the place of general
rendezvous, and at Calais he had named to each of his recruits
the hostelry of "Le Grande Monarque," where living was not
extravagant, where sailors messed, and where men of the sword,
with sheath of leather, be it understood, found lodging, table,
food, and all the comforts of life, for thirty sous per diem. 
D'Artagnan proposed to himself to take them by surprise <i>in
flagrante delicto</i> of wandering life, and to judge by the
first appearance if he could count on them as trusty
companions.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                He arrived at Calais at half
past four in the afternoon.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

 </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>T</span>he hostelry
of "Le Grand Monarque" was situated in a little street parallel
to the port without looking out upon the port itself.  Some lanes
cut - as steps cut the two parallels of the ladder - the two
great straight lines of the port and the street.  By these lanes
passengers came suddenly from the port into the street, or from
the street on to the port.  D'Artagnan, arrived at the port, took
one of these lanes, and came out in front of the hostelry of "Le
Grand Monarque."  The moment was well chosen and might remind
D'Artagnan of his start in life at the hostelry of the
"Franc-Meunier" at Meung.  Some sailors who had been playing at
dice had started a quarrel, and were threatening each other
furiously.  The host, hostess, and two lads were watching with
anxiety the circle of these angry gamblers, from the midst of
which war seemed ready to break forth, bristling with knives and
hatchets.  The play, nevertheless, was continued.  A stone bench
was occupied by two men, who appeared thence to watch the door;
four tables, placed at the back of the common chamber, were
occupied by eight other individuals.  Neither the men at the
door, nor those at the tables took any part in the play or the
quarrel.  D'Artagnan recognized his ten men in these cold,
indifferent spectators.  The quarrel went on increasing.  Every
passion has, like the sea, its tide which ascends and descends. 
Reaching the climax of passion, one sailor overturned the table
and the money which was upon it.  The table fell, and the money
rolled about.  In an instant all belonging to the hostelry threw
themselves upon the stakes, and many a piece of silver was picked
up by people who stole away whilst the sailors were scuffling
with each other.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The two men on the bench and
the eight at the tables, although they seemed perfect strangers
to each other, these ten men alone, we say, appeared to have
agreed to remain impassible amidst the cries of fury and the
chinking of money.  Two only contented themselves with pushing
with their feet combatants who came under their table.  Two
others, rather than take part in this disturbance, buried their
hands in their pockets; and another two jumped upon the table
they occupied, as people do to avoid being submerged by
overflowing water.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Come, come," said
D'Artagnan to himself, not having lost one of the details we have
related, "this is a very fair gathering - circumspect, calm,
accustomed to disturbance, acquainted with blows!  <i>Peste! </i>
I have been lucky."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                All at once his attention
was called to a particular part of the room.  The two men who had
pushed the strugglers with their feet, were assailed with abuse
by the sailors, who had become reconciled.  One of them, half
drunk with passion, and quite drunk with beer, came, in a
menacing manner, to demand of the shorter of these two sages by
what right he had touched with his foot creatures of the good
God, who were not dogs.  And whilst putting this question, in
order to make it more direct, he applied his great fist to the
nose of D'Artagnan's recruit.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This man became pale,
without its being to be discerned whether his pallor arose from
anger or fear; seeing which, the sailor concluded it was from
fear, and raised his fist with the manifest intention of letting
it fall upon the head of the stranger.  But though the threatened
man did not appear to move, he dealt the sailor such a severe
blow in the stomach that he sent him rolling and howling to the
other side of the room.  At the same instant, rallied by the
<i>espirit de corps</i>, all the comrades of the conquered man
fell upon the conqueror</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The latter, with the same
coolness of which he had given proof, without committing the
imprudence of touching his weapons, took up a beer-pot with a
pewter-lid, and knocked down two or three of his assailants;
then, as he was about to yield to numbers, the seven other silent
men at the tables, who had not yet stirred, perceived that their
cause was at stake, and came to the rescue.  At the same time,
the two indifferent spectators at the door turned round with
frowning bows, indicating their evident intention of taking the
enemy in the rear, if the enemy did not cease their
aggressions.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The host, his helpers, and
two watchmen who were passing, and who from the curiosity had
penetrated too far into the room, were mixed up in the tumult and
showered with blows.  The Parisians hit like Cyclops, with an
<i>ensemble</i> and a tactic delightful to behold.  At length,
obliged to beat a retreat before superior numbers, they formed an
intrenchment behind the large table, which they raised by main
force; whilst the two others, arming themselves each with a
trestle, and using it like a great sledge-hammer, knocked down at
a blow eight sailors upon whose heads they had brought their
monstrous catapult in play.  The floor was already strewn with
wounded, and the room filled with cries and dust, when
D'Artagnan, satisfied with the test, advanced, sword in hand, and
striking with the pommel every head that came in his way, he
uttered a vigorous <i>hol&agrave;!</i> which put an instantaneous
end to the conflict.  A great back-flood directly took place from
the center to the sides of the room, so that D'Artagnan found
himself isolated and dominator.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What is this all about?"
then demanded he of the assembly, with the majestic tone of
Neptune pronouncing the <i>Quos ego</i>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                At the very instant, at the
first sound of his voice, to carry on the Virgilian metaphor,
D'Artagnan's recruits, recognizing each his sovereign lord,
discontinued their plank-fighting and trestle blows.  On their
side, the sailors, seeing that long naked sword, that martial
air, and the agile arm which came to the rescue of their enemies,
in the person of a man who seemed accustomed to command, the
sailors picked up their wounded and their pitchers.  The
Parisians wiped their brows, and viewed their leader with
respect.  D'Artagnan was loaded with thanks by the host of "Le
Grand Monarque."  He received them like a man who knows that
nothing is being offered that does not belong to him, and then
said he would go and walk upon the port till supper was ready. 
Immediately each of the recruits, who understood the summons,
took his hat, brushed the dust off his clothes, and followed
D'Artagnan.  But D'Artagnan, whilst walking and observing, took
care not to stop; he directed his course towards the downs, and
the ten men - surprised at finding themselves going in the track
of each other, uneasy at seeing on their right, on their left,
and behind them, companions upon whom they had not reckoned -
followed him, casting furtive glances at each other.  It was not
till he had arrived at the hollow part of the deepest down that
D'Artagnan, smiling to see them outdone, turned towards them,
making a friendly sign with his hand.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eh! come, come, gentlemen,"
said he, "let us not devour each other; you are made to live
together, to understand each other in all respects, and not to
devour one another."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Instantly all hesitation
ceased; the men breathed as if they had been taken out of a
coffin, and examined each other complacently.  After this
examination they turned their eyes towards their leader, who had
long been acquainted with the art of speaking to men of that
class, and who improvised the following little speech, pronounced
with an energy truly Gascon:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Gentlemen, you all know who
I am.  I have engaged you from knowing you to be brave, and
willing to associate you with me in a glorious enterprise. 
Imagine that in laboring for me you labor for the king.  I only
warn you that if you allow anything of this supposition to
appear, I shall be forced to crack your skulls immediately, in
the manner most convenient to me.  You are not ignorant,
gentlemen, that state secrets are like a mortal poison: as long
as that poison is in its box and the box is closed, it is not
injurious; out of the box, it kills.  Now draw near, and you
shall know as much of this secret as I am able to tell you."  All
drew close to him with an expression of curiosity.  "Approach,"
continued D'Artagnan, "and let not the bird which passes over our
heads, the rabbit which sports on the downs, the fish which
bounds from the waters, hear us.  Our business is to learn and to
report to monsieur le surintendant of the finances to what extent
English smuggling is injurious to the French merchants.  I shall
enter every place, and see everything.  We are poor Picard
fishermen, thrown upon the coast by a storm.  It is certain that
we must sell fish, neither more nor less, like true fishermen. 
Only people might guess who we are, and might molest us; it is
therefore necessary that we should be in a condition to defend
ourselves.  And this is why I have selected men of spirit and
courage.  We shall lead a steady life, and not incur much danger,
seeing that we have behind us a powerful protector, thanks to
whom no embarrassment is possible.  One thing alone puzzles me;
but I hope that after a short explanation, you will relieve me
from that difficulty.  The thing which puzzles me is taking with
me a crew of stupid fishermen, which crew will annoy me
immensely, whilst if, by chance, there were among you any who
have seen the sea - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! don't let that trouble
you," said one of the recruits; "I was a prisoner among the
pirates of Tunis three years, and can maneuver a boat like an
admiral."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "See," said D'Artagnan,
"what an admirable thing chance is!"  D'Artagnan pronounced these
words with an indefinable tone of feigned <i>bonhomie</i>, for he
knew very well that the victim of the pirates was an old corsair,
and had engaged him in consequence of that knowledge.  But
D'Artagnan never said more than there was need to say, in order
to leave people in doubt.  He paid himself with the explanation,
and welcomed the effect, without appearing to be preoccupied with
the cause.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And I," said a second, "I,
by chance, had an uncle who directed the works of the port of La
Rochelle.  When quite a child, I played about the boats, and I
know how to handle an oar or a sail as well as the best Ponantais
sailor."  The latter did not lie much more than the first, for he
had rowed on board his majesty's galleys six years, at Ciotat. 
Two others were more frank: they confessed honestly that they had
served on board a vessel as soldiers as punishment, and did not
blush for it.  D'Artagnan found himself, then, the leader of ten
men of war and four sailors, having at once an land army and a
sea force, which would have carried the pride of Planchet to its
height, if Planchet had known the details.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Nothing was now left but
arranging the general orders, and D'Artagnan gave them with
precision.  He enjoined his men to be ready to set out for the
Hague, some following the coast which leads to Breskens, others
the road to Antwerp.  The rendezvous was given, by calculating
each day's march, a fortnight from that time, upon the chief
place at the Hague.  D'Artagnan recommended his men to go in
couples, as they liked best, from sympathy.  He himself selected
from among those with the least disreputable look, two guards
whom he had formerly known, and whose only faults were being
drunkards and gamblers.  These men had not entirely lost all
ideas of civilization, and under proper garments their hearts
would beat again.  D'Artagnan, not to create any jealousy with
the others, made the rest go forward.  He kept his two selected
ones, clothed them from his own wardrobe, and set out with
them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                It was to these two, whom he
seemed to honor with an absolute confidence, that D'Artagnan
imparted a false secret, destined to secure the success of the
expedition.  He confessed to them that the object was not to
learn to what extent French merchants were injured by English
smuggling, but to learn how far French smuggling could annoy
English trade.  These men appeared convinced; they were
effectively so.  D'Artagnan was quite sure that at the first
debauch, when thoroughly drunk, one of the two would divulge the
secret to the whole band.  His game appeared infallible.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                A fortnight after all we
have said had taken place at Calais, the whole troop assembled at
the Hague.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Then D'Artagnan perceived
that all his men, with remarkable intelligence, had already
travestied themselves into sailors, more or less ill-treated by
the sea.  D'Artagnan left them to sleep in a den in Newkerke
street, whilst he lodged comfortably upon the Grand Canal.  He
learned that the king of England had come back to his old ally,
William II. of Nassau, stadtholder of Holland.  He learned also
that the refusal of Louis XIV. had a little cooled the protection
afforded him up to that time, and in consequence he had gone to
reside in a little village house at Scheveningen, situated in the
downs, on the sea-shore, about a league from the Hague.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                There, it was said, the
unfortunate banished king consoled himself in his exile, by
looking, with the melancholy peculiar to the princes of his race,
at that immense North Sea, which separated him from his England,
as it had formerly separated Mary Stuart from France.  There,
behind the trees of the beautiful wood of Scheveningen, on the
fine sand upon which grows the golden broom of the down, Charles
II. vegetated as it did, more unfortunate, for he had life and
thought, and he hoped and despaired by turns.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan went once as far
as Scheveningen, in order to be certain that all was true that
was said of the king.  He beheld Charles II., pensive and alone,
coming out of a little door opening into the wood, and walking on
the beach in the setting sun, without even attracting the
attention of the fishermen, who, on their return in the evening,
drew, like the ancient mariners of the Archipelago, their barks
up upon the sand of the shore.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan recognized the
king; he saw him fix his melancholy look upon the immense extent
of the waters, and absorb upon his pale countenance the red rays
of the sun already cut by the black line of the horizon.  Then
Charles returned to his isolated abode, always alone, slow and
sad, amusing himself with making the friable and moving sand
creak beneath his feet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                That very evening D'Artagnan
hired for a thousand livres a fishing-boat worth four thousand. 
He paid a thousand livres down, and deposited the three thousand
with a Burgomaster, after which he brought on board, without
their being seen, the six men who formed his land army; and with
the rising tide, at three o'clock in the morning, he got into the
open sea, maneuvering ostensibly with the four others, and
depending upon the science of his galley slave as upon that of
the first pilot of the port.</p>

and men were thus occupied with England, which governed itself
quite alone, and which, it must be said in its praise, had never
been so badly governed, a man upon whom God had fixed his eye,
and placed his finger, a man predestined to write his name in
brilliant letters upon the page of history, was pursuing in the
face of the world a work full of mystery and audacity.  He went
on, and no one knew whither he meant to go, although not only
England, but France, and Europe, watched him marching with a firm
step and head held high.  All that was known of this man we are
about to tell.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk had just declared
himself in favor of the liberty of the Rump Parliament, a
parliament which General Lambert, imitating Cromwell, whose
lieutenant he had been, had just blocked up so closely, in order
to bring it to his will, that no member, during all the blockade,
was able to go out, and only one, Peter Wentworth, had been able
to get in.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Lambert and Monk -
everything was summed up in these two men; the first representing
military despotism, the second pure republicanism.  These men
were the two sole political representatives of that revolution in
which Charles I. had first lost his crown, and afterwards his
head.  As regarded Lambert, he did not dissemble his views; he
sought to establish a military government, and to be himself the
head of that government.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk, a rigid republican,
some said, wished to maintain the Rump Parliament, that visible
though degenerated representative of the republic.  Monk, artful
and ambitious, said others, wished simply to make of this
parliament, which he affected to protect, a solid step by which
to mount the throne which Cromwell had left empty, but upon which
he had never dared to take his seat.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Thus Lambert by persecuting
the parliament, and Monk by declaring for it, had mutually
proclaimed themselves enemies of each other.  Monk and Lambert,
therefore, had at first thought of creating an army each for
himself: Monk in Scotland, where were the Presbyterians and the
royalists, that is to say, the malcontents; Lambert in London,
where was found, as is always the case, the strongest opposition
to the existing power which it had beneath its eyes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk had pacified Scotland,
he had there formed for himself an army, and found an asylum. 
The one watched the other.  Monk knew that the day was not yet
come, the day marked by the Lord for a great change; his sword,
therefore, appeared glued to the sheath.  Inexpugnable in his
wild and mountainous Scotland, an absolute general, king of an
army of eleven thousand old soldiers, whom he had more than once
led on to victory; as well informed, nay, even better, of the
affairs of London, than Lambert, who held garrison in the city, -
such was the position of Monk, when, at a hundred leagues from
London, he declared himself for the parliament.  Lambert, on the
contrary, as we have said, lived in the capital.  That was the
center of all his operations, and he there collected all around
him all his friends, and all the people of the lower class,
eternally inclined to cherish the enemies of constituted
power.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                It was then in London that
Lambert learnt the support that, from the frontiers of Scotland,
Monk lent to the parliament.  He judged there was no time to be
lost, and that the Tweed was not so far distant from the Thames
that an army could not march from one river to the other,
particularly when it was well commanded.  He knew, besides, that
as fast as the soldiers of Monk penetrated into England, they
would form on their route that ball of snow, the emblem of the
globe of fortune, which is for the ambitious nothing but a step
growing unceasingly higher to conduct him to his object.  He got
together, therefore, his army, formidable at the same time for
its composition and its numbers, and hastened to meet Monk, who,
on his part, like a prudent navigator sailing amidst rocks,
advanced by very short marches, listening to the reports which
came from London.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The two armies came in sight
of each other near Newcastle; Lambert, arriving first, encamped
in the city itself.  Monk, always circumspect, stopped where he
was, and placed his general quarters at Coldstream, on the
Tweed.  The sight of Lambert spread joy through Monk's army,
whilst, on the contrary, the sight of Monk threw disorder into
Lambert's army.  It might have been thought that these intrepid
warriors, who had made such a noise in the streets of London, had
set out with the hopes of meeting no one, and that now seeing
that they had met an army, and that that army hoisted before them
not only a standard, but still further, a cause and a principle,
- it might have been believed, we say, that these intrepid
warriors had begun to reflect that they were less good
republicans than the soldiers of Monk, since the latter supported
the parliament; whilst Lambert supported nothing, not even
himself.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                As to Monk, if he had had to
reflect, or if he did reflect, it must have been after a sad
fashion, for history relates - and that modest dame, it is well
known, never lies - history relates, that the day of his arrival
at Coldstream search was made in vain throughout the place for a
single sheep.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                If Monk had commanded an
English army, that was enough to have brought about a general
desertion.  But it is not with the Scots as it is with the
English, to whom that fluid flesh which is called blood is a
paramount necessity; the Scots, a poor and sober race, live upon
a little barley crushed between two stones, diluted with the
water of the fountain, and cooked upon another stone, heated.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The Scots, their
distribution of barley being made, cared very little whether
there was or was not any meat in Coldstream.  Monk, little
accustomed to barley-cakes, was hungry, and his staff, at least
as hungry as himself, looked with anxiety right and left, to know
what was being prepared for supper.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk ordered search to be
made; his scouts had on arriving in the place found it deserted
and the cupboards empty; upon butchers and bakers it was of no
use depending in Coldstream.  The smallest morsel of bread, then,
could not be found for the general's table.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                As accounts succeeded each
other, all equally unsatisfactory, Monk, seeing terror and
discouragement upon every face, declared that he was not hungry;
besides, they should eat on the morrow, since Lambert was there
probably with the intention of giving battle, and consequently
would give up his provisions, if he were forced from Newcastle,
or forever to relieve Monk's soldiers from hunger if he
conquered.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This consolation was only
efficacious upon a very small number; but of what importance was
it to Monk? for Monk was very absolute, under the appearance of
the most perfect mildness.  Every one, therefore, was obliged to
be satisfied, or at least to appear so.  Monk, quite as hungry as
his people, but affecting perfect indifference for the absent
mutton, cut a fragment of tobacco, half an inch long, from the
<i>carotte</i> of a sergeant who formed part of his suite, and
began to masticate the said fragment, assuring his lieutenant
that hunger was a chimera, and that, besides, people were never
hungry when they had anything to chew.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This joke satisfied some of
those who had resisted Monk's first deduction drawn from the
neighborhood of Lambert's army; the number of the dissentients
diminished greatly; the guard took their posts, the patrols
began, and the general continued his frugal repast beneath his
open tent.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Between his camp and that of
the enemy stood an old abbey, of which, at the present day, there
only remain some ruins, but which then was in existence, and was
called Newcastle Abbey.  It was built upon a vast site,
independent at once of the plain and of the river, because it was
almost a marsh fed by springs and kept up by rains. 
Nevertheless, in the midst of these pools of water, covered with
long grass, rushes, and reeds, were seen solid spots of ground,
formerly used as the kitchen-garden, the park, the
pleasure-gardens, and other dependencies of the abbey, looking
like one of those great sea-spiders, whose body is round, whilst
the claws go diverging round from this circumference.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The kitchen-garden, one of
the longest claws of the abbey, extended to Monk's camp. 
Unfortunately it was, as we have said, early in June, and the
kitchen-garden, being abandoned, offered no resources.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk had ordered this spot
to be guarded, as most subject to surprises.  The fires of the
enemy's general were plainly to be perceived on the other side of
the abbey.  But between these fires and the abbey extended the
Tweed, unfolding its luminous scales beneath the thick shade of
tall green oaks.  Monk was perfectly well acquainted with this
position, Newcastle and its environs having already more than
once been his headquarters.  He knew that by this day his enemy
might without doubt throw a few scouts into these ruins and
promote a skirmish, but that by night he would take care to
abstain from such a risk.  He felt himself, therefore, in
security.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Thus his soldiers saw him,
after what he boastingly called his supper - that is to say,
after the exercise of mastication reported by us at the
commencement of this chapter - like Napoleon on the eve of
Austerlitz, seated asleep in his rush chair, half beneath the
light of his lamp, half beneath the reflection of the moon,
commencing its ascent in the heavens, which denoted that it was
nearly half past nine in the evening.  All at once Monk was
roused from his half sleep, fictitious perhaps, by a troop of
soldiers, who came with joyous cries, and kicked the poles of his
tent with a humming noise as if on purpose to wake him.  There
was no need of so much noise; the general opened his eyes
quickly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, my children, what is
going on now?" asked the general.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "General!" replied several
voices at once, "General! you shall have some supper."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have had my supper,
gentlemen," replied he quietly, "and was comfortably digesting
it, as you see.  But come in, and tell me what brings you
hither."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good news, general."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bah!  Has Lambert sent us
word that he will fight to-morrow?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No; but we have just
captured a fishing-boat conveying fish to Newcastle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you have done very
wrong, my friends.  These gentlemen from London are delicate,
must have their first course; you will put them sadly out of
humor this evening, and to-morrow they will be pitiless.  It
would really be in good taste to send back to Lambert both his
fish and his fishermen, unless - " and the general reflected an
instant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Tell me," continued he,
"what are these fishermen, if you please?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Some Picard seamen who were
fishing on the coasts of France or Holland, and who have been
thrown upon ours by a gale of wind."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do any among them speak our
language?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The leader spoke some few
words of English."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The mistrust of the general
was awakened in proportion as fresh information reached him. 
"That is well," said he.  "I wish to see these men; bring them to
me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                An officer immediately went
to fetch them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How many are there of
them?" continued Monk; "and what is their vessel?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "There are ten or twelve of
them, general, and they were aboard of a kind of
<i>chasse-mar&eacute;e</i>, as it is called - Dutch-built,
apparently."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you say they were
carrying fish to Lambert's camp?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, general, and they seem
to have had good luck in their fishing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Humph!  We shall see that,"
said Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                At this moment the officer
returned, bringing the leader of the fishermen with him.  He was
a man from fifty to fifty-five years old, but good-looking for
his age.  He was of middle height, and wore a <i>justaucorps</i>
of coarse wool, a cap pulled down over his eyes, a cutlass hung
from his belt, and he walked with the hesitation peculiar to
sailors, who, never knowing, thanks to the movement of the
vessel, whether their foot will be placed upon the plank or upon
nothing, give to every one of their steps a fall as firm as if
they were driving a pile.  Monk, with an acute and penetrating
look, examined the fisherman for some time, while the latter
smiled, with that smile, half cunning, half silly, peculiar to
French peasants.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do you speak English?"
asked Monk, in excellent French.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! but badly, my lord,"
replied the fisherman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This reply was made much
more with the lively and sharp accentuation of the people beyond
the Loire, than with the slightly-drawling accent of the
countries of the west and north of France.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But you do speak it?"
persisted Monk, in order to examine his accent once more.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eh! we men of the sea,"
replied the fisherman, "speak a little of all languages."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then you are a sea
fisherman?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am at present, my lord -
a fisherman, and a famous fisherman, too.  I have taken a barbel
that weighs at least thirty pounds, and more than fifty mullets;
I have also some little whitings that will fry beautifully."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You appear to me to have
fished more frequently in the Gulf of Gascony than in the
Channel," said Monk, smiling.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, I am from the south;
but does that prevent me from being a good fisherman, my
lord?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! not at all; I shall buy
your fish.  And now speak frankly; for whom did you destine
them?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord, I will conceal
nothing from you.  I was going to Newcastle, following the coast,
when a party of horsemen who were passing along in an opposite
direction made a sign to my bark to turn back to your honor's
camp, under penalty of a discharge of musketry.  As I was not
armed for fighting," added the fisherman, smiling, "I was forced
to submit."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And why did you go to
Lambert's camp in preference to mine?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord, I will be frank;
will your lordship permit me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, and even if need be
shall command you to be so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, my lord, I was going
to M. Lambert's camp because those gentlemen from the city pay
well - whilst your Scotchmen, Puritans, Presbyterians,
Covenanters, or whatever you chose to call them, eat but little,
and pay for nothing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk shrugged his shoulders,
without, however, being able to refrain from smiling at the same
time.  "How is it that, being from the south, you come to fish on
our coasts?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Because I have been fool
enough to marry in Picardy."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes; but even Picardy is
not England."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord, man shoves his
boat into the sea, but God and the wind do the rest, and drive
the boat where they please."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You had, then, no intention
of landing on our coasts?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Never."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And what route were you
steering?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "We were returning from
Ostend, where some mackerel had already been seen, when a sharp
wind from the south drove us from our course; then, seeing that
it was useless to struggle against it, we let it drive us.  It
then became necessary, not to lose our fish, which were good, to
go and sell them at the nearest English port, and that was
Newcastle.  We were told the opportunity was good, as there was
an increase of population in the camp, an increase of population
in the city; both, we were told, were full of gentlemen, very
rich and very hungry.  So we steered our course towards
Newcastle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And your companions, where
are they?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, my companions have
remained on board; they are sailors without the least
instruction."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Whilst you - " said
Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who, I?" said the
<i>patron</i>, laughing; "I have sailed about with my father; and
I know what is called a sou, a crown, a pistole, a louis, and a
double louis, in all the languages of Europe; my crew, therefore,
listen to me as they would to an oracle, and obey me as if I were
an admiral."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then it was you who
preferred M. Lambert as the best customer?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, certainly.  And, to be
frank, my lord, was I wrong?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You will see that by and
by."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "At all events, my lord, if
there is a fault, the fault is mine; and my comrades should not
be dealt hardly with on that account."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This is decidedly an
intelligent, sharp fellow," thought Monk.  Then, after a few
minutes' silence employed in scrutinizing the fisherman, - "You
come from Ostend, did you not say?" asked the general.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, my lord, in a straight
line."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You have then heard of the
affairs of the day; for I have no doubt that both in France and
Holland they excite interest.  What is he doing who calls himself
king of England?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, my lord!" cried the
fisherman, with loud and expansive frankness, "that is a lucky
question, and you could not put it to anybody better than to me,
for in truth I can make you a famous reply.  Imagine, my lord,
that when putting into Ostend to sell the few mackerel we had
caught, I saw the ex-king walking on the downs waiting for his
horses, which were to take him to the Hague.  He is a rather
tall, pale man, with black hair, and somewhat hard-featured.  He
looks ill, and I don't think the air of Holland agrees with
him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk followed with the
greatest attention the rapid, heightened, and diffuse
conversation of the fisherman, in a language which was not his
own, but which, as we have said, he spoke with great facility. 
The fisherman, on his part, employed sometimes a French word,
sometimes an English word, and sometimes a word which appeared
not to belong to any language, but was, in truth, pure Gascon. 
Fortunately his eyes spoke for him, and that so eloquently, that
it was possible to lose a word from his mouth, but not a single
intention from his eyes.  The general appeared more and more
satisfied with his examination.  "You must have heard that this
ex-king, as you call him, was going to the Hague for some
purpose?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, yes," said the
fisherman, "I heard that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And what was his
purpose?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Always the same," said the
fisherman.  "Must he not always entertain the fixed idea of
returning to England?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is true," said Monk,
pensively.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Without reckoning," added
the fisherman, "that the stadtholder - you know, my lord, William
II.? - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He will assist him with all
his power."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! did you hear that
said?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, but I think so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are quite a politician,
apparently," said Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, we sailors, my lord,
who are accustomed to study the water and the air - that is to
say, the two most changeable things in the world - are seldom
deceived as to the rest."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Now, then," said Monk,
changing the conversation, "I am told you are going to provision
us."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I shall do my best, my
lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How much do you ask for
your fish in the first place?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Not such a fool as to name
a price, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Because my fish is
yours."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "By what right?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "By that of the
strongest."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But my intention is to pay
you for it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is very generous of
you, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And the worth of it - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord, I fix no
price."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What do you ask, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I only ask to be permitted
to go away."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Where? - to General
Lambert's camp?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I!" cried the fisherman;
"what should I go to Newcastle for, now I have no longer any
fish?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "At all events, listen to
me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I do, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I shall give you some
advice."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How, my lord! - pay me and
give me good advice likewise!  You overwhelm me, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk looked more earnestly
than ever at the fisherman, about whom he still appeared to
entertain some suspicion.  "Yes, I shall pay you, and give you a
piece of advice; for the two things are connected.  If you
return, then, to General Lambert - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The fisherman made a
movement of his head and shoulders, which signified, "If he
persists in it, I won't contradict him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do not cross the marsh,"
continued Monk: "you will have money in your pocket, and there
are in the marsh some Scottish ambuscaders I have placed there. 
Those people are very intractable; they understand but very
little of the language which you speak, although it appears to me
to be composed of three languages.  They might take from you what
I have given you, and, on your return to your country, you would
not fail to say that General Monk has two hands, the one
Scottish, and the other English; and that he takes back with the
Scottish hand what he has given with the English hand."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! general, I shall go
where you like, be sure of that," said the fisherman, with a fear
too expressive not to be exaggerated.  "I only wish to remain
here, if you will allow me to remain."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I readily believe you,"
said Monk, with an imperceptible smile, "but I cannot,
nevertheless, keep you in my tent."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have no such wish, my
lord, and desire only that your lordship should point out where
you will have me posted.  Do not trouble yourself about us - with
us a night soon passes away."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You shall be conducted to
your bark."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "As your lordship pleases. 
Only, if your lordship would allow me to be taken back by a
carpenter, I should be extremely grateful."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why so?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Because the gentlemen of
your army, in dragging my boat up the river with a cable pulled
by their horses, have battered it a little upon the rocks of the
shore, so that I have at least two feet of water in my hold, my
lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The greater reason why you
should watch your boat, I think."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord, I am quite at your
orders," said the fisherman; "I shall empty my baskets where you
wish; then you will pay me, if you please to do so; and you will
send me away, if it appears right to you.  You see I am very
easily managed and pleased, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Come, come, you are a very
good sort of fellow," said Monk, whose scrutinizing glance had
not been able to find a single shade in the clear eye of the
fisherman.  "Holloa, Digby!"  An aid-de-camp appeared.  "You will
conduct this good fellow and his companions to the little tents
of the canteens, in front of the marshes, so that they will be
near their bark, and yet will not sleep on board to-night.  What
is the matter, Spithead?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Spithead was the sergeant
from whom Monk had borrowed a piece of tobacco for his supper. 
Spithead having entered the general's tent without being sent
for, had drawn this question from Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord," said he, "a
French gentleman has just presented himself at the outposts and
wishes to speak to your honor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                All this was said, be it
understood, in English; but, notwithstanding, it produced a
slight emotion in the fisherman, which Monk, occupied with his
sergeant, did not remark.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who is the gentleman?"
asked Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord," replied Spithead,
"he told it me; but those devils of French names are so difficult
to pronounce for a Scottish throat, that I could not retain it. 
I believe, however, from what the guards say, that it is the same
gentleman who presented himself yesterday at the halt, and whom
your honor would not receive."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is true; I was holding
a council of officers."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Will your honor give any
orders respecting this gentleman?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, let him be brought
here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Must we take any
precautions?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Such as what?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Blinding his eyes, for
instance?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To what purpose?  He can
only see what I desire should be seen; that is to say, that I
have around me eleven thousand brave men, who ask no better than
to have their throats cut in honor of the parliament of Scotland
and England."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And this man, my lord?"
said Spithead, pointing to the fisherman, who, during this
conversation, had remained standing and motionless, like a man
who sees but does not understand.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, that is true," said
Monk.  Then turning towards the fisherman, - "I shall see you
again, my brave fellow," said he; "I have selected a lodging for
you.  Digby, take him to it.  Fear nothing; your money shall be
sent to you presently."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thank you, my lord," said
the fisherman, and after having bowed, he left the tent,
accompanied by Digby.  Before he had gone a hundred paces he
found his companions, who were whispering with a volubility which
did not appear exempt from uneasiness, but he made them a sign
which seemed to reassure them.  "<i>Hol&agrave;</i> , you
fellows!" said the <i>patron</i>, "come this way.  His lordship,
General Monk, has the generosity to pay us for our fish, and the
goodness to give us hospitality for to-night."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The fishermen gathered round
their leader, and, conducted by Digby, the little troop proceeded
towards the canteens, the post, as may be remembered, which had
been assigned them.  As they went along in the dark, the
fishermen passed close to the guards who were conducting the
French gentleman to General Monk.  This gentleman was on
horseback and enveloped in a large cloak, which prevented the
<i>patron</i> from seeing him, however great his curiosity might
be.  As to the gentleman, ignorant that he was elbowing
compatriots, he did not pay any attention to the little
troop.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The aid-de-camp settled his
guests in a tolerably comfortable tent, from which was dislodged
an Irish canteen woman, who went, with her six children, to sleep
where she could.  A large fire was burning in front of this tent,
and threw its purple light over the grassy pools of the marsh,
rippled by a fresh breeze.  The arrangements made, the
aid-de-camp wished the fishermen good-night, calling to their
notice that they might see from the door of the tent the masts of
their bark, which was tossing gently on the Tweed, a proof that
it had not yet sunk.  The sight of this appeared to delight the
leader of the fishermen infinitely.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>T</span>he French
gentleman whom Spithead had announced to Monk, and who, closely
wrapped in his cloak, had passed by the fishermen who left the
general's tent five minutes before he entered it, - the French
gentleman went through the various posts without even casting his
eyes around him, for fear of appearing indiscreet.  As the order
had been given, he was conducted to the tent of the general.  The
gentleman was left alone in the sort of ante-chamber in front of
the principal body of the tent, where he awaited Monk, who only
delayed till he had heard the report of his people, and observed
through the opening of the canvas the countenance of the person
who solicited an audience.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Without doubt, the report of
those who had accompanied the French gentleman established the
discretion with which he had behaved, for the first impression
the stranger received of the welcome made him by the general was
more favorable than he could have expected at such a moment, and
on the part of so suspicious a man.  Nevertheless, according to
his custom, when Monk found himself in the presence of a
stranger, he fixed upon him his penetrating eyes, which scrutiny,
the stranger, on his part, sustained without embarrassment or
notice.  At the end of a few seconds, the general made a gesture
with his hand and head in sign of attention.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord," said the
gentleman, in excellent English, "I have requested an interview
with your honor, for an affair of importance."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," replied Monk, in
French, "you speak our language well for a son of the continent. 
I ask your pardon - for doubtless the question is indiscreet - do
you speak French with the same purity?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "There is nothing
surprising, my lord, in my speaking English tolerably; I resided
for some time in England in my youth, and since then I have made
two voyages to this country."  These words were spoken in French,
and with a purity of accent that bespoke not only a Frenchman,
but a Frenchman from the vicinity of Tours.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And what part of England
have you resided in, monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In my youth, London, my
lord; then, about 1635, I made a pleasure trip to Scotland; and
lastly, in 1648, I lived for some time at Newcastle, particularly
in the convent, the gardens of which are now occupied by your
army."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Excuse me, monsieur; but
you must comprehend that these questions are necessary on my part
- do you not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It would astonish me, my
lord, if they were not asked."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Now, then, monsieur, what
can I do to serve you?  What do you wish?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This, my lord; - but, in
the first place, are we alone?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Perfectly so, monsieur,
except, of course, the post which guards us."  So saying, Monk
pulled open the canvas with his hand, and pointed to the soldier
placed at ten paces from the tent, and who, at the first call,
could have rendered assistance in a second.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In that case, my lord,"
said the gentleman, in as calm a tone as if he had been for a
length of time in habits of intimacy with his interlocutor, "I
have made up my mind to address myself to you, because I believe
you to be an honest man.  Indeed, the communication I am about to
make to you will prove to you the esteem in which I hold
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk, astonished at this
language, which established between him and the French gentleman
equality at least,  raised his piercing eye to the stranger's
face, and with a sensible irony conveyed by the inflection of his
voice alone, for not a muscle of his face moved, - "I thank you,
monsieur," said he; "but, in the first place, to whom have I the
honor of speaking?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I sent you my name by your
sergeant, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Excuse him, monsieur, he is
a Scotsman, - he could not retain it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am called the Comte de la
F&egrave;re, monsieur," said Athos, bowing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The Comte de la
F&egrave;re?" said Monk, endeavoring to recollect the name. 
"Pardon me, monsieur, but this appears to be the first time I
have ever heard that name.  Do you fill any post at the court of
France?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "None; I am a simple
gentleman."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What dignity?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "King Charles I. made me a
knight of the Garter, and Queen Anne of Austria has given me the
cordon of the Holy Ghost.  These are my only dignities."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The Garter! the Holy
Ghost!  Are you a knight of those two orders, monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And on what occasions have
such favors been bestowed upon you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "For services rendered to
their majesties."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk looked with
astonishment at this man, who appeared to him so simple and so
great at the same time.  Then, as if he had renounced endeavoring
to penetrate this mystery of a simplicity and grandeur upon which
the stranger did not seem disposed to give him any other
information than that which he had already received, - "Did you
present yourself yesterday at our advanced posts?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And was sent back?  Yes, my
lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Many officers, monsieur,
would permit no one to enter their camp, particularly on the eve
of a probable battle.  But I differ from my colleagues, and like
to leave nothing behind me.  Every advice is good to me; all
danger is sent to me by God, and I weigh it in my hand with the
energy He has given me.  So, yesterday, you were only sent back
on account of the council I was holding.  To-day I am at liberty,
- speak."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord, you have done much
better in receiving me, for what I have to say has nothing to do
with the battle you are about to fight with General Lambert, or
with your camp; and the proof is, that I turned away my head that
I might not see your men, and closed my eyes that I might not
count your tents.  No, I came to speak to you, my lord, on my own
account."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Speak then, monsieur," said
Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Just now," continued Athos,
"I had the honor of telling your lordship that for a long time I
lived in Newcastle; it was in the time of Charles I., and when
the king was given up to Cromwell by the Scots."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I know," said Monk,
coldly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I had at that time a large
sum in gold, and on the eve of the battle, from a presentiment
perhaps of the turn which things would take on the morrow, I
concealed it in the principal vault of the covenant of Newcastle,
in the tower whose summit you now see silvered by the moonbeams. 
My treasure has then remained interred there, and I have come to
entreat your honor to permit me to withdraw it before, perhaps,
the battle turning that way, a mine or some other war engine has
destroyed the building and scattered my gold, or rendered it so
apparent that the soldiers will take possession of it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk was well acquainted
with mankind; he saw in the physiognomy of this gentleman all the
energy, all the reason, all the circumspection possible; he could
therefore only attribute to a magnanimous confidence the
revelation the Frenchman had made him, and he showed himself
profoundly touched by it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," said he, "you
have augured well of me.  But is the sum worth the trouble to
which you expose yourself?  Do you even believe that it can be in
the same place where you left it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is there monsieur, I do
not doubt."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is a reply to one
question; but to the other.  I asked you if the sum was so large
as to warrant your exposing yourself thus."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is really large; yes, my
lord, for it is a million I inclosed in two barrels."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A million!" cried Monk, at
whom this time, in turn, Athos looked earnestly and long.  Monk
perceived this, and his mistrust returned.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Here is a man," said he to
himself, "who is laying a snare for me.  So you wish to withdraw
this money, monsieur," replied he, "as I understand?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "If you please, my
lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To-day?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This very evening, and that
on account of the circumstances I have named."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But, monsieur," objected
Monk, "General Lambert is as near the abbey where you have to act
as I am.  Why, then, have you not addressed yourself to him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Because, my lord, when one
acts in important matters, it is best to consult one's instinct
before everything.  Well, General Lambert does not inspire with
me so much confidence as you do."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Be it so, monsieur.  I
shall assist you in recovering your money, if, however, it can
still be there; for that is far from likely.  Since 1648 twelve
years have rolled away, and many events have taken place."  Monk
dwelt upon this point to see if the French gentleman would seize
the evasions that were open to him, but Athos did not
hesitate.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I assure you, my lord," he
said firmly, "that my conviction is, that the two barrels have
neither changed place nor master."  This reply had removed one
suspicion from the mind of Monk, but it had suggested another. 
Without doubt this Frenchman was some emissary sent to entice
into error the protector of the parliament; the gold was nothing
but a lure; and by the help of this lure they thought to excite
the cupidity of the general.  This gold might not exist.  It was
Monk's business, then, to seize the Frenchman in the act of
falsehood and trick, and to draw from the false step itself in
which his enemies wished to entrap him, a triumph for his
renown.  When Monk was determined how to act, -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," said he to
Athos, "without doubt you will do me the honor to share my supper
this evening?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, my lord," replied
Athos, bowing; "for you do me an honor of which I feel myself
worthy, by the inclination which drew me towards you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is so much the more
gracious on your part to accept my invitation with such
frankness, as my cooks are but few and inexperienced, and my
providers have returned this evening empty-handed; so that if it
had not been for a fisherman of your nation who strayed into our
camp, General Monk would have gone to bed without his supper
to-day; I have, then, some fresh fish to offer you, as the vendor
assures me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord, it is principally
for the sake of having the honor to pass an hour with you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                After this exchange of
civilities, during which Monk had lost nothing of his
circumspection, the supper, or what was to serve for one, had
been laid upon a deal table.  Monk invited the Comte de la
F&egrave;re to be seated at this table, and took his place
opposite to him.  A single dish of boiled fish, set before the
two illustrious guests, was more tempting to hungry stomachs than
to delicate palates.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Whilst supping, that is,
while eating the fish, washed down with bad ale, Monk got Athos
to relate to him the last events of the Fronde, the
reconciliation of M. de Cond&eacute; with the king, and the
probable marriage of the infanta of Spain; but he avoided, as
Athos himself avoided it, all allusion to the political interests
which united, or rather which disunited at this time, England,
France and Holland.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk, in this conversation,
convinced himself of one thing, which he must have remarked after
the first words exchanged: that was, that he had to deal with a
man of high distinction.  He could not be an assassin, and it was
repugnant to Monk to believe him to be a spy; but there was
sufficient <i>finesse</i> and at the same time firmness in Athos
to lead Monk to fancy he was a conspirator.  When they had
quitted the table, "You still believe in your treasure, then,
monsieur?" asked Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Quite seriously?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Seriously."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you think you can find
the place again where it was buried?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "At the first
inspection."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, monsieur, from
curiosity I shall accompany you.  And it is so much the more
necessary that I should accompany you, that you would find great
difficulties in passing through the camp without me or one of my
lieutenants."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "General, I would not suffer
you to inconvenience yourself if I did not, in fact, stand in
need of your company; but as I recognize that this company is not
only honorable, but necessary, I accept it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do you desire we should
take any people with us?" asked Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "General, I believe that
would be useless, if you yourself do not see the necessity for
it.  Two men and a horse will suffice to transport the two casks
on board the felucca which brought me hither."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But it will be necessary to
pick, dig, and remove the earth, and split stones; you don't
intend doing this work yourself, monsieur, do you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "General, there is no
picking or digging required.  The treasure is buried in the
sepulchral vault of the convent, under a stone in which is fixed
a large iron ring, and under which there are four steps leading
down.  The two casks are there, placed end to end, covered with a
coat of plaster in the form of a bier.  There is, besides, an
inscription, which will enable me to recognize the stone; and as
I am not willing, in an affair of delicacy and confidence, to
keep the secret from your honor, here is the inscription: -
'<i>Hic jacet venerabilis, Petrus Gulielmus Scott, Canon Honorab.
Convent&ucirc;s Novi Castelli.  Obiit quart&acirc; et
decim&acirc; Feb. ann. Dom.</i> MCCVIII.  <i>Requiescat in
pace.</i>'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk did not lose a single
word.  He was astonished either at the marvelous duplicity of
this man and the superior style in which he played his part, or
at the good loyal faith with which he presented his request, in a
situation in which concerning a million of money, risked against
the blow from a dagger, amidst an army that would have looked
upon the theft as a restitution.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very well," said he; "I
shall accompany you; and the adventure appears to me so
wonderful, that I shall carry the torch myself."  And saying
these words, he girded on a short sword, placed a pistol in his
belt, disclosing in this movement, which opened his doublet a
little, the fine rings of a coat of mail, destined to protect him
from the first dagger-thrust of an assassin.  After which he took
a Scottish dirk in his left hand, and then turning to Athos, "Are
you ready, monsieur?" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos, as if in opposition
to what Monk had done, unfastened his poniard, which he placed
upon the table; unhooked his sword-belt, which he laid close to
his poniard; and, without affectation, opening his doublet as if
to look for his handkerchief, showed beneath his fine cambric
shirt his naked breast, without weapons either offensive or
defensive.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This is truly a singular
man," said Monk; "he is without any arms; he has an ambuscade
placed somewhere yonder."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "General," said he, as if he
had divined Monk's thought, "you wish we should be alone; that is
very right, but a great captain ought never to expose himself
with temerity.  It is night, the passage of the marsh may present
dangers; be accompanied."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are right," replied he,
calling Digby.  The aid-de-camp appeared.  "Fifty men with swords
and muskets," said he, looking at Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is too few if there is
danger, too many if there is not."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I will go alone," said
Monk; "I want nobody.  Come, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>A</span>thos and Monk
passed over, in going from the camp towards the Tweed, that part
of the ground which Digby had traversed with the fishermen coming
from the Tweed to the camp.  The aspect of this place, the aspect
of the changes man had wrought in it, was of a nature to produce
a great effect upon a lively and delicate imagination like that
of Athos.  Athos looked at nothing but these desolate spots; Monk
looked at nothing but Athos - at Athos, who, with his eyes
sometimes directed towards heaven, and sometimes towards the
earth, sought, thought, and sighed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Digby, whom the last orders
of the general, and particularly the accent with which he had
given them, had at first a little excited, Digby followed the
pair at about twenty paces, but the general having turned round
as if astonished to find his orders had not been obeyed, the
aid-de-camp perceived his indiscretion, and returned to his
tent.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                He supposed that the general
wished to make, incognito, one of those reviews of vigilance
which every experienced captain never fails to make on the eve of
a decisive engagement: he explained to himself the presence of
Athos in this case as an inferior explains all that is mysterious
on the part of his leader.  Athos might be, and, indeed, in the
eyes of Digby, must be, a spy, whose information was to enlighten
the general.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                At the end of a walk of
about ten minutes among the tents and posts, which were closer
together near the headquarters, Monk entered upon a little
causeway which diverged into three branches.  That on the left
led to the river, that in the middle to Newcastle Abbey on the
marsh, that on the right crossed the first lines of Monk's camp;
that is to say, the lines nearest to Lambert's army.  Beyond the
river was an advanced post, belonging to Monk's army, which
watched the enemy; it was composed of one hundred and fifty
Scots.  They had swum across the Tweed, and, in case of attack,
were to recross it in the same manner, giving the alarm; but as
there was no post at that spot, and as Lambert's soldiers were
not so prompt at taking to the water as Monk's were, the latter
appeared not to have as much uneasiness on that side.  On this
side of the river, at about five hundred paces from the old
abbey, the fishermen had taken up their abode amidst a crowd of
small tents raised by soldiers of the neighboring clans, who had
with them their wives and children.  All this confusion, seen by
the moon's light, presented a striking <i>coup d'&oelig;il</i>;
the half shadow enlarged every detail, and the light, that
flatterer which only attaches itself to the polished side of
things, courted upon each rusty musket the point still left
intact, and upon every rag of canvas the whitest and least
sullied part.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk arrived then with
Athos, crossing this spot, illumined with a double light, the
silver splendor of the moon, and the red blaze of the fires at
the meeting of these three causeways; there he stopped, and
addressing his companion, - "Monsieur," said he, "do you know
your road?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "General, if I am not
mistaken, the middle causeway leads straight to the abbey."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is right; but we shall
want lights to guide us in the vaults."  Monk turned round.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah!  I thought Digby was
following us!" said he.  "So much the better; he will procure us
what we want."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, general, there is a
man yonder who has been walking behind us for some time."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Digby!" cried Monk. 
"Digby! come here, if you please."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                But instead of obeying, the
shadow made a motion of surprise, and, retreating instead of
advancing, it bent down and disappeared along the jetty on the
left, directing its course towards the lodging of the
fishermen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It appears not to be
Digby," said Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Both had followed the shadow
which had vanished.  But it was not so rare a thing for a man to
be wandering about at eleven o'clock at night, in a camp in which
are reposing ten or eleven thousand men, as to give Monk and
Athos any alarm at his disappearance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "As it is so," said Monk,
"and we must have a light, a lantern, a torch, or something by
which we may see where to see our feet; let us seek this
light."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "General, the first soldier
we meet will light us."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No," said Monk, in order to
discover if there were not any connivance between the Comte de la
F&egrave;re and the fisherman.  "No, I should prefer one of these
French sailors who came this evening to sell me their fish.  They
leave to-morrow, and the secret will be better kept by them;
whereas, if a report should be spread in the Scottish army, that
treasures are to be found in the abbey of Newcastle, my
Highlanders will believe there is a million concealed beneath
every slab, and they will not leave stone upon stone in the
building."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do as you think best,
general," replied Athos, in a natural tone of voice, making
evident that soldier or fisherman was the same to him, and that
he had no preference.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk approached the causeway
behind which had disappeared the person he had taken for Digby,
and met a patrol who, making the tour of the tents, was going
towards headquarters; he was stopped with his companion, gave the
password, and went on.  A soldier, roused by the noise, unrolled
his plaid, and looked up to see what was going forward.  "Ask
him," said Monk to Athos, "where the fishermen are; if I were to
speak to him, he would know me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos went up to the
soldier, who pointed out the tent to him; immediately Monk and
Athos turned towards it.  It appeared to the general that at the
moment they came up, a shadow like that they had already seen,
glided into this tent; but on drawing nearer he perceived he must
have been mistaken, for all of them were asleep <i>p&ecirc;le
m&ecirc;le</i>, and nothing was seen but arms and legs joined,
crossed, and mixed.  Athos, fearing lest he should be suspected
of connivance with some of his compatriots, remained outside the
tent.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Hol&agrave;!</i>" said
Monk, in French, "wake up here."  Two or three of the sleepers
got up.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I want a man to light me,"
continued Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your honor may depend on
us," said a voice which made Athos start.  "Where do you wish us
to go?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You shall see.  A light!
come, quickly!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, your honor.  Does it
please your honor that I should accompany you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You or another; it is of
very little consequence, provided I have a light."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is strange!" thought
Athos; "what a singular voice that man has!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Some fire, you fellows!"
cried the fisherman; "come, make haste!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Then addressing his
companion nearest to him in a low voice: - "Get ready a light,
Menneville," said he, "and hold yourself ready for anything."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                One of the fishermen struck
light from a stone, set fire to some tinder, and by the aid of a
match lit a lantern.  The light immediately spread all over the
tent.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Are you ready, monsieur?"
said Monk to Athos, who had turned away, not to expose his face
to the light.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, general," replied
he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! the French gentleman!"
said the leader of the fishermen to himself.  "<i>Peste!</i>  I
have a great mind to charge you with the commission, Menneville;
he may know me.  Light! light!"  This dialogue was pronounced at
the back of the tent, and in so low a voice that Monk could not
hear a syllable of it; he was, besides, talking with Athos. 
Menneville got himself ready in the meantime, or rather received
the orders of his leader.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well?" said Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am ready, general," said
the fisherman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk, Athos, and the
fisherman left the tent.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is impossible!" thought
Athos.  "What dream could put that into my head?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Go forward; follow the
middle causeway, and stretch out your legs," said Monk to the
fisherman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                They were not twenty paces
on their way when the same shadow that had appeared to enter the
tent came out of it again, crawled along as far as the piles,
and, protected by that sort of parapet placed along the causeway,
carefully observed the march of the general.  All three
disappeared in the night haze.  They were walking towards
Newcastle, the white stones of which appeared to them like
sepulchers.  After standing for a few seconds under the porch,
they penetrated into the interior.  The door had been broken open
by hatchets.  A post of four men slept in safety in a corner, so
certain were they that the attack would not take place on that
side.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Will not these men be in
your way?" said Monk to Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "On the contrary, monsieur,
they will assist in rolling out the barrels, if your honor will
permit them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are right."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The post, though fast
asleep, roused up at the first steps of the three visitors
amongst the briars and grass that invaded the porch.  Monk gave
the password, and penetrated into the interior of the convent,
preceded by the light.  He walked last, watching the least
movement of Athos, his naked dirk in his sleeve, and ready to
plunge it into the back of the gentleman at the first suspicious
gesture he should see him make.  But Athos, with a firm and sure
step, crossed the chambers and courts.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Not a door, not a window was
left in the building.  The doors had been burnt, some on the
spot, and the charcoal of them was still jagged with the action
of the fire, which had gone out of itself, powerless, no doubt,
to get to the heart of those massive joints of oak fastened
together with iron nails.  As to the windows, all the panes
having been broken, night birds, alarmed by the torch, flew away
through their holes.  At the same time, gigantic bats began to
trace their vast, silent circles around the intruders, whilst the
light of the torch made their shadows tremble on the high stone
walls.  Monk concluded that there could be no man in the convent,
since wild beasts and birds were there still, and fled away at
his approach.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                After having passed the
rubbish, and torn away more than one branch of ivy that had made
itself a guardian of the solitude, Athos arrived at the vaults
situated beneath the great hall, but the entrance of which was
from the chapel.  There he stopped.  "Here we are, general," said
he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This, then, is the
slab?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ay, and here is the ring -
but the ring is sealed into the stone."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "We must have a lever."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That's a very easy thing to
find."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Whilst looking around them,
Athos and Monk perceived a little ash of about three inches in
diameter, which had shot up in an angle of the wall, reaching a
window, concealed by its branches.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Have you a knife?" said
Monk to the fisherman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Cut down this tree,
then."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The fisherman obeyed, but
not without notching his cutlass.  When the ash was cut and
fashioned into the shape of a lever, the three men penetrated
into the vault.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Stop where you are," said
Monk to the fisherman.  "We are going to dig up some powder; your
light may be dangerous."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The man drew back in a sort
of terror, and faithfully kept to the post assigned him, whilst
Monk and Athos turned behind a column at the foot of which,
penetrating through a crack, was a moonbeam, reflected exactly on
the stone which the Comte de la F&egrave;re had come so far in
search.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This is it," said Athos,
pointing out to the general the Latin inscription.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes," said Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Then, as if still willing to
leave the Frenchman one means of evasion, -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do you not observe that
this vault has already been broken into," continued he, "and that
several statues have already been knocked down?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord, you have, without
doubt, heard that the religious respect of your Scots loves to
confide to the statues of the dead the valuable objects they have
possessed during their lives.  Therefore, the soldiers had reason
to think that under the pedestals of the statues which ornament
most of these tombs, a treasure was hidden.  They have
consequently broken down pedestal and statue: but the tomb of the
venerable cannon, with which we have to do, is not distinguished
by any monument.  It is simple, therefore it has been protected
by superstitious the fear which your Puritans have always had of
sacrilege.  Not a morsel of the masonry of this tomb has been
chipped off."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is true," said
Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos seized the lever.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Shall I help you?" said
Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thank you, my lord; but I
am not willing that your honor should lend your hand to a work of
which, perhaps, you would not take the responsibility if you knew
the probable consequences of it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk raised his head.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What do you mean by that,
monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I mean - but that man -
"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Stop," said Monk; "I
perceive what you are afraid of.  I shall make a trial."  Monk
turned towards the fisherman, the whole of whose profile was
thrown upon the wall.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Come here, friend!" said he
in English, and in a tone of command.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The fisherman did not
stir.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is well," continued
he: "he does not know English.  Speak to me, then, in English, if
you please, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord," replied Athos, "I
have frequently seen men in certain circumstances have sufficient
command over themselves not to reply to a question put to them in
a language they understood.  The fisherman is perhaps more
learned than we believe him to be.  Send him away, my lord, I beg
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Decidedly," said Monk, "he
wishes to have me alone in this vault.  Never mind, we shall go
through with it; one man is as good as another man; and we are
alone.  My friend," said Monk to the fisherman, "go back up the
stairs we have just descended, and watch that nobody comes to
disturb us."  The fisherman made a sign of obedience.  "Leave
your torch," said Monk; "it would betray your presence, and might
procure you a musket-ball."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The fisherman appeared to
appreciate the counsel; he laid down the light, and disappeared
under the vault of the stairs.  Monk took up the torch, and
brought it to the foot of the column.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, ah!" said he; "money,
then, is concealed under this tomb?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, my lord; and in five
minutes you will no longer doubt it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                At the same time Athos
struck a violent blow upon the plaster, which split, presenting a
chink for the point of the lever.  Athos introduced the bar into
this crack, and soon large pieces of plaster yielded, rising up
like rounded slabs.  Then the Comte de la F&egrave;re seized the
stones and threw them away with a force that hands so delicate as
his might not have been supposed capable of having.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord," said Athos, "this
is plainly the masonry of which I told your honor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes; but I do not yet see
the casks," said Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "If I had a dagger," said
Athos, looking round him, "you should soon see them, monsieur. 
Unfortunately, I left mine in your tent."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I would willingly offer you
mine," said Monk, "but the blade is too thin for such work."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos appeared to look
around him for a thing of some kind that might serve as a
substitute for the weapon he desired.  Monk did not lose one of
the movements of his hands, or one of the expressions of his
eyes.  "Why do you not ask the fisherman for his cutlass?" said
Monk; "he has a cutlass."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! that is true," said
Athos; "for he cut the tree down with it."  And he advanced
towards the stairs.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Friend," said he to the
fisherman, "throw me down your cutlass, if you please; I want
it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The noise of the falling
weapon sounded on the steps.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Take it," said Monk; "it is
a solid instrument, as I have seen, and a strong hand might make
good use of it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos appeared only to give
to the words of Monk the natural and simple sense under which
they were to be heard and understood.  Nor did he remark, or at
least appear to remark, that when he returned with the weapon,
Monk drew back, placing his left hand on the stock of his pistol;
in the right he already held his dirk.  He went to work then,
turning his back to Monk, placing his life in his hands, without
possible defense.  He then struck, during several seconds, so
skillfully and sharply upon the intermediary plaster, that it
separated into two parts, and Monk was able to discern two
barrels placed end to end, and which their weight maintained
motionless in their chalky envelope.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord," said Athos, "you
see that my presentiments have not been disappointed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur," said Monk,
"and I have good reason to believe you are satisfied; are you
not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Doubtless I am; the loss of
this money would have been inexpressibly great to me: but I was
certain that God, who protects the good cause, would not have
permitted this gold, which should procure its triumph, to be
diverted to baser purposes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are, upon my honor, as
mysterious in your words as in your actions, monsieur," said
Monk.  "Just now as I did not perfectly understand you when you
said that you were not willing to throw upon me the
responsibility of the work we were accomplishing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I had reason to say so, my
lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And now you speak to me of
the good cause.  What do you mean by the words 'the good cause?' 
We are defending at this moment, in England, five or six causes,
which does not prevent every one from considering his own not
only as the good cause, but as the best.  What is yours,
monsieur?  Speak boldly, that we may see if, upon this point, to
which you appear to attach a great importance, we are of the same
opinion."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos fixed upon Monk one of
those penetrating looks which seemed to convey to him to whom
they are directed a challenge to conceal a single one of his
thoughts; then, taking off his hat, he began in a solemn voice,
while his interlocutor, with one hand upon his visage, allowed
that long and nervous hand to compress his mustache and beard,
while his vague and melancholy eye wandered about the recesses of
the vaults.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>"M</span>y lord,"
said the Comte de la F&egrave;re, "you are an noble Englishman,
you are a loyal man; you are speaking to a noble Frenchman, to a
man of heart.  The gold contained in these two casks before us, I
have told you was mine.  I was wrong - it is the first lie I have
pronounced in my life, a temporary lie, it is true.  This gold is
the property of King Charles II., exiled from his country, driven
from his palaces, the orphan at once of his father and his
throne, and deprived of everything, even of the melancholy
happiness of kissing on his knees the stone upon which the hands
of his murderers have written that simple epitaph which will
eternally cry out for vengeance upon them: -'HERE LIES CHARLES
I.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk grew slightly pale, and
an imperceptible shudder crept over his skin and raised his gray
mustache.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I," continued Athos, "I,
Comte de la F&egrave;re, the last, only faithful friend the poor
abandoned prince has left, I have offered him to come hither to
find the man upon whom now depends the fate of royalty and of
England; and I have come, and placed myself under the eye of this
man, and have placed myself naked and unarmed in his hands,
saying: - 'My lord, here are the last resources of a prince whom
God made your master, whom his birth made your king; upon you,
and you alone, depend his life and future.  Will you employ this
money in consoling England for the evils it must have suffered
from anarchy; that is to say, will you aid, and if not aid, will
you allow King Charles II. to act?  You are master, you are king,
all-powerful master and king, for chance sometimes defeats the
work of time and God.  I am here alone with you, my lord: if
divided success alarms you, if my complicity annoys you, you are
armed, my lord, and here is a grave ready dug; if, on the
contrary, the enthusiasm of your cause carries you away, if you
are what you appear to be, if your hand in what it undertakes
obeys your mind, and your mind your heart, here are the means of
ruining forever the cause of your enemy, Charles Stuart.  Kill,
then, the man you have before you, for that man will never return
to him who has sent him without bearing with him the deposit
which Charles I., his father, confided to him, and keep the gold
which may assist in carrying on the civil war.  Alas! my lord, it
is the fate of this unfortunate prince.  He must either corrupt
or kill, for everything resists him, everything repulses him,
everything is hostile to him; and yet he is marked with divine
seal, and he must, not to belie his blood, reascend the throne,
or die upon the sacred soil of his country.'</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord, you have heard
me.  To any other but the illustrious man who listens to me, I
would have said: 'My lord, you are poor; my lord, the king offers
you this million as an earnest of an immense bargain; take it,
and serve Charles II. as I served Charles I., and I feel assured
that God, who listens to us, who sees us, who alone reads in your
heart, shut up from all human eyes, - I am assured God will give
you a happy eternal life after death.'  But to General Monk, to
the illustrious man of whose standard I believe I have taken
measure, I say: 'My lord, there is for you in the history of
peoples and kings a brilliant place, an immortal, imperishable
glory, if alone, without any other interest but the good of your
country and the interests of justice, you become the supporter of
your king.  Many others have been conquerors and glorious
usurpers; you, my lord, you will be content with being the most
virtuous, the most honest, and the most incorruptible of men: you
will have held a crown in your hand, and instead of placing it
upon your own brow, you will have deposited it upon the head of
him for whom it was made.  Oh, my lord, act thus, and you will
leave to posterity the most enviable of names, in which no human
creature can rival you.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos stopped.  During the
whole time that the noble gentleman was speaking, Monk had not
given one sign of either approbation or disapprobation; scarcely
even, during this vehement appeal, had his eyes been animated
with that fire which bespeaks intelligence.  The Comte de la
F&egrave;re looked at him sorrowfully, and on seeing that
melancholy countenance, felt discouragement penetrate to his very
heart.  At length Monk appeared to recover, and broke the
silence.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," said he, in a
mild, calm tone, "in reply to you, I will make use of your own
words.  To any other but yourself I would reply by expulsion,
imprisonment, or still worse, for, in fact, you tempt me and you
force me at the same time.  But you are one of those men,
monsieur, to whom it is impossible to refuse the attention and
respect they merit; you are a brave gentleman, monsieur - I say
so, and I am a judge.  You just now spoke of a deposit which the
late king transmitted through you to his son - are you, then, one
of those Frenchmen who, as I have heard, endeavored to carry off
Charles I. from Whitehall?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, my lord; it was I who
was beneath the scaffold during the execution; I, who had not
been able to redeem it, received upon my brow the blood of the
martyred king.  I received, at the same time, the last word of
Charles I.; it was to me he said, 'REMEMBER!' and in saying,
'Remember!' he alluded to the money at your feet, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have heard much of you,
monsieur," said Monk, "but I am happy to have, in the first
place, appreciated you by my own observations, and not by my
remembrances.  I will give you, then, explanations that I have
given to no other, and you will appreciate what a distinction I
make between you and the persons who have hitherto been sent to
me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos bowed and prepared to
absorb greedily the words which fell, one by one, from the mouth
of Monk, - those words rare and precious as the dew in the
desert.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You spoke to me," said
Monk, "of Charles II.; but pray, monsieur, of what consequence to
me is that phantom of a king?  I have grown old in a war and in a
policy which are nowadays so closely linked together, that every
man of the sword must fight in virtue of his rights or his
ambition with a personal interest, and not blindly behind an
officer, as in ordinary wars.  For myself, I perhaps desire
nothing, but I fear much.  In the war of to-day rests the liberty
of England, and, perhaps, that of every Englishman.  How can you
expect that I, free in the position I have made for myself,
should go willingly and hold out my hands to the shackles of a
stranger?  That is all Charles is to me.  He has fought battles
here which he has lost, he is therefore a bad captain; he has
succeeded in no negotiation, he is therefore a bad diplomatist;
he has paraded his wants and his miseries in all the courts of
Europe, he has therefore a weak and pusillanimous heart.  Nothing
noble, nothing great, nothing strong has hitherto emanated from
that genius which aspires to govern one of the greatest kingdoms
of the earth.  I know this Charles, then, under none but bad
aspects, and you would wish me, a man of good sense, to go and
make myself gratuitously the slave of a creature who is inferior
to me in military capacity, in politics, and in dignity!  No,
monsieur.  When some great and noble action shall have taught me
to value Charles, I shall perhaps recognize his rights to a
throne from which we cast the father because he wanted the
virtues which his son has hitherto lacked, but, in fact of
rights, I only recognize my own; the revolution made me a
general, my sword will make me protector, if I wish it.  Let
Charles show himself, let him present himself, let him enter the
competition open to genius, and, above all, let him remember that
he is of a race from whom more will be expected than from any
other.  Therefore, monsieur, say no more about him.  I neither
refuse nor accept: I reserve myself - I wait."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos knew Monk to be too
well informed of all concerning Charles to venture to urge the
discussion further; it was neither the time nor the place.  "My
lord," then said he, "I have nothing to do but thank you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And why, monsieur?  Because
you have formed a correct opinion of me, or because I have acted
according to your judgment?  Is that, in truth, worthy of
thanks?  This gold which you are about to carry to Charles will
serve me as a test for him, by seeing the use he will make of
it.  I shall have an opinion which now I have not."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And yet does not your honor
fear to compromise yourself by allowing such a sum to be carried
away for the service of your enemy?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My enemy, say you?  Eh,
monsieur, I have no enemies.  I am in the service of the
parliament, which orders me to fight General Lambert and Charles
Stuart - its enemies, and not mine.  I fight them.  If the
parliament, on the contrary, ordered me to unfurl my standards on
the port of London, and to assemble my soldiers on the banks to
receive Charles II. - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You would obey?" cried
Athos, joyfully.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Pardon me," said Monk,
smiling, "I was going on - I, a gray-headed man - in truth, how
could I forget myself? was going to speak like a foolish young
man."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then you would not obey?"
said Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I do not say that either,
monsieur.  The welfare of my country before everything.  God, who
has given me the power, has, no doubt, willed that I should have
that power for the good of all, and He has given me, at the same
time, discernment.  If the parliament were to order such a thing,
I should reflect."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The brow of Athos became
clouded.  "Then I may positively say that your honor is not
inclined to favor King Charles II.?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You continue to question
me, monsieur le comte; allow me to do so in turn, if you
please."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do, monsieur; and may God
inspire you with the idea of replying to me as frankly as I shall
reply to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "When you shall have taken
this money back to your prince, what advice will you give
him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos fixed upon Monk a
proud and resolute look.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord," said he, "with
this million, which others would perhaps employ in negotiating, I
would advise the king to rise two regiments, to enter Scotland,
which you have just pacified: to give to the people the
franchises which the revolution promised them, and in which it
has not, in all cases, kept its word.  I should advise him to
command in person this little army, which would, believe me,
increase, and to die, standard in hand, and sword in sheath,
saying, 'Englishmen!  I am the third king of my race you have
killed; beware of the justice of God!'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk hung down his head, and
mused for an instant.  "If he succeeded," said he, "which is very
improbable, but not impossible - for everything is possible in
this world - what would you advise him to do?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To think that by the will
of God he lost his crown, by the good will of men he recovered
it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                An ironical smile passed
over the lips of Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Unfortunately, monsieur,"
said he, "kings do not know how to follow good advice."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, my lord, Charles II. is
not a king," replied Athos, smiling in his turn, but with a very
different expression from Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Let us terminate this,
monsieur le comte, - that is your desire, is it not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos bowed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I shall give orders to have
these two casks transported whither you please.  Where are you
lodging, monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In a little hamlet at the
mouth of the river, your honor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, I know the hamlet; it
consists of five or six houses, does it not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Exactly.  Well, I inhabit
the first, - two net-makers occupy it with me; it is their bark
which brought me ashore."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But your own vessel,
monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My vessel is at anchor, a
quarter of a mile at sea, and waits for me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You do not think, however,
of setting out immediately?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord, I shall try once
more to convince your honor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You will not succeed,"
replied Monk; "but it is of consequence that you should depart
from Newcastle without leaving of your passage the least
suspicion that might prove injurious to me or you.  To-morrow my
officers think Lambert will attack me.  I, on the contrary, am
convinced he will not stir; it is in my opinion impossible. 
Lambert leads an army devoid of homogeneous principles, and there
is no possible army with such elements.  I have taught my
soldiers to consider my authority subordinate to another,
therefore, after me, round me, and beneath me, they still look
for something.  It would result that if I were dead, whatever
might happen, my army would not be demoralized all at once; it
results, that if I choose to absent myself, for instance, as it
does please me to do sometimes, there would not be in the camp
the shadow of uneasiness or disorder.  I am the magnet - the
sympathetic and natural strength of the English.  All those
scattered irons that will be sent against me I shall attract to
myself.  Lambert, at this moment, commands eighteen thousand
deserters; but I have never mentioned that to my officers, you
may easily suppose.  Nothing is more useful to an army than the
expectation of a coming battle; everybody is awake - everybody is
on guard.  I tell you this that you may live in perfect
security.  Do not be in a hurry, then, to cross the seas; within
a week there will be something fresh, either a battle or an
accommodation.  Then, as you have judged me to be an honorable
man, and confided your secret to me, I have to thank you for this
confidence, and I shall come and pay you a visit or send for
you.  Do not go before I send word.  I repeat the request."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I promise you, general,"
cried Athos, with a joy so great, that in spite of all his
circumspection, he could not prevent its sparkling in his
eyes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk surprised this flash,
and immediately extinguished it by one of those silent smiles
which always caused his interlocutors to know they had made no
inroad on his mind.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then, my lord, it is a week
that you desire me to wait?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A week? yes, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And during those days what
shall I do?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "If there should be a
battle, keep at a distance from it, I beseech you.  I know the
French delight in such amusements; - you might take a fancy to
see how we fight, and you might receive some chance shot.  Our
Scotsmen are very bad marksmen, and I do not wish that a worthy
gentleman like you should return to France wounded.  Nor should I
like to be obliged, myself, to send to your prince his million
left here by you; for then it would be said, and with some
reason, that I paid the Pretender to enable him to make war
against the parliament.  Go, then, monsieur, and let it be done
as has been agreed upon."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, my lord," said Athos,
"what joy it would give me to be the first that penetrated to the
noble heart which beats beneath that cloak!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You think, then, that I
have secrets," said Monk, without changing the half cheerful
expression of his countenance.  "Why, monsieur, what secret can
you expect to find in the hollow head of a soldier?  But it is
getting late, and our torch is almost out; let us call our
man."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Hol&agrave;!</i>" cried
Monk in French, approaching the stairs; "<i>hol&agrave;!</i>
fisherman!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The fisherman, benumbed by
the cold night air, replied in a hoarse voice, asking what they
wanted of him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Go to the post," said Monk,
"and order a sergeant, in the name of General Monk, to come here
immediately."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This was a commission easily
performed; for the sergeant, uneasy at the general's being in
that desolate abbey, had drawn nearer by degrees, and was not
much further off than the fisherman.  The general's order was
therefore heard by him, and he hastened to obey it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Get a horse and two men,"
said Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A horse and two men?"
repeated the sergeant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes," replied Monk.  "Have
you got any means of getting a horse with a pack-saddle or two
panniers?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No doubt, at a hundred
paces off, in the Scottish camp."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very well."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What shall I do with the
horse, general."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Look here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The sergeant descended the
three steps which separated him from Monk, and came into the
vault.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You see," said Monk, "that
gentleman yonder?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, general."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you see these two
casks?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Perfectly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "They are two casks, one
containing powder, and the other balls; I wish these casks to be
transported to the little hamlet at the mouth of the river, and
which I intend to occupy to-morrow with two hundred muskets.  You
understand that the commission is a secret one, for it is a
movement that may decide the fate of the battle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, general!" murmured the
sergeant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Mind, then!  Let these
casks be fastened on to the horse, and let them be escorted by
two men and you to the residence of this gentleman, who is my
friend.  But take care that nobody knows it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I would go by the marsh if
I knew the road," said the sergeant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I know one myself," said
Athos; "it is not wide, but it is solid, having been made upon
piles; and with care we shall get over safely enough."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do everything this
gentleman shall order you to do."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! oh! the casks are
heavy," said the sergeant, trying to lift one.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "They weigh four hundred
pounds each, if they contain what they ought to contain, do they
not, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thereabouts," said
Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The sergeant went in search
of the two men and the horse.  Monk, left alone with Athos,
affected to speak to him on nothing but indifferent subjects
while examining the vault in a cursory manner.  Then, hearing the
horse's steps, -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I leave you with your men,
monsieur," said he, "and return to the camp.  You are perfectly
safe."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I shall see you again,
then, my lord?" asked Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is agreed upon,
monsieur, and with much pleasure."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk held out his hand to
Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! my lord, if you would!"
murmured Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Hush! monsieur, it is
agreed that we shall speak no more of that."  And bowing to
Athos, he went up the stairs, meeting about half-way his men, who
were coming down.  He had not gone twenty paces, when a faint but
prolonged whistle was heard at a distance.  Monk listened, but
seeing nothing and hearing nothing, he continued his route.  Then
he remembered the fisherman, and looked about for him; but the
fisherman had disappeared.  If he had, however, looked with more
attention, he might have seen that man, bent double, gliding like
a serpent along the stones and losing himself in the mist that
floated over the surface of the marsh.  He might equally have
seen, had he attempted to pierce that mist, a spectacle that
might have attracted his attention; and that was the rigging of
the vessel, which had changed place, and was now nearer the
shore.  But Monk saw nothing; and thinking he had nothing to
fear, he entered the deserted causeway which led to his camp.  It
was then that the disappearance of the fisherman appeared
strange, and that a real suspicion began to take possession of
his mind.  He had just placed at the orders of Athos the only
post that could protect him.  He had a mile of causeway to
traverse before he could regain his camp.  The fog increased with
such intensity that he could scarcely distinguish objects at ten
paces' distance.  Monk then thought he heard the sound of an oar
over the marsh on the right.  "Who goes there?" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                But nobody answered; then he
cocked his pistol, took his sword in his hand, and quickened his
pace, without, however, being willing to call anybody.  Such a
summons, for which there was no absolute necessity, appeared
unworthy of him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>I</span>t was seven
o'clock in the morning, the first rays of day lightened the pools
of the marsh, in which the sun was reflected like a red ball,
when Athos, awakening and opening the window of his bed-chamber,
which looked out upon the banks of the river, perceived, at
fifteen paces' distance from him, the sergeant and the men who
had accompanied him the evening before, and who, after having
deposited the casks at his house, had returned to the camp by the
causeway on the right.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Why had these men come back
after having returned to the camp?  That was the question which
first presented itself to Athos.  The sergeant, with his head
raised, appeared to be watching the moment when the gentleman
should appear to address him.  Athos, surprised to see these men,
whom he had seen depart the night before, could not refrain from
expressing his astonishment to them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "There is nothing surprising
in that, monsieur," said the sergeant; "for yesterday the general
commanded me to watch over your safety, and I thought it right to
obey that order."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is the general at the
camp?" asked Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No doubt he is, monsieur;
as when he left you he was going back."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, wait for me a moment;
I am going thither to render an account of the fidelity with
which you fulfilled your duty, and to get my sword, which I left
upon the table in the tent."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This happens very well,"
said the sergeant, "for we were about to request you to do
so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos fancied he could
detect an air of equivocal <i>bonhomie</i> upon the countenance
of the sergeant; but the adventure of the vault might have
excited the curiosity of the man, and it was not surprising that
he allowed some of the feelings which agitated his mind to appear
in his face.  Athos closed the doors carefully, confiding the
keys to Grimaud, who had chosen his domicile beneath the shed
itself, which led to the cellar where the casks had been
deposited.  The sergeant escorted the Comte de la F&egrave;re to
the camp.  There a fresh guard awaited him, and relieved the four
men who had conducted Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This fresh guard was
commanded by the aid-de-camp Digby, who, on their way, fixed upon
Athos looks so little encouraging, that the Frenchman asked
himself whence arose, with regard to him, this vigilance and this
severity, when the evening before he had been left perfectly
free.  He nevertheless continued his way to the headquarters,
keeping to himself the observations which men and things forced
him to make.  He found in the general's tent, to which he had
been introduced the evening before, three superior officers:
these were Monk's lieutenant and two colonels.  Athos perceived
his sword; it was still on the table where he left it.  Neither
of the officers had seen Athos, consequently neither of them knew
him.  Monk's lieutenant asked, at the appearance of Athos, if
that were the same gentleman with whom the general had left the
tent.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, your honor," said the
sergeant; "it is the same."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But," said Athos,
haughtily, "I do not deny it, I think; and now, gentlemen, in
turn, permit me to ask you to what purpose these questions are
asked, and particularly some explanations upon the tone in which
you ask them?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," said the
lieutenant, "if we address these questions to you, it is because
we have a right to do so, and if we make them in a particular
tone, it is because that tone, believe me, agrees with the
circumstances."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Gentlemen," said Athos,
"you do not know who I am; but I must tell you that I acknowledge
no one here but General Monk as my equal.  Where is he?  Let me
be conducted to him, and if he has any questions to put to me, I
will answer him and to his satisfaction, I hope.  I repeat,
gentlemen, where is the general?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eh! good God! you know
better than we do where he is," said the lieutenant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," said Athos; "I
do not understand you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You will understand me -
and, in the first place, do not speak so loudly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos smiled
disdainfully.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "We don't ask you to smile,"
said one of the colonels warmly; "we require you to answer."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And I, gentlemen, declare
to you that I will not reply until I am in the presence of the
general."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But," replied the same
colonel who had already spoken, "you know very well that is
impossible."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This is the second time I
have received this strange reply to the wish I express," said
Athos.  "Is the general absent?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This question was made with
such apparent good faith, and the gentleman wore an air of such
natural surprise, that the three officers exchanged a meaning
look.  The lieutenant, by a tacit convention with the other two,
was spokesman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, the general left
you last night on the borders of the monastery."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you went - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is not for me to answer
you, but for those who have accompanied me.  They were your
soldiers, ask them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But if we please to
question you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then it will please me to
reply, monsieur, that I do not recognize any one here, that I
know no one here but the general, and that it is to him alone I
will reply."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So be it, monsieur; but as
we are the masters, we constitute ourselves a council of war, and
when you are before judges you must reply."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The countenance of Athos
expressed nothing but astonishment and disdain, instead of the
terror the officers expected to read in it at this threat.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Scottish or English judges
upon me, a subject of the king of France; upon me, placed under
the safeguard of British honor!  You are mad, gentlemen!" said
Athos, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The officers looked at each
other.  "Then, monsieur," said one of them, "do you pretend not
to know where the general is?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To that, monsieur, I have
already replied."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, but you have already
replied an incredible thing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is true, nevertheless,
gentlemen.  Men of my rank are not generally liars.  I am a
gentleman, I have told you, and when I have at my side the sword
which, by an excess of delicacy, I left last night upon the table
whereon it still lies, believe me, no man says that to me which I
am unwilling to hear.  I am at this moment disarmed; if you
pretend to be my judges, try me; if you are but my executioners,
kill me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But, monsieur - " asked the
lieutenant, in a more courteous voice, struck with the lofty
coolness of Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sir, I came to speak
confidentially with your general about affairs of importance.  It
was not an ordinary welcome that he gave me.  The accounts your
soldiers can give you may convince you of that.  If, then, the
general received me in that manner, he knew my titles to his
esteem.  Now, you do not suspect, I should think, that I should
reveal my secrets to you, and still less his."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But these casks, what do
they contain?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Have you not put that
question to your soldiers?  What was their reply?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That they contained powder
and ball."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "From whom had they that
information?  They must have told you that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "From the general; but we
are not dupes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Beware, gentlemen; it is
not to me you are now giving the lie, it is to your leader."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The officers again looked at
each other.  Athos continued: "Before your soldiers the general
told me to wait a week, and at the expiration of that week he
would give me the answer he had to make me.  Have I fled away? 
No; I wait."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He told you to wait a
week!" cried the lieutenant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He told me that so clearly,
sir, that I have a sloop at the mouth of the river, which I could
with ease have joined yesterday, and embarked.  Now, if I have
remained, it was only in compliance with the desire of your
general; his honor having requested me not to depart without a
last audience, which he fixed at a week hence.  I repeat to you,
then, I am waiting."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The lieutenant turned
towards the other officers, and said, in a low voice: "If this
gentleman speaks truth, there may still be some hope.  The
general may be carrying out some negotiations so secret, that he
thought it imprudent to inform even us.  Then the time limited
for his absence would be a week."  Then, turning towards Athos:
"Monsieur," said he, "your declaration is of the most serious
importance; are you willing to repeat it under the seal of an
oath?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sir," replied Athos, "I
have always lived in a world where my simple word was regarded as
the most sacred of oaths."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This time, however,
monsieur, the circumstance is more grave than any you may have
been placed in.  The safety of the whole army is at stake. 
Reflect; the general has disappeared, and our search for him has
been in vain.  Is this disappearance natural?  Has a crime been
committed?  Are we not bound to carry our investigations to
extremity?  Have we any right to wait with patience?  At this
moment, everything, monsieur, depends upon the words you are
about to pronounce."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thus questioned, gentlemen,
I no longer hesitate," said Athos.  "Yes, I came hither to
converse confidentially with General Monk, and ask him for an
answer regarding certain interests; yes, the general being,
doubtless, unable to pronounce before the expected battle, begged
me to remain a week in the house I inhabit, promising me that in
a week I should see him again.  Yes, all this is true, and I
swear it by God who is the absolute master of my life and
yours."  Athos pronounced these words with so much grandeur and
solemnity, that the three officers were almost convinced. 
Nevertheless, one of the colonels made a last attempt.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," said he,
"although we may now be persuaded of the truth of what you say,
there is yet a strange mystery in all this.  The general is too
prudent a man to have thus abandoned his army on the eve of a
battle without having at least given notice of it to one of us. 
As for myself, I cannot believe but some strange event has been
the cause of this disappearance.  Yesterday some foreign
fishermen came to sell their fish here; they were lodged yonder
among the Scots; that is to say, on the road the general took
with this gentleman, to go to the abbey, and to return from it. 
It was one of these fishermen that accompanied the general with a
light.  And this morning, bark and fishermen have all
disappeared, carried away by the night's tide."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "For my part," said the
lieutenant, "I see nothing in that that is not quite natural, for
these people were not prisoners."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No; but I repeat it was one
of them who lighted the general and this gentleman to the abbey,
and Digby assures us that the general had strong suspicions
concerning those people.  Now, who can say whether these people
were not connected with this gentleman; and that, the blow being
struck, the gentleman, who is evidently brave, did not remain to
reassure us by his presence, and to prevent our researches being
made in a right direction?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This speech made an
impression upon the other two officers.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sir," said Athos, "permit
me to tell you, that your reasoning, though specious in
appearance, nevertheless wants consistency, as regards me.  I
have remained, you say, to divert suspicion.  Well! on the
contrary, suspicions arise in me as well as in you; and I say, it
is impossible, gentlemen, that the general, on the eve of a
battle, should leave his army without saying anything to at least
one of his officers.  Yes, there is some strange event connected
with this; instead of being idle and waiting, you must display
all the activity and all the vigilance possible.  I am your
prisoner, gentlemen, upon parole or otherwise.  My honor is
concerned in ascertaining what has become of General Monk, and to
such a point, that if you were to say to me, 'Depart!'  I should
reply: 'No, I will remain!'  And if you were to ask my opinion, I
should add:  'Yes, the general is the victim of some conspiracy,
for, if he had intended to leave the camp he would have told me
so.'  Seek, then, search the land, search the sea; the general
has not gone of his own good will."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The lieutenant made a sign
to the two other officers.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, monsieur," said he,
"no; in your turn you go too far.  The general has nothing to
suffer from these events, and, no doubt, has directed them.  What
Monk is now doing he has often done before.  We are wrong in
alarming ourselves; his absence will, doubtless, be of short
duration; therefore, let us beware, lest by a pusillanimity which
the general would consider a crime, of making his absence public,
and by that means demoralize the army.  The general gives a
striking proof of his confidence in us; let us show ourselves
worthy of it.  Gentlemen, let the most profound silence cover all
this with an impenetrable veil; we will detain this gentleman,
not from mistrust of him with regard to the crime, but to assure
more effectively the secret of the general's absence by keeping
among ourselves; therefore, until fresh orders, the gentleman
will remain at headquarters."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Gentlemen," said Athos,
"you forget that last night the general confided to me a deposit
over which I am bound to watch.  Give me whatever guard you like,
chain me if you like, but leave me the house I inhabit for my
prison.  The general, on his return, would reproach you, I swear
on the honor of a gentleman, for having displeased him in
this."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So be it, monsieur," said
the lieutenant; "return to your abode."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Then they placed over Athos
a guard of fifty men, who surrounded his house, without losing
sight of him for a minute.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The secret remained secure,
but hours, days passed away without the general's returning, or
without anything being heard of him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>T</span>wo days after
the events we have just related, and while General Monk was
expected every minute in the camp to which he did not return, a
little Dutch <i>felucca</i>, manned by eleven men, cast anchor
upon the coast of Scheveningen, nearly within cannon-shot of the
port.  It was night, the darkness was great, the tide rose in the
darkness; it was a capital time to land passengers and
merchandise.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The road of Scheveningen
forms a vast crescent; it is not very deep and not very safe;
therefore, nothing is seen stationed there but large Flemish
hoys, or some of those Dutch barks which fishermen draw up on the
sand on rollers, as the ancients did, according to Virgil.  When
the tide is rising, and advancing on land, it is not prudent to
bring the vessels too close in shore, for, if the wind is fresh,
the prows are buried in the sand; and the sand of that coast is
spongy; it receives easily, but does not yield so well.  It was
on this account, no doubt, that a boat was detached from the
bark, as soon as the latter had cast anchor, and came with eight
sailors, amidst whom was to be seen an object of an oblong form,
a sort of large pannier or bale.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The shore was deserted; the
few fishermen inhabiting the down were gone to bed.  The only
sentinel that guarded the coast (a coast very badly guarded,
seeing that a landing from large ships was impossible), without
having been able to follow the example of the fishermen, who were
gone to bed, imitated them so far, that he slept at the back of
his watch-box as soundly as they slept in their beds.  The only
noise to be heard, then, was the whistling of the night breeze
among the bushes and the brambles of the downs.  But the people
who were approaching were doubtless mistrustful people, for this
real silence and apparent solitude did not satisfy them.  Their
boat, therefore, scarcely as visible as a dark speck upon the
ocean, gilded along noiselessly, avoiding the use of their oars
for fear of being heard, and gained the nearest land.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Scarcely had it touched the
ground when a single man jumped out of the boat, after having
given a brief order, in a manner which denoted the habit of
commanding.  In consequence of this order, several muskets
immediately glittered in the feeble light reflected from that
mirror of the heavens, the sea; and the oblong bale of which we
spoke, containing no doubt some contraband object, was
transported to land, with infinite precautions.  Immediately
after that, the man who had landed first, set off at a rapid pace
diagonally towards the village of Scheveningen, directing his
course to the nearest point of the wood.  When there, he sought
for that house already described as the temporary residence - and
a very humble residence - of him who was styled by courtesy king
of England.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                All were asleep there, as
everywhere else, only a large dog, of the race of those which the
fishermen of Scheveningen harness to little carts to carry fish
to the Hague, began to bark formidably as soon as the stranger's
steps were audible beneath the windows.  But the watchfulness,
instead of alarming the newly-landed man, appeared, on the
contrary, to give him great joy, for his voice might perhaps have
proved insufficient to rouse the people of the house, whilst,
with an auxiliary of that sort, his voice became almost useless. 
The stranger waited, then, till these reiterated and sonorous
barkings should, according to all probability, have produced
their effect, and then he ventured a summons.  On hearing his
voice, the dog began to roar with such violence that another
voice was soon heard from the interior, quieting the dog.  With
that the dog was quieted.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What do you want?" asked
that voice, at the same time weak, broken, and civil.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I want his majesty King
Charles II., king of England," said the stranger.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What do you want with
him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I want to speak with
him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who are you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah!  <i>Mordioux!</i> you
ask too much; I don't like talking through doors."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Only tell me your
name."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I don't like to declare my
name in the open air, either; besides, you may be sure I shall
not eat your dog, and I hope to God he will be as reserved with
respect to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You bring news, perhaps,
monsieur, do you not?" replied the voice, patient and querulous
as that of an old man.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I will answer for it, I
bring you news you little expect.  Open the door, then, if you
please, <i>hein!</i>"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," persisted the
old man, "do you believe, upon your soul and conscience, that
your news is worth waking the king?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "For God's sake, my dear
monsieur, draw your bolts; you will not be sorry, I swear, for
the trouble it will give you.  I am worth my weight in gold,
<i>parole d'honneur!</i>"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, I cannot open the
door till you have told me your name."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Must I, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is by the order of my
master, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, my name is - but, I
warn you, my name will tell you absolutely nothing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Never mind, tell it,
notwithstanding."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, I am the Chevalier
d'Artagnan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The voice uttered an
exclamation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! good heavens!" said a
voice on the other side of the door.  "Monsieur d'Artagnan.  What
happiness!  I could not help thinking I knew that voice."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Humph!" said D'Artagnan. 
"My voice is known here!  That's flattering."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! yes, we know it," said
the old man, drawing the bolts; "and here is the proof."  And at
these words he let in D'Artagnan, who, by the light of the
lantern he carried in his hand, recognized his obstinate
interlocutor.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! <i> Mordioux!</i>"
cried he: "why, it is Parry!  I ought to have known that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Parry, yes, my dear
Monsieur d'Artagnan, it is I.  What joy to see you once
again!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are right there, what
joy!" said D'Artagnan, pressing the old man's hand.  "There, now
you'll go and inform the king, will you not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But the king is asleep, my
dear monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Mordioux!</i> then wake
him.  He won't scold you for having disturbed him, I will promise
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You come on the part of the
count, do you not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The Comte de la
F&egrave;re?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "From Athos?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Ma foi!</i> no; I come
on my own part.  Come, Parry, quick!  The king - I want the
king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Parry did not think it his
duty to resist any longer; he knew D'Artagnan of old; he knew
that, although a Gascon, his words never promised more than they
could stand to.  He crossed a court and a little garden, appeased
the dog, that seemed most anxious to taste of the musketeer's
flesh, and went to knock at the window of a chamber forming the
ground-floor of a little pavilion.  Immediately a little dog
inhabiting that chamber replied to the great dog inhabiting the
court.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Poor king!" said D'Artagnan
to himself, "these are his body-guards.  It is true he is not the
worse guarded on that account."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What is wanted with me?"
asked the king, from the back of the chamber.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, it is M. le Chevalier
d'Artagnan, who brings you some news."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                A noise was immediately
heard in the chamber, a door was opened, and a flood of light
inundated the corridor and the garden.  The king was working by
the light of a lamp.  Papers were lying about upon his desk, and
he had commenced the first copy of a letter which showed, by the
numerous erasures, the trouble he had had in writing it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Come in, monsieur le
chevalier," said he, turning around.  Then perceiving the
fisherman, "What do you mean, Parry?  Where is M. le Chevalier
d'Artagnan?" asked Charles.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He is before you, sire,"
said M. d'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What, in that costume?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes; look at me, sire; do
you not remember having seen me at Blois, in the ante-chamber of
King Louis XIV.?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur, and I
remember I was much pleased with you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan bowed.  "It was
my duty to behave as I did, the moment I knew that I had the
honor of being near your majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You bring me news, do you
say?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "From the king of
France?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Ma foi!</i> no, sire,"
replied D'Artagnan.  "Your majesty must have seen yonder that the
king of France is only occupied with his own majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Charles raised his eyes
towards heaven.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, sire, no," continued
D'Artagnan.  "I bring news entirely composed of personal facts. 
Nevertheless, I hope that your majesty will listen to the facts
and news with some favor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Speak, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "If I am not mistaken, sire,
your majesty spoke a great deal at Blois, of the embarrassed
state in which the affairs of England are."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Charles colored. 
"Monsieur," said he, "it was to the king of France I related -
"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! your majesty is
mistaken," said the musketeer, coolly; "I know how to speak to
kings in misfortune.  It is only when they are in misfortune that
they speak to me; once fortunate, they look upon me no more.  I
have, then, for your majesty, not only the greatest respect, but,
still more, the most absolute devotion; and that, believe me,
with me, sire, means something.  Now, hearing your majesty
complain of fate, I found that you were noble and generous, and
bore misfortune well."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In truth!" said Charles,
much astonished, "I do not know which I ought to prefer, your
freedoms or your respects."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You will choose presently,
sire," said D'Artagnan.  "Then your majesty complained to your
brother, Louis XIV., of the difficulty you experienced in
returning to England and regaining your throne for want of men
and money."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Charles allowed a movement
of impatience to escape him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And the principal object
your majesty found in your way," continued D'Artagnan, "was a
certain general commanding the armies of the parliament, and who
was playing yonder the part of another Cromwell.  Did not your
majesty say so?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes; but I repeat to you,
monsieur, those words were for the king's ears alone."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you will see, sire,
that it is very fortunate that they fell into those of his
lieutenant of musketeers.  That man so troublesome to your
majesty was one General Monk, I believe; did I not hear his name
correctly, sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur, but once
more, to what purpose are all these questions."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!  I know very well,
sire, that etiquette will not allow kings to be questioned.  I
hope, however, presently you will pardon my want of etiquette. 
Your majesty added that, notwithstanding, if you could see him,
confer with him, and meet him face to face, you would triumph,
either by force or persuasion, over that obstacle - the only
serious one, the only insurmountable one, the only real one you
met with on your road."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "All that is true, monsieur:
my destiny, my future, my obscurity, or my glory depend upon that
man; but what do you draw from that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "One thing alone, that if
this General Monk is troublesome to the point your majesty
describes, it would be expedient to get rid of him or make an
ally of him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, a king who has
neither army nor money, as you have heard my conversation with my
brother Louis, has no means of acting against a man like
Monk."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire, that was your
opinion, I know very well: but, fortunately for you, it was not
mine."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What do you mean by
that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That, without an army and
without a million, I have done - I, myself - what your majesty
thought could alone be done with an army and a million."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How!  What do you say? 
What have you done?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What have I done?  Eh!
well, sire, I went yonder to take this man who is so troublesome
to your majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In England?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Exactly, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You went to take Monk in
England?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Should I by chance have
done wrong, sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In truth, you are mad,
monsieur!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Not the least in the world,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You have taken Monk?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Where?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In the midst of his
camp."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king trembled with
impatience.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And having taken him on the
causeway of Newcastle, I bring him to your majesty," said
D'Artagnan, simply.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You bring him to me!" cried
the king, almost indignant at what he considered a
mystification.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire," replied
D'Artagnan, in the same tone, "I bring him to you; he is down
below yonder, in a large chest pierced with holes, so as to allow
him to breathe."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good God!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! don't be uneasy, sire,
we have taken the greatest possible care of him.  He comes in
good state, and in perfect condition.  Would your majesty please
to see him, to talk with him, or to have him thrown into the
sea?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, heavens!" repeated
Charles, "oh, heavens! do you speak the truth, monsieur?  Are you
not insulting me with some unworthy joke?  You have accomplished
this unheard-of act of audacity and genius - impossible!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Will your majesty permit me
to open the window?" said D'Artagnan, opening it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king had not time to
reply yes or no.  D'Artagnan gave a shrill and prolonged whistle,
which he repeated three times through the silence of the
night.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "There!" said he, "he will
be brought to your majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>T</span>he king could
not overcome his surprise, and looked sometimes at the smiling
face of the musketeer, and sometimes at the dark window which
opened into the night.  But before he had fixed his ideas, eight
of D'Artagnan's men, for two had remained to take care of the
bark, brought to the house, where Parry received him, that object
of an oblong form, which, for the moment, inclosed the destinies
of England.  Before he left Calais, D'Artagnan had had made in
that city a sort of coffin, large and deep enough for a man to
turn in it at his ease.  The bottom and sides, properly
upholstered, formed a bed sufficiently soft to prevent the
rolling of the ship turning this kind of cage into a rat-trap. 
The little grating, of which D'Artagnan had spoken to the king,
like the visor of the helmet, was placed opposite to the man's
face.  It was so constructed that, at the least cry, a sudden
pressure would stifle that cry, and, if necessary, him who had
uttered that cry.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan was so well
acquainted with his crew and his prisoner, that during the whole
voyage he had been in dread of two things: either that the
general would prefer death to this sort of imprisonment, and
would smother himself by endeavoring to speak, or that his guards
would allow themselves to be tempted by the offers of the
prisoner, and put him, D'Artagnan, into the box instead of
Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan, therefore, had
passed the two days and the two nights of the voyage close to the
coffin, alone with the general, offering him wine and food, which
the latter had refused, and constantly endeavoring to reassure
him upon the destiny which awaited him at the end of this
singular captivity.  Two pistols on the table and his naked sword
made D'Artagnan easy with regard to indiscretions from
without.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                When once at Scheveningen he
had felt completely reassured.  His men greatly dreaded any
conflict with the lords of the soil.  He had, besides, interested
in his cause him who had morally served him as lieutenant, and
whom we have seen reply to the name of Menneville.  The latter,
not being a vulgar spirit, had more to risk than the others,
because he had more conscience.  He believed in a future in the
service of D'Artagnan, and consequently would have allowed
himself to be cut to pieces, rather than violate the order given
by his leader.  Thus it was that, once landed, it was to him that
D'Artagnan had confided the care of the chest and the general's
breathing.  It was he, too, he had ordered to have the chest
brought by the seven men as soon as he should hear the triple
whistle.  We have seen that the lieutenant obeyed.  The coffer
once in the house, D'Artagnan dismissed his men with a gracious
smile, saying, "Messieurs, you have rendered a great service to
King Charles II., who in less than six weeks will be king of
England.  Your gratification will then be doubled.  Return to the
boat and wait for me."  Upon which they departed with such shouts
of joy as terrified even the dog himself.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan had caused the
coffer to be brought as far as the king's ante-chamber.  He then,
with great care, closed the door of this ante-chamber, after
which he opened the coffer, and said to the general:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "General, I have a thousand
excuses to make to you; my manner of acting has not been worthy
of such a man as you, I know very well; but I wished you to take
me for the captain of a bark.  And then England is a very
inconvenient country for transports.  I hope, therefore, you will
take all that into consideration.  But now, general, you are at
liberty to get up and walk."  This said, he cut the bonds which
fastened the arms and hands of the general.  The latter got up,
and then sat down with the countenance of a man who expects
death.  D'Artagnan opened the door of Charles's study, and said,
"Sire, here is your enemy, M. Monk; I promised myself to perform
this service for your majesty.  It is done; now order as you
please.  M. Monk," added he, turning towards the prisoner, "you
are in the presence of his majesty Charles II., sovereign lord of
Great Britain."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk raised towards the
prince his coldly stoical look, and replied: "I know no king of
Great Britain; I recognize even here no one worthy of bearing the
name of gentleman: for it is in the name of King Charles II. that
an emissary, whom I took for an honest man, came and laid an
infamous snare for me.  I have fallen into that snare; so much
the worse for me.  Now, you the tempter," said he to the king;
"you the executor," said he to D'Artagnan; "remember what I am
about to say to you: you have my body, you may kill it, and I
advise you to do so, for you shall never have my mind or my
will.  And now, ask me not a single word, as from this moment I
will not open my mouth even to cry out.  I have said."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                And he pronounced these
words with the savage, invincible resolution of the most
mortified Puritan.  D'Artagnan looked at his prisoner like a man
who knows the value of every word, and who fixes that value
according to the accent with which it has been pronounced.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The fact is," said he, in a
whisper to the king, "the general is an obstinate man; he would
not take a mouthful of bread, nor swallow a drop of wine, during
the two days of our voyage.  But as from this moment it is your
majesty who must decide his fate, I wash my hands of him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk, erect, pale, and
resigned, waited with his eyes fixed and his arms folded. 
D'Artagnan turned towards him.  "You will please to understand
perfectly," said he, "that your speech, otherwise very fine, does
not suit anybody, not even yourself.  His majesty wished to speak
to you, you refused an interview; why, now that you are face to
face, that you are here by a force independent of your will, why
do you confine yourself to the rigors which I consider useless
and absurd?  Speak! what the devil! speak, if only to say
'No.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk did not unclose his
lips; Monk did not turn his eyes; Monk stroked his mustache with
a  thoughtful air, which announced that matters were going on
badly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                During all this time Charles
II. had fallen into a profound reverie.  For the first time he
found himself face to face with Monk; with the man he had so much
desired to see; and, with that peculiar glance which God has
given to eagles and kings, he had fathomed the abyss of his
heart.  He beheld Monk, then, resolved positively to die rather
than speak, which was not to be wondered at in so considerable a
man, the wound in whose mind must at the moment have been cruel. 
Charles II. formed, on the instant, one of those resolutions upon
which an ordinary man risks his life, a general his fortune, and
a king his kingdom.  "Monsieur," said he to Monk, "you are
perfectly right upon certain points; I do not, therefore, ask you
to answer me, but to listen to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                There was a moment's
silence, during which the king looked at Monk, who remained
impassible.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You have made me just now a
painful reproach, monsieur," continued the king; "you said that
one of my emissaries had been to Newcastle to lay a snare for
you, and that, parenthetically, cannot be understood by M.
d'Artagnan here, and to whom, before everything, I owe sincere
thanks for his generous, his heroic devotion."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan bowed with
respect; Monk took no notice.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "For M. d'Artagnan - and
observe, M. Monk, I do not say this to excuse myself - for M.
d'Artagnan," continued the king, "went to England of his free
will, without interest, without orders, without hope, like a true
gentleman as he is, to render a service to an unfortunate king,
and to add to the illustrious actions of an existence, already so
well filled, one glorious deed more."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan colored a little,
and coughed to keep his countenance.  Monk did not stir.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You do not believe what I
tell you, M. Monk," continued the king.  "I can understand that,
- such proofs of devotion are so rare, that their reality may
well be put in doubt."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur would do wrong not
to believe you, sire," cried D'Artagnan: "for that which your
majesty has said is the exact truth, and the truth so exact that
it seems, in going to fetch the general, I have done something
which sets everything wrong.  In truth, if it be so, I am in
despair."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur d'Artagnan," said
the king, pressing the hand of the musketeer, "you have obliged
me as much as if you had promoted the success of my cause, for
you have revealed to me an unknown friend, to whom I shall ever
be grateful, and whom I shall always love."  And the king pressed
his hand cordially.  "And," continued he, bowing to Monk, "an
enemy whom I shall henceforth esteem at his proper value."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The eyes of the Puritan
flashed, but only once, and his countenance, for an instant,
illuminated by that flash, resumed its somber impassibility.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then, Monsieur d'Artagnan,"
continued Charles, "this is what was about to happen: M. le Comte
de la F&egrave;re, who you know, I believe, has set out for
Newcastle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What, Athos!" exclaimed
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, that was his <i>nom de
guerre</i>, I believe.  The Comte de la F&egrave;re had then set
out for Newcastle, and was going, perhaps, to bring the general
to hold a conference with me or with those of my party, when you
violently, as it appears, interfered with the negotiation."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Mordioux!</i>" replied
D'Artagnan, "he entered the camp the very evening in which I
succeeded in getting into it with my fishermen - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                An almost imperceptible
frown on the brow of Monk told D'Artagnan that he had surmised
rightly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, yes," muttered he; "I
thought I knew his person; I even fancied I knew his voice. 
Unlucky wretch that I am!  Oh! sire, pardon me!  I thought I had
so successfully steered my bark."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "There is nothing ill in it,
sir," said the king, "except that the general accuses me of
having laid a snare for him, which is not the case.  No, general,
those are not the arms which I contemplated employing with you,
as you will soon see.  In the meanwhile, when I give you my word
upon the honor of a gentleman, believe me, sir, believe me!  Now,
Monsieur d'Artagnan, a word with you, if you please."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I listen on my knees,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are truly at my
service, are you not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your majesty has seen that
I am, too much so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is well; from a man
like you one word suffices.  In addition to that word you bring
actions.  General, have the goodness to follow me.  Come with us,
M. d'Artagnan"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan, considerably
surprised, prepared to obey.  Charles II. went out, Monk followed
him, D'Artagnan followed Monk.  Charles took the path by which
D'Artagnan had come to his abode; the fresh sea breezes soon
caressed the faces of the three nocturnal travelers, and, at
fifty paces from the little gate which Charles opened, they found
themselves upon the down in the face of the ocean, which, having
ceased to rise, reposed upon the shore like a wearied monster. 
Charles II. walked pensively along, his head hanging down and his
hand beneath his cloak.  Monk followed him, with crossed arms and
an uneasy look.  D'Artagnan came last, with his hand on the hilt
of his sword.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Where is the boat in which
you came, gentlemen?" said Charles to the musketeer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yonder, sire; I have seven
men and an officer waiting me in that little bark which is
lighted by a fire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, I see; the boat is
drawn upon the sand; but you certainly did not come from
Newcastle in that frail bark?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                No, sire; I freighted a
felucca, at my own expense, which is at anchor within cannon-shot
of the downs.  It was in that felucca we made the voyage."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sir," said the king to
Monk, "you are free."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                However firm his will, Monk
could not suppress an exclamation.  The king added an affirmative
motion of his head, and continued: "We shall waken a fisherman of
the village, who will put his boat to sea immediately, and will
take you back to any place you may command him.  M. d'Artagnan
here will escort your honor.  I place M. d'Artagnan under the
safeguard of your loyalty, M. Monk."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk allowed a murmur of
surprise to escape him, and D'Artagnan a profound sigh.  The
king, without appearing to notice either, knocked against the
deal trellis which inclosed the cabin of the principal fisherman
inhabiting the down.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Hey!  Keyser!" cried he,
"awake!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who calls me?" asked the
fisherman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I, Charles the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, my lord!" cried Keyser,
rising ready dressed from the sail in which he slept, as people
sleep in a hammock.  "What can I do to serve you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Captain Keyser," said
Charles, "you must set sail immediately.  Here is a traveler who
wishes to freight your bark, and will pay you well; serve him
well."  And the king drew back a few steps to allow Monk to speak
to the fisherman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I wish to cross over into
England," said Monk, who spoke Dutch enough to make himself
understood.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This minute," said the
<i>patron</i>, "this very minute, if you wish it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But will that be long?"
said Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Not half an hour, your
honor.  My eldest son is at this moment preparing the boat, as we
were going out fishing at three o'clock in the morning."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, is all arranged?"
asked the king, drawing near.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "All but the price," said
the fisherman; "yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is my affair," said
Charles, "the gentleman is my friend."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk started and looked at
Charles on hearing this word.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very well, my lord,"
replied Keyser.  And at that moment they heard Keyser's son,
signaling form the shore with the blast of a bull's horn.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Now, gentlemen," said the
king, "depart."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire," said D'Artagnan,
"will it please your majesty to grant me a few minutes?  I have
engaged men, and I am going without them; I must give them
notice."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Whistle to them," said
Charles, smiling.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan, accordingly,
whistled, whilst the <i>patron</i> Keyser replied to his son; and
four men, led by Menneville, attended the first summons.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Here is some money in
account," said D'Artagnan, putting into their hands a purse
containing two thousand five hundred livres in gold.  "Go and
wait for me at Calais, you know where."  And D'Artagnan heaved a
profound sigh, as he let the purse fall into the hands of
Menneville.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What, are you leaving us?"
cried the men.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "For a short time," said
D'Artagnan, "or for a long time, who knows?  But with 2,500
livres, and the 2,500 you have already received, you are paid
according to our agreement.  We are quits, then, my friend."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But the boat?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do not trouble yourself
about that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Our things are on board the
felucca."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Go and seek them, and then
set off immediately."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, captain."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan returned to Monk,
saying, - "Monsieur, I await your orders, for I understand we are
to go together, unless my company be disagreeable to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "On the contrary, monsieur,"
said Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Come, gentlemen, on board,"
cried Keyser's son.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Charles bowed to the general
with grace and dignity, saying, - "You will pardon me this
unfortunate accident, and the violence to which you have been
subjected, when you are convinced that I was not the cause of
them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk bowed profoundly
without replying.  On his side, Charles affected not to say a
word to D'Artagnan in private, but aloud, - "Once more, thanks,
monsieur le chevalier," said he, "thanks for your services.  They
will be repaid you by the Lord God, who, I hope, reserves trials
and troubles for me alone."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk followed Keyser and his
son embarked with them.  D'Artagnan came after, muttering to
himself, - "Poor Planchet! poor Planchet!  I am very much afraid
we have made a bad speculation."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>D</span>uring the
passage, Monk only spoke to D'Artagnan in cases of urgent
necessity.  Thus, when the Frenchman hesitated to come and take
his meals, poor meals, composed of salt fish, biscuit, and
Hollands gin, Monk called him, saying, - "To table, monsieur, to
table!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This was all.  D'Artagnan,
from being himself on all great occasions, extremely concise, did
not draw from the general's conciseness a favorable augury of the
result of his mission.  Now, as D'Artagnan had plenty of time for
reflection, he battered his brains during this time in
endeavoring to find out how Athos had seen King Charles, how he
had conspired his departure with him, and lastly, how he had
entered Monk's camp; and the poor lieutenant of musketeers
plucked a hair from his mustache every time that he reflected
that the horseman who accompanied Monk on the night of the famous
abduction must have been Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                At length, after a passage
of two nights and two days, the <i>patron</i> Keyser touched at
the point where Monk, who had given all the orders during the
voyage, had commanded they should land.  It was exactly at the
mouth of the little river, near where Athos had chosen his
abode.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Daylight was waning, a
splendid sun, like a red steel buckler, was plunging the lower
extremity of its disc beneath the blue line of the sea.  The
felucca was making fair way up the river, tolerably wide in that
part, but Monk, in his impatience, desired to be landed, and
Keyser's boat set him and D'Artagnan upon the muddy bank, amidst
the reeds.  D'Artagnan, resigned to obedience, followed Monk
exactly as a chained bear follows his master; but the position
humiliated him not a little, and he grumbled to himself that the
service of kings was a bitter one, and that the best of them was
good for nothing.  Monk walked with long and hasty strides; it
might be thought that he did not yet feel certain of having
reached English land.  They had already begun to perceive
distinctly a few of the cottages of the sailors and fishermen
spread over the little quay of this humble port, when, all at
once, D'Artagnan cried out, - "God pardon me, there is a house on
fire!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk raised his eyes, and
perceived there was, in fact, a house which the flames were
beginning to devour.  It had begun at a little shed belonging to
the house, the roof of which had caught.  The fresh evening
breeze agitated the fire.  The two travelers quickened their
steps, hearing loud cries, and seeing, as they drew nearer,
soldiers with their glittering arms pointed towards the house on
fire.  It was doubtless this menacing occupation which had made
them neglect to signal the felucca.  Monk stopped short for an
instant, and, for the first time, formulated his thoughts into
words.  "Eh! but," said he, "perhaps they are not my soldiers but
Lambert's."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                These words contained at
once a sorrow, and apprehension, and a reproach perfectly
intelligible to D'Artagnan.  In fact, during the general's
absence, Lambert might have given battle, conquered, and
dispersed the parliament's army, and taken with his own the place
of Monk's army, deprived of its strongest support.  At this
doubt, which passed from the mind of Monk to his own, D'Artagnan
reasoned in this manner: - "One of two things is going to happen;
either Monk has spoken correctly, and there are no longer any but
Lambertists in the country - that is to say, enemies, who would
receive me wonderfully well, since it is to me they owe their
victory; or nothing is changed, and Monk, transported with joy at
finding his camp still in the same place, will not prove too
severe in his settlement with me."  Whilst thinking thus, the two
travelers advanced, and began to mingle with a little knot of
sailors, who looked on with sorrow at the burning house, but did
not dare to say anything on account of the threats of the
soldiers.  Monk addressed one of these sailors: - "What is going
on here?" asked he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sir," replied  the man, not
recognizing Monk as an officer, under the thick cloak which
enveloped him, "that house was inhabited by a foreign gentleman,
and this foreigner became suspected by the soldiers.  They wanted
to get into his house under pretense of taking him to the camp;
but he, without being frightened by their number, threatened
death to the first who should cross the threshold of his door;
and as there was one who did venture, the Frenchman stretched him
on the earth with a pistol-shot."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! he is a Frenchman, is
he?" said D'Artagnan, rubbing his hands.  "Good!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How good?" replied the
fisherman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, I don't mean that. -
What then - my tongue slipped."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What then, sir? - why, the
other men became as enraged as so many lions: they fired more
than a hundred shots at the house; but the Frenchman was
sheltered by the wall, and every time they tried to enter by the
door they met with a shot from his lackey, whose aim is deadly,
d'ye see?  Every time they threatened the window, they met with a
pistol-shot from the master.  Look and count - there are seven
men down."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! my brave countryman,"
cried D'Artagnan, "wait a little, wait a little.  I will be with
you; and we will settle with this rabble."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "One instant, sir," said
Monk, "wait."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Long?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No; only the time to ask a
question."  Then, turning towards the sailor, "My friend," asked
he, with an emotion which, in spite of all his self-command, he
could not conceal, "whose soldiers are these, pray tell me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Whose should they be but
that madman, Monk's?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "There has been no battle,
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A battle, ah, yes! for what
purpose?  Lambert's army is melting away like snow in April.  All
come to Monk, officers and soldiers.  In a week Lambert won't
have fifty men left."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The fisherman was
interrupted by a fresh discharge directed against the house, and
by another pistol-shot which replied to the discharge and struck
down the most daring of the aggressors.  The rage of soldiers was
at its height.  The fire still continued to increase, and a crest
of flame and smoke whirled and spread over the roof of the
house.  D'Artagnan could no longer contain himself. 
"<i>Mordioux!</i>" said he to Monk, glancing at him sideways:
"you are a general, and allow your men to burn houses and
assassinate people, while you look on and warm your hands at the
blaze of the conflagration?  <i>Mordioux!</i> you are not a
man."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Patience, sir, patience!"
said Monk, smiling.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Patience! yes, until that
brave gentleman is roasted - is that what you mean?"  And
D'Artagnan rushed forward.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Remain where you are, sir,"
said Monk, in a tone of command.  And he advanced towards the
house, just as an officer had approached it, saying to the
besieged: "The house is burning, you will be roasted within an
hour!  There is still time - come, tell us what you know of
General Monk, and we will spare your life.  Reply, or by Saint
Patrick - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The besieged made no answer;
he was no doubt reloading his pistol.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A reinforcement is
expected," continued the officer; "in a quarter of an hour there
will be a hundred men around your house."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I reply to you," said the
Frenchman.  "Let your men be sent away; I will come out freely
and repair to the camp alone, or else I will be killed here!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Mille tonnerres!</i>"
shouted D'Artagnan; "why, that's the voice of Athos!  <i>Ah
canailles!</i>" and the sword of D'Artagnan flashed from its
sheath.  Monk stopped him and advanced himself, exclaiming, in a
sonorous voice: "<i>Hol&agrave;!</i> what is going on here? 
Digby, whence this fire? why these cries?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The general!" cried Digby,
letting the point of his sword fall.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The general!" repeated the
soldiers.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, what is there so
astonishing in that?" said Monk, in a calm tone.  Then, silence
being re-established, - "Now," said he, "who lit this fire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The soldiers hung their
heads.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What! do I ask a question,
and nobody answers me?" said Monk.  "What! do I find a fault, and
nobody repairs it?  The fire is still burning, I believe."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Immediately the twenty men
rushed forward, seizing pails, buckets, jars, barrels, and
extinguishing the fire with as much ardor as they had, an instant
before, employed in promoting it.  But already, and before all
the rest, D'Artagnan had applied a ladder to the house, crying,
"Athos! it is I, D'Artagnan!  Do not kill me, my dearest
friend!"  And in a moment the count was clasped in his arms.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                In the meantime, Grimaud,
preserving his calmness, dismantled the fortification of the
ground-floor, and after having opened the door, stood, with his
arms folded, quietly on the sill.  Only, on hearing the voice of
D'Artagnan, he uttered an exclamation of surprise.  The fire
being extinguished, the soldiers presented themselves, Digby at
their head.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "General," said he, "excuse
us; what we have done was for love of your honor, whom we thought
lost."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are mad, gentlemen. 
Lost!  Is a man like me to be lost?  Am I not permitted to be
absent, according to my pleasure, without giving formal notice? 
Do you, by chance, take me for a citizen from the city?  Is a
gentleman, my friend, my guest, to be besieged, entrapped, and
threatened with death, because he is suspected?  What signifies
the word, suspected?  Curse me if I don't have every one of you
shot like dogs, that the brave gentleman has left alive!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "General," said Digby,
piteously, "there were twenty-eight of us, and see, there are
eight on the ground."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I authorize M. le Comte de
la F&egrave;re to send the twenty to join the eight," said Monk,
stretching out his hand to Athos.  "Let them return to camp.  Mr.
Digby, you will consider yourself under arrest for a month."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "General - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is to teach you, sir,
not to act, another time, without orders."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I had those of the
lieutenant, general."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The lieutenant had no such
orders to give you, and he shall be placed under arrest, instead
of you, if he has really commanded you to burn this
gentleman."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He did not command that,
general; he commanded us to bring him to the camp; but the count
was not willing to follow us."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I was not willing that they
should enter and plunder my house," said Athos to Monk, with a
significant look.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you were quite right. 
To the camp, I say."  The soldiers departed with dejected looks. 
"Now we are alone," said Monk to Athos, "have the goodness to
tell me, monsieur, why you persisted in remaining here, whilst
you had your felucca - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I waited for you, general,"
said Athos.  "Had not your honor appointed to meet me in a
week?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                An eloquent look from
D'Artagnan made it clear to Monk that these two men, so brave and
so loyal, had not acted in concert for his abduction.  He knew
already it could not be so.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," said he to
D'Artagnan, "you were perfectly right.  Have the kindness to
allow me a moment's conversation with M. le Comte de la
F&egrave;re?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan took advantage of
this to go and ask Grimaud how he was.  Monk requested Athos to
conduct him to the chamber he lived in.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This chamber was still full
of smoke and rubbish.  More than fifty balls had passed through
the windows and mutilated the walls.  They found a table,
inkstand, and materials for writing.  Monk took up a pen, wrote a
single line, signed it, folded the paper, sealed the letter with
the seal of his ring, and handed over the missive to Athos,
saying, "Monsieur, carry, if you please, this letter to King
Charles II., and set out immediately, if nothing detains you here
any longer."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And the casks?" said
Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The fisherman who brought
me hither will assist you in transporting them on board.  Depart,
if possible, within an hour."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, general," said
Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur D'Artagnan!" cried
Monk, from the window.  D'Artagnan ran up precipitately.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Embrace your friend and bid
him adieu, sir; he is returning to Holland."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To Holland!" cried
D'Artagnan; "and I?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are at liberty to
follow him, monsieur; but I request you to remain," said Monk. 
"Will you refuse me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, no, general; I am at
your orders."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan embraced Athos,
and only had time to bid him adieu.  Monk watched them both. 
Then he took upon himself the preparations for the departure, the
transportation of the casks on board, and the embarking of Athos;
then, taking D'Artagnan by the arm, who was quite amazed and
agitated, he led him towards Newcastle.  Whilst going along, the
general leaning on his arm, D'Artagnan could not help murmuring
to himself, - "Come, come, it seems to me that the shares of the
firm of Planchet and Company are rising."</p>

Monk reveals Himself.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>D</span>'Artagnan,
although he flattered himself with better success, had,
nevertheless, not too well comprehended his situation.  It was a
strange and grave subject for him to reflect upon - this voyage
of Athos into England; this league of the king with Athos, and
that extraordinary combination of his design with that of the
Comte de la F&egrave;re.  The best way was to let things follow
their own train.  An imprudence had been committed, and, whilst
having succeeded, as he had promised, D'Artagnan found that he
had gained no advantage by his success.  Since everything was
lost, he could risk no more.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan followed Monk
through his camp.  The return of the general had produced a
marvelous effect, for his people had thought him lost.  But Monk,
with his austere look and icy demeanor, appeared to ask of his
eager lieutenants and delighted soldiers the cause of all this
joy.  Therefore, to the lieutenants who had come to meet him, and
who expressed the uneasiness with which they had learnt his
departure, -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why is all this?" said he;
"am I obliged to give you an account of myself?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But your honor, the sheep
may well tremble without the shepherd."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Tremble!" replied Monk, in
his calm and powerful voice; "ah, monsieur, what a word!  Curse
me, if my sheep have not both teeth and claws; I renounce being
their shepherd.  Ah, you tremble, gentlemen, do you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, general, for you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! pray meddle with your
own concerns.  If I have not the wit God gave to Oliver Cromwell,
I have that which He has sent to me: I am satisfied with it,
however little it may be."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The officer made no reply;
and Monk, having imposed silence on his people, all remained
persuaded that he had accomplished some important work or made
some important trial.  This was forming a very poor conception of
his patience and scrupulous genius.  Monk, if he had the good
faith of the Puritans, his allies, must have returned fervent
thanks to the patron saint who had taken him from the box of M.
d'Artagnan.  Whilst these things were going on, our musketeer
could not help constantly repeating, -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "God grant that M. Monk may
not have as much pride as I have; for I declare that if any one
had put me into a coffer with that grating over my mouth, and
carried me packed up, like a calf, across the seas, I should
cherish such a memory of my piteous looks in that coffer, and
such an ugly animosity against him who had inclosed me in it, I
should dread so greatly to see a sarcastic smile blooming upon
the face of the malicious wretch, or in his attitude any
grotesque imitation of my position in the box, that,
<i>Mordioux!</i>  I should plunge a good dagger into his throat
in compensation for the grating, and would nail him down in a
veritable bier, in remembrance of the false coffin in which I had
been left in to grow moldy for two days."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                And D'Artagnan spoke
honestly when he spoke thus; for the skin of our Gascon was a
very thin one.  Monk, fortunately, entertained other ideas.  He
never opened his mouth to his timid conqueror concerning the
past; but he admitted him very near to his person in his labors,
took him with him to several reconnoiterings, in such a way as to
obtain that which he evidently warmly desired, - a rehabilitation
in the mind of D'Artagnan.  The latter conducted himself like a
past-master in the art of flattery: he admired all Monk's
tactics, and the ordering of his camp; he joked very pleasantly
upon the circumvallations of Lambert's camp, who had, he said,
very uselessly given himself the trouble to inclose a camp for
twenty thousand men, whilst an acre of ground would have been
quite sufficient for the corporal and fifty guards who would
perhaps remain faithful to him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk, immediately after his
arrival, had accepted the proposition made by Lambert the evening
before, for an interview, and which Monk's lieutenants had
refused under the pretext that the general was indisposed.  This
interview was neither long nor interesting: Lambert demanded a
profession of faith from his rival.  The latter declared he had
no other opinion than that of the majority.  Lambert asked if it
would not be more expedient to terminate the quarrel by an
alliance than by a battle.  Monk hereupon demanded a week for
consideration.  Now, Lambert could not refuse this: and Lambert,
nevertheless, had come saying that he should devour Monk's army. 
Therefore, at the end of the interview, which Lambert's party
watched with impatience, nothing was decided - neither treaty nor
battle - the rebel army, as M. d'Artagnan had foreseen, began to
prefer the good cause to the bad one, and the parliament,
<i>rumpish</i> as it was, to the pompous nothings of Lambert's
designs.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                They remembered, likewise,
the good feasts of London - the profusion of ale and sherry with
which the citizens of London paid their friends the soldiers; -
they looked with terror at the black war bread, at the troubled
waters of the Tweed, - too salt for the glass, not enough so for
the pot; and they said to themselves, "Are not the roast meats
kept warm for Monk in London?"  From that time nothing was heard
of but desertion in Lambert's army.  The soldiers allowed
themselves to be drawn away by the force of principles, which
are, like discipline, the obligatory tie in everybody constituted
for any purpose.  Monk defended the parliament - Lambert attacked
it.  Monk had no more inclination to support parliament than
Lambert, but he had it inscribed on his standards, so that all
those of the contrary party were reduced to write upon theirs,
"Rebellion," which sounded ill to puritan ears.  They flocked,
then, from Lambert to Monk, as sinners flock from Baal to
God.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk made his calculations;
at a thousand desertions a day Lambert had men enough to last
twenty days; but there is in sinking things such a growth of
weight and swiftness, which combine with each other, that a
hundred left the first day, five hundred the second, a thousand
the third.  Monk thought he had obtained his rate.  But from one
thousand the deserters increased to two thousand, then to four
thousand, and, a week after, Lambert, perceiving that he had no
longer the possibility of accepting battle, if it were offered to
him, took the wise resolution of decamping during the night,
returning to London, and being beforehand with Monk in
constructing a power with the wreck of the military party.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                But Monk, free and without
uneasiness, marched towards London as a conqueror, augmenting his
army with all the floating parties on the way.  He encamped at
Barnet, that is to say, within four leagues of the capital,
cherished by the parliament, which thought it beheld in him a
protector, and awaited by the people, who were anxious to see him
reveal himself, that they might judge him.  D'Artagnan himself
had not been able to fathom his tactics; he observed - he
admired.  Monk could not enter London with a settled
determination without bringing about civil war.  He temporized
for a short time.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Suddenly, when least
expected, Monk drove the military party out of London, and
installed himself in the city amidst the citizens, by order of
the parliament; then, at the moment when the citizens were crying
out against Monk - at the moment when the soldiers themselves
were accusing their leader - Monk, finding himself certain of a
majority, declared to the Rump Parliament that it must abdicate -
be dissolved - and yield its place to a government which would
not be a joke.  Monk pronounced this declaration, supported by
fifty thousand swords, to which, that same evening, were united,
with shouts of delirious joy, the five thousand inhabitants of
the good city of London.  At length, at the moment when the
people, after their triumphs and festive repasts in the open
streets, were looking about for a master, it was affirmed that a
vessel had left the Hague, bearing King Charles II. and his
fortunes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Gentlemen," said Monk to
his officers, "I am going to meet the legitimate king.  He who
loves me will follow me."  A burst of acclamations welcomed these
words, which D'Artagnan did not hear without the greatest
delight.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Mordioux!</i>" said he
to Monk, "that is bold, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You will accompany me, will
you not?" said Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Pardieu!</i> general. 
But tell me, I beg, what you wrote by Athos, that is to say, the
Comte de la F&egrave;re - you know - the day of our arrival?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have no secrets from you
now," replied Monk.  "I wrote these words: 'Sire, I expect your
majesty in six weeks at Dover.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah!" said D'Artagnan, "I no
longer say it is bold; I say it is well played; it is a fine
stroke!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are something of a
judge in such matters," replied Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                And this was the only time
the general had ever made an allusion to his voyage to
Holland.</p>

'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>T</span>he king of
England made his <i>entr&eacute;e</i> into Dover with great pomp,
as he afterwards did in London.  He had sent for his brothers; he
had brought over his mother and sister.  England had been for so
long a time given up to herself - that is to say, to tyranny,
mediocrity and nonsense - that this return of Charles II., whom
the English only knew as the son of the man whose head they had
cut off, was a festival for three kingdoms.  Consequently, all
the good wishes, all the acclamations which accompanied his
return, struck the young king so forcibly that he stooped and
whispered in the ear of James of York, his younger brother, "In
truth, James, it seems to have been our own fault that we were so
long absent from a country where we are so much beloved!"  The
pageant was magnificent.  Beautiful weather favored the
solemnity.  Charles had regained all his youth, all his good
humor; he appeared to be transfigured; hearts seemed to smile on
him like the sun.  Amongst this noisy crowd of courtiers and
worshipers, who did not appear to remember they had conducted to
the scaffold at Whitehall the father of the new king, a man, in
the garb of a lieutenant of musketeers, looked, with a smile upon
his thin, intellectual lips, sometimes at the people vociferating
their blessings, and sometimes at the prince, who pretended
emotion, and who bowed most particularly to the women, whose
<i>bouquets</i> fell beneath his horse's feet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What a fine trade is that
of king!" said this man, so completely absorbed in contemplation
that he stopped in the middle of the road, leaving the
<i>cort&eacute;ge</i> to file past.  "Now, there is, in good
truth, a prince all bespangled over with gold and diamonds,
enamelled with flowers like a spring meadow; he is about to
plunge his empty hands into the immense coffer in which his now
faithful - but so lately unfaithful - subjects have amassed one
or two cartloads of ingots of gold.  They cast <i>bouquets</i>
enough upon him to smother him; and yet, if he had presented
himself to them two months ago, they would have sent as many
bullets and balls at him as they now throw flowers.  Decidedly it
is worth something to be born in a certain sphere, with due
respect to the lowly, who pretend that it is of very little
advantage to them to be born lowly."  The <i>cort&eacute;ge</i>
continued to file on, and, with the king, the acclamations began
to die away in the direction of the palace, which, however, did
not prevent our officer from being pushed about.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Mordioux!</i>" continued
the reasoner, "these people tread upon my toes and look upon
<i>me</i> as of very little consequence, or rather of none at
all, seeing that they are Englishmen and I am a Frenchman.  If
all these people were asked, - 'Who is M. d'Artagnan?' they would
reply, '<i>Nescio vos</i>.'  But let any one say to them, 'There
is the king going by,' 'There is M. Monk going by,' they would
run away, shouting, - '<i>Vive le roi!</i>'  '<i>Vive M.
Monk!</i>' till their lungs were exhausted.  And yet," continued
he, surveying, with that look sometimes so keen and sometimes so
proud, the diminishing crowd, - "and yet, reflect a little, my
good people, on what your king has done, on what M. Monk has
done, and then think what has been done by this poor unknown, who
is called M. d'Artagnan!  It is true you do not know him, since
he is here unknown, and that prevents your thinking about the
matter!  But, bah! what matters it!  All that does not prevent
Charles II. from being a great king, although he has been exiled
twelve years, or M. Monk from being a great captain, although he
did make a voyage to Holland in a box.  Well, then, since it is
admitted that one is a great king and the other a great captain,
- '<i>Hurrah for King Charles II.! - Hurrah for General
Monk!</i>'"  And his voice mingled with the voices of the
hundreds of spectators, over which it sounded for a moment. 
Then, the better to play the devoted man, he took off his hat and
waved it in the air.  Some one seized his arm in the very height
of his expansive loyalism.  (In 1660 that was so termed which we
now call royalism.)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Athos!" cried D'Artagnan,
"you here!"  And the two friends seized each other's hands.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You here! - and being
here," continued the musketeer, "you are not in the midst of all
these courtiers, my dear comte!  What! you, the hero of the
<i>f&ecirc;te</i>, you are not prancing on the left hand of the
king, as M. Monk is prancing on the right?  In truth, I cannot
comprehend your character, nor that of the prince who owes you so
much!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Always scornful, my dear
D'Artagnan!" said Athos.  "Will you never correct yourself of
that vile habit?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But you do not form part of
the pageant?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I do not, because I was not
willing to do so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And why were you not
willing?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Because I am neither envoy
nor ambassador, nor representative of the king of France; and it
does not become me to exhibit myself thus near the person of
another king than the one God has given me for a master."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Mordioux!</i> you came
very near to the person of the king, his father."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That was another thing, my
friend; he was about to die."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And yet that which you did
for him - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I did it because it was my
duty to do it.  But you know I hate all ostentation.  Let King
Charles II., then, who no longer stands in need of me, leave me
to my rest, and the shadow; that is all I claim of him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan sighed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What is the matter with
you?" said Athos.  "One would say that this happy return of the
king to London saddens you, my friend; you who have done at least
as much for his majesty as I have."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Have I not," replied
D'Artagnan, with his Gascon laugh, "have I not done much for his
majesty, without any one suspecting it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, yes, but the king is
well aware of it, my friend," cried Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He is aware of it!" said
the musketeer bitterly.  "By my faith!  I did not suspect so, and
I was even a moment ago trying to forget it myself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But he, my friend, will not
forget it, I will answer for him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You tell me that to console
me a little, Athos."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "For what?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Mordioux!</i> for all
the expense I incurred.  I have ruined myself, my friend, ruined
myself for the restoration of this young prince who has just
passed, cantering on his <i>isabelle</i> colored horse."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The king does not know you
have ruined yourself, my friend; but he knows he owes you
much."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And say, Athos, does that
advance me in any respect? for, to do you justice, you have
labored nobly.  But I - I who in appearance marred your
combinations, it was I who really made them succeed.  Follow my
calculations closely; you might not have, by persuasions or
mildness, convinced General Monk, whilst I so roughly treated
this dear general, that I furnished your prince with an
opportunity of showing himself generous: this generosity was
inspired in him by the fact of my fortunate mistake, and Charles
is paid by the restoration which Monk has brought about."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "All that, my dear friend,
is strikingly true," replied Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, strikingly true as it
may be, it is not less true, my friend, that I shall return -
greatly beloved by M. Monk, who calls me <i>dear captain</i> all
day long, although I am neither dear to him nor a captain; - and
much appreciated by the king, who has already forgotten my name;
- it is not less true, I say, that I shall return to my beautiful
country, cursed by the soldiers I had raised with the hopes of
large pay, cursed by the brave Planchet, of who I have borrowed a
part of his fortune."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How is that?  What the
devil had Planchet to do in all this?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, yes, my friend; but
this king, so spruce, so smiling, so adored, M. Monk fancies he
has recalled him, you fancy you have supported him, I fancy I
have brought him back, the people fancy they have reconquered
him, he himself fancies he has negotiated his restoration; and
yet nothing of all this is true, for Charles II., king of
England, Scotland, and Ireland, has been replaced upon the throne
by a French grocer, who lives in the Rue des Lombards, and is
named Planchet.  And such is grandeur!  'Vanity!' says the
Scripture: vanity, all is vanity.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos could not help
laughing at this whimsical outbreak of his friend.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My dear D'Artagnan," said
he, pressing his hand affectionately, "should you not exercise a
little more philosophy?  Is it not some further satisfaction to
you to have saved my life as you did by arriving so fortunately
with Monk, when those damned parliamentarians wanted to burn me
alive?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, but you, in some
degree, deserved a little burning, my friend."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How so?  What, for having
saved King Charles's million?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What million?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, that is true! you never
knew that, my friend; but you must not be angry, for it was my
secret.  That word 'REMEMBER' which the king pronounced upon the
scaffold."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And which means
'<i>souviens-toi!</i>'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Exactly.  That was
signified.  'Remember there is a million buried in the vaults of
Newcastle Abbey, and that that million belongs to my son.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! very well, I
understand.  But what I understand likewise, and what is very
frightful, is, that every time his majesty Charles II. will think
of me, he will say to himself: 'There is the man who came very
near to making me lose my crown.  Fortunately I was generous,
great, full of presence of mind.'  That will be said by the young
gentleman in a shabby black doublet, who came to the
ch&acirc;teau of Blois, hat in hand, to ask me if I would give
him access to the king of France."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "D'Artagnan!  D'Artagnan!"
said Athos, laying his hand on the shoulder of the musketeer,
"you are unjust."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have a right to be
so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No - for you are ignorant
of the future."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan looked his friend
full in the face, and began to laugh.  "In truth, my dear Athos,"
said he, "you have some sayings so superb, that they only belong
to you and M. le Cardinal Mazarin."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos frowned slightly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I beg your pardon,"
continued D'Artagnan, laughing, "I beg your pardon if I have
offended you.  The future!  <i>Nein!</i> what pretty words are
words that promise, and how well they fill the mouth in default
of other things!  <i>Mordioux!</i>  After having met with so many
who promised, when shall I find one who will give?  But, let that
pass!" continued D'Artagnan.  "What are you doing here, my dear
Athos?  Are you the king's treasurer?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How - why the king's
treasurer?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, since the king
possess a million, he must want a treasurer.  The king of France,
although he is not worth a sou, has still a superintendent of
finance, M. Fouquet.  It is true, that, in exchange, M. Fouquet,
they say, has a good number of millions of his own."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! our million was spent
long ago," said Athos, laughing in his turn.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I understand; it was
frittered away in satin, precious stones, velvet, and feathers of
all sorts and colors.  All these princes and princesses stood in
great need of tailors and dressmakers.  Eh!  Athos, do you
remember what we fellows spent in equipping ourselves for the
campaign of La Rochelle, and to make our appearance on
horseback?  Two or three thousand livres, by my faith!  But a
king's robe is the more ample; it would require a million to
purchase the stuff.  At least, Athos, if you are not treasurer,
you are on good footing at court."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "By the faith of a
gentleman, I know nothing about it," said Athos, simply.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What! you know nothing
about it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No!  I have not seen the
king since we left Dover."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then he has forgotten you,
too!  <i>Mordioux!</i>  That is shameful!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "His majesty has had so much
business to transact."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!" cried D'Artagnan, with
one of those intelligent grimaces which he alone knew how to
make, "that is enough to make me recover my love for Monseigneur
Giulio Mazarini.  What, Athos! the king has not seen you since
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you are not
furious?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I! why should I be?  Do you
imagine, my dear D'Artagnan, that it was on the king's account I
acted as I have done?  I did not know the young man.  I defended
the father, who represented a principle - sacred in my eyes, and
I allowed myself to be drawn towards the son from sympathy for
this same principle.  Besides, he was a worthy knight, a noble
creature, that father; do you remember him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes; that is true; he was a
brave, an excellent man, who led a sad life, but made a fine
end."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, my dear D'Artagnan,
understand this; to that king, to that man of heart, to that
friend of my thoughts, if I durst venture to say so, I swore at
the last hour to preserve faithfully the secret of a deposit
which was to be transmitted to his son, to assist him in his hour
of need.  This young man came to me; he described his
destitution; he was ignorant that he was anything to me save a
living memory of his father.  I have accomplished towards Charles
II. what I promised Charles I.; that is all!  Of what consequence
is it to me, then, whether he be grateful or not?  It is to
myself I have rendered a service, by relieving myself of this
responsibility, and not to him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, I have always said,"
replied D'Artagnan, with a sigh, "that disinterestedness was the
finest thing in the world."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, and you, my friend,"
resumed Athos, "are you not in the same situation as myself?  If
I have properly understood your words, you allowed yourself to be
affected by the misfortunes of this young man; that, on your
part, was much greater than it was upon mine, for I had a duty to
fulfill; whilst you were under no obligation to the son of the
martyr.  You had not, on your part, to pay him the price of that
precious drop of blood which he let fall upon my brow, through
the floor of the scaffold.  That which made you act was heart
alone - the noble and good heart which you possess beneath your
apparent skepticism and sarcastic irony; you have engaged the
fortune of a servitor, and your own, I suspect, my benevolent
miser! and your sacrifice is not acknowledged!  Of what
consequence is it?  You wish to repay Planchet his money.  I can
comprehend that, my friend: for it is not becoming in a gentleman
to borrow from his inferior, without returning to him principal
and interest.  Well, I will sell La F&egrave;re if necessary, and
if not, some little farm.  You shall pay Planchet, and there will
be enough, believe me, of corn left in my granaries for us two
and Raoul.  In this way, my friend, you will be under obligations
to nobody but yourself; and, if I know you well, it will not be a
small satisfaction to your mind to be able to say, 'I have made a
king!'  Am I right?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Athos!  Athos!" murmured
D'Artagnan, thoughtfully, "I have told you more than once that
the day on which you will preach I shall attend the sermon; the
day on which you will tell me there is a hell - <i>Mordioux!</i> 
I shall be afraid of the gridiron and the pitch-forks.  You are
better than I, or rather, better than anybody, and I only
acknowledge the possession of one quality, and that is, of not
being jealous.  Except that defect, damme, as the English say, if
I have not all the rest."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I know no one equal to
D'Artagnan," replied Athos; "but here we are, having quietly
reached the house I inhabit.  Will you come in, my friend?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eh! why this is the tavern
of the Corne du Cerf, I think," said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I confess I chose it on
purpose.  I like old acquaintances; I like to sit down on that
place, whereon I sank, overcome by fatigue, overwhelmed by
despair, when you returned on the 31st of January."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "After having discovered the
abode of the masked executioner?  Yes, that was a terrible
day!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Come in, then," said Athos,
interrupting him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                They entered the large
apartment, formerly the common one.  The tavern, in general, and
this room in particular, had undergone great changes; the ancient
host of the musketeers, having become tolerably rich for an
innkeeper, had closed his shop, and make of this room of which we
were speaking, a store-room for colonial provisions.  As for the
rest of the house, he let it ready furnished to strangers.  It
was with unspeakable emotion D'Artagnan recognized all the
furniture of the chamber of the first story; the wainscoting, the
tapestries, and even that geographical chart which Porthos had so
fondly studied in his moments of leisure.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is eleven years ago,"
cried D'Artagnan.  "<i>Mordioux!</i> it appears to me a
century!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And to me but a day," said
Athos.  "Imagine the joy I experience, my friend, in seeing you
there, in pressing your hand, in casting from me sword and
dagger, and tasting without mistrust this glass of sherry.  And,
oh! what still further joy it would be, if our two friends were
there, at the two corners of the table, and Raoul, my beloved
Raoul, on the threshold, looking at us with his large eyes, at
once so brilliant and so soft!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, yes," said D'Artagnan,
much affected, "that is true.  I approve particularly of the
first part of your thought; it is very pleasant to smile there
where we have so legitimately shuddered in thinking that from one
moment to another M. Mordaunt might appear upon the landing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                At this moment the door
opened, and D'Artagnan, brave as he was, could not restrain a
slight movement of fright.  Athos understood him, and, smiling,
-</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is our host," said he,
"bringing me a letter."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, my lord," said the
good man; "here is a letter for your honor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thank you," said Athos,
taking the letter without looking at it.  "Tell me, my dear host,
if you do not remember this gentleman?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The old man raised his head,
and looked attentively at D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No," said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is," said Athos, "one of
those friends of whom I have spoken to you, and who lodged here
with me eleven years ago."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! but," said the old man,
"so many strangers have lodged here!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But we lodged here on the
30th of January, 1649," added Athos, believing he should
stimulate the lazy memory of the host by this remark.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is very possible,"
replied he, smiling; "but it is so long ago!" and he bowed, and
went out.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thank you," said D'Artagnan
- "perform exploits, accomplish revolutions, endeavor to engrave
your name in stone or bronze with strong swords! there is
something more rebellious, more hard, more forgetful than iron,
bronze, or stone, and that is, the brain of a lodging-house
keeper who has grown rich in the trade; - he does not know me! 
Well, I should have known him, though."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos, smiling at his
friend's philosophy, unsealed his letter.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah!" said he, "a letter
from Parry."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! oh!" said D'Artagnan;
"read it, my friend, read it!  No doubt it contains news."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos shook his head, and
read:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "MONSIEUR LE COMTE. - The
king has experienced much regret at not seeing you to-day beside
him, at his entrance.  His majesty commands me to say so, and to
recall him to your memory.  His majesty will expect you this
evening, at the palace of St. James, between nine and ten
o'clock.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am, respectfully,
monsieur le comte, your honor's very humble and very obedient
servant, - PARRY."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You see, my dear
D'Artagnan," said Athos, "we must not despair of the hearts of
kings."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Not despair! you are right
to say so!" replied D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! my dear, very dear
friend," resumed Athos, whom the almost imperceptible bitterness
of D'Artagnan had not escaped.  "Pardon me! can I have
unintentionally wounded my best comrade?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are mad, Athos, and to
prove it, I shall conduct you to the palace; to the very gate, I
mean; the walk will do me good."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You shall go in with me, my
friend; I will speak to his majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, no!" replied
D'Artagnan, with true pride, free from all mixture; "if there is
anything worse than begging yourself, it is making others beg for
you.  Come, let us go, my friend, the walk will be charming; on
the way I shall show you the house of M. Monk, who has detained
me with him.  A beautiful house, by my faith.  Being a general in
England is better than being a mar&eacute;chal in France, please
to know."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos allowed himself to be
led along, quite saddened by D'Artagnan's forced attempts at
gayety.  The whole city was in a state of joy; the two friends
were jostled at every moment by enthusiasts who required them, in
their intoxication, to cry out, "Long live good King Charles!" 
D'Artagnan replied by a grunt, and Athos by a smile.  They
arrived thus in front of Monk's house, before which, as we have
said, they had to pass on their way to St. James's.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos and D'Artagnan said
but little on the road, for the simple reason that they would
have had so many things to talk about if they had spoken.  Athos
thought that by speaking he should evince satisfaction, and that
might wound D'Artagnan.  The latter feared that in speaking he
should allow some little bitterness to steal into his words which
would render his company unpleasant to his friend.  It was a
singular emulation of silence between contentment and ill-humor. 
D'Artagnan gave way first to that itching at the tip of his
tongue which he so habitually experienced.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do you remember, Athos,"
said he, "the passage of the 'M&eacute;moires de D'Aubigny,' in
which that devoted servant, a Gascon like myself, poor as myself,
and, I was going to add, brave as myself, relates instances of
the meanness of Henry IV.?  My father always told me, I remember,
that D'Aubigny was a liar.  But, nevertheless, examine how all
the princes, the issue of the great Henry, keep up the character
of the race."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Nonsense!" said Athos," the
kings of France misers?  You are mad, my friend."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! you are so perfect
yourself, you never agree to the faults of others.  But, in
reality, Henry IV. was covetous, Louis XIII., his son, was so
likewise; we know something of that, don't we?  Gaston carried
this vice to exaggeration, and has made himself, in this respect,
hated by all who surround him.  Henriette, poor woman, might well
be avaricious, she who did not eat every day, and could not warm
herself every winter; and that is an example she has given to her
son Charles II., grandson of the great Henry IV., who is as
covetous as his mother and his grandfather.  See if I have well
traced the genealogy of the misers?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "D'Artagnan, my friend,"
cried Athos, "you are very rude towards that eagle race called
the Bourbons."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eh! and I have forgotten
the best instance of all - the other grandson of the
B&eacute;rnais, Louis XIV., my ex-master.  Well, I hope he is
miserly enough, he who would not lend a million to his brother
Charles!  Good!  I see you are beginning to be angry.  Here we
are, by good luck, close to my house, or rather that of my
friend, M. Monk."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My dear D'Artagnan, you do
not make me angry, you make me sad; it is cruel, in fact, to see
a man of your deserts out of the position his services ought to
have acquired; it appears to me, my dear friend, that your name
is as radiant as the greatest names in war and diplomacy.  Tell
me if the Luynes, the Ballegardes, and the Bassompierres have
merited, as we have, fortunes and honors?  You are right, my
friend, a hundred times right."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan sighed, and
preceded his friend under the porch of he mansion Monk inhabited,
at the extremity of the city.  "Permit me," said he, "to leave my
purse at home; for if in the crowd those clever pickpockets of
London, who are much boasted of, even in Paris, were to steal
from me the remainder of my poor crowns, I should not be able to
return to France.  Now, content I left France, and wild with joy
I should return to it, seeing that all my prejudices of former
days against England have returned, accompanied by many
others."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos made no reply.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So, then, my dear friend,
one second, and I will follow you," said D'Artagnan.  "I know you
are in a hurry to go yonder to receive your reward, but, believe
me, I am not less eager to partake of your joy, although from a
distance.  Wait for me."  And D'Artagnan was already passing
through the vestibule, when a man, half servant, half soldier,
who filled in Monk's establishment the double function of porter
and guard, stopped our musketeer, saying to him in English:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I beg your pardon, my Lord
d'Artagnan!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well," replied the latter:
"what is it?  Is the general going to dismiss me?  I only needed
to be expelled by him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                These words, spoken in
French, made no impression upon the person to whom they were
addressed, and who himself only spoke an English mixed with the
rudest Scots.  But Athos was grieved at them, for he began to
think D'Artagnan was not wrong.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The Englishman showed
D'Artagnan a letter: "From the general," said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Aye! that's it, my
dismissal!" replied the Gascon.  "Must I read it, Athos?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You must be deceived," said
Athos, "or I know no more honest people in the world but you and
myself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan shrugged his
shoulders and unsealed the letter, while the impassible
Englishman held for him a large lantern, by the light of which he
was enabled to read it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, what is the matter?"
said Athos, seeing the countenance of the reader change.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Read it yourself," said the
musketeer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos took the paper and
read:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN. - The
king regrets very much you did not come to St. Paul's with his
<i>cort&eacute;ge</i>.  He missed you, as I also have missed you,
my dear captain.  There is but one means of repairing all this. 
His majesty expects me at nine o'clock at the palace of St.
James's: will you be there at the same time with me?  His
gracious majesty appoints that hour for an audience he grants
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This letter was from
Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style='text-align:center'>
<span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Chapter XXXIII:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style='text-align:center'>The

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style='text-align:center'>
 </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>"W</span>ell?" cried
Athos with a mild look of reproach, when D'Artagnan had read the
letter addressed to him by Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well!" said D'Artagnan, red
with pleasure, and a little with shame, at having so hastily
accused the king and Monk.  "This is a politeness, - which leads
to nothing, it is true, but yet it is a politeness."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I had great difficulty in
believing the young prince ungrateful," said Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The fact is, that his
present is still too near his past," replied D'Artagnan; "after
all, everything to the present moment proved me right."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I acknowledge it, my dear
friend, I acknowledge it.  Ah! there is your cheerful look
returned.  You cannot think how delighted I am."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thus you see," said
D'Artagnan, "Charles II. receives M. Monk at nine o'clock; he
will receive me at ten; it is a grand audience, of the sort which
at the Louvre are called 'distributions of court holy water.' 
Come, let us go and place ourselves under the spout, my dear
friend!  Come along."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos replied nothing; and
both directed their steps, at a quick pace, towards the palace of
St. James's, which the crowd still surrounded, to catch, through
the windows, the shadows of the courtiers, and the reflection of
the royal person.  Eight o'clock was striking when the two
friends took their places in the gallery filled with courtiers
and politicians.  Every one looked at these simply-dressed men in
foreign costumes, at these two noble heads so full of character
and meaning.  On their side, Athos and D'Artagnan, having with
two glances taken the measure of the whole assembly, resumed
their chat.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                A great noise was suddenly
heard at the extremity of the gallery, - it was General Monk, who
entered, followed by more than twenty officers, all eager for a
smile, as only the evening before he was master of all England,
and a glorious to-morrow was looked to, for the restorer of the
Stuart family.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Gentlemen," said Monk,
turning round, "henceforward I beg you to remember that I am no
longer anything.  Lately I commanded the principal army of the
republic; now that army is the king's, into whose hands I am
about to surrender, at his command, my power of yesterday."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Great surprise was painted
on all the countenances, and the circle of adulators and
suppliants which surrounded Monk an instant before, was enlarged
by degrees, and ended by being lost in the large undulations of
the crowd.  Monk was going into the ante-chamber as others did. 
D'Artagnan could not help remarking this to the Comte de la
F&egrave;re, who frowned on beholding it.  Suddenly the door of
the royal apartment opened, and the young king appeared, preceded
by two officers of his household.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good evening, gentlemen,"
said he.  "Is General Monk here?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am here, sire," replied
the old general.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Charles stepped hastily
towards him, and seized his hand with the warmest demonstration
of friendship.  "General," said the king, aloud, "I have just
signed your patent, - you are Duke of Albemarle; and my intention
is that no one shall equal you in power and fortune in this
kingdom, where - the noble Montrose excepted - no one has equaled
you in loyalty, courage, and talent.  Gentlemen, the duke is
commander of our armies of land and sea; pay him your respects,
if you please, in that character."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Whilst every one was
pressing round the general, who received all this homage without
losing his impassibility for an instant, D'Artagnan said to
Athos: "When one thinks that this duchy, this commander of the
land and sea forces, all these grandeurs, in a word, have been
shut up in a box six feet long and three feet wide - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My friend," replied Athos,
"much more imposing grandeurs are confined in boxes still
smaller, - and remain there forever."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                All at once Monk perceived
the two gentlemen, who held themselves aside until the crowd had
diminished; he made himself a passage towards them, so that he
surprised them in the midst of their philosophical reflections. 
"Were you speaking of me?" sad he, with a smile.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord," replied Athos,
"we were speaking likewise of God."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk reflected for a moment,
and then replied gayly: "Gentlemen, let us speak a little of the
king likewise, if you please; for you have, I believe, an
audience of his majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "At nine o'clock," said
Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "At ten o'clock," said
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Let us go into this closet
at once," replied Monk, making a sign to his two companions to
precede him; but to that neither would consent.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king, during this
discussion so characteristic of the French, had returned to the
center of the gallery.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! my Frenchmen!" said he,
in that tone of careless gayety which, in spite of so much grief
and so many crosses, he had never lost.  "My Frenchmen! my
consolation!"  Athos and D'Artagnan bowed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Duke, conduct these
gentlemen into my study.  I am at your service, messieurs," added
he in French.  And he promptly expedited his court, to return to
his Frenchmen, as he called them.  "Monsieur d'Artagnan," said
he, as he entered his closet, "I am glad to see you again."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, my joy is at its
height, at having the honor to salute your majesty in your own
palace of St. James's."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, you have been
willing to render me a great service, and I owe you my gratitude
for it.  If I did not fear to intrude upon the rights of our
command general, I would offer you some post worthy of you near
our person."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire," replied D'Artagnan,
"I have quitted the service of the king of France, making a
promise to my prince not to serve any other king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Humph!" said Charles, "I am
sorry to hear that; I should like to do much for you; I like you
very much."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But, let us see," said
Charles with a smile, "if we cannot make you break your word. 
Duke, assist me.  If you were offered, that is to say, if I
offered you the chief command of my musketeers?"  D'Artagnan
bowed lower than before.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I should have the regret to
refuse what your gracious majesty would offer me," said he; "a
gentleman has but his word, and that word, as I have had the
honor to tell your majesty, is engaged to the king of
France."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "We shall say no more about
it, then," said the king, turning towards Athos, and leaving
D'Artagnan plunged in the deepest pangs of disappointment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah!  I said so!" muttered
the musketeer.  "Words! words!  Court holy water!  Kings have
always a marvelous talent for offering us that which they know we
will not accept, and in appearing generous without risk.  So be
it! - triple fool that I was to have hoped for a moment!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                During this time, Charles
took the hand of Athos.  "Comte," said he, "you have been to me a
second father; the services you have rendered to me are above all
price.  I have, nevertheless, thought of a recompense.  You were
created by my father a Knight of the Garter - that is an order
which all the kings of Europe cannot bear; by the queen regent,
Knight of the Holy Ghost - which is an order not less
illustrious; I join to it that of the Golden Fleece sent me by
the king of France, to whom the king of Spain, his father-in-law,
gave two on the occasion of his marriage; but in return, I have a
service to ask of you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire," said Athos, with
confusion, "the Golden Fleece for me! when the king of France is
the only person in my country who enjoys that distinction?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I wish you to be in your
country and all others the equal of all those whom sovereigns
have honored with their favor," said Charles, drawing the chain
from his neck; "and I am sure, comte, my father smiles on me from
his grave."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is unaccountably
strange," said D'Artagnan to himself, whilst his friend, on his
knees, received the eminent order which the king conferred on him
- "it is almost incredible that I have always seen showers of
prosperity fall upon all who surrounded me, and that not a drop
ever reached me!  If I were a jealous man, it would be enough to
make one tear one's hair, <i>parole d'honneur!</i>"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos rose from his knees,
and Charles embraced him tenderly.  "General!" said he to Monk -
then stopping, with a smile, "pardon me, duke, I mean.  No wonder
if I make a mistake; the word duke is too short for me, I always
seek some title to lengthen it.  I should wish to see you so near
my throne, that I might say to you, as to Louis XIV., my
brother!  Oh!  I have it; and you will almost be my brother, for
I make you viceroy of Ireland and Scotland, my dear duke.  So,
after that fashion, henceforward I shall not make a mistake."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The duke seized the hand of
the king, but without enthusiasm, without joy, as he did
everything.  His heart, however, had been moved by this last
favor.  Charles, by skillfully husbanding his generosity, had
given the duke time to wish, although he might not have wished
for so much as was given him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Mordioux!</i>" grumbled
D'Artagnan, "there is the shower beginning again!  Oh! it is
enough to turn one's brain!" and he turned away with an air so
sorrowful and so comically piteous, that the king, who caught it,
could not restrain a smile.  Monk was preparing to leave the
room, to take leave of Charles.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What! my trusty and
well-beloved!" said the king to the duke, "are you going?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "With your majesty's
permission, for in truth I am weary.  The emotions of the day
have worn me out; I stand in need of rest."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But," said the king, "you
are not going without M. d'Artagnan, I hope."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why not, sire?" said the
old warrior.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well! you know very well
why," said the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk looked at Charles with
astonishment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! it may be possible; but
if you forget, you, M. d'Artagnan, do not."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Astonishment was painted on
the face of the musketeer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, then, duke," said the
king, "do you not lodge with M. d'Artagnan?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I had the honor of offering
M. d'Artagnan a lodging; yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That idea is your own, and
yours solely?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Mine and mine only; yes,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well! but it could not be
otherwise - the prisoner always lodges with his conqueror."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk colored in his turn. 
"Ah! that is true," said he; "I am M. d'Artagnan's prisoner."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Without doubt, duke, since
you are not yet ransomed; but have no care of that; it was I who
took you out of M. d'Artagnan's hands, and it is I who will pay
your ransom."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The eyes of D'Artagnan
regained their gayety and their brilliancy.  The Gascon began to
understand.  Charles advanced towards him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The general," said he, "is
not rich, and cannot pay you what he is worth.  I am richer,
certainly; but now that he is a duke, and if not a king, almost a
king, he is worth a sum I could not perhaps pay.  Come, M.
d'Artagnan, be moderate with me; how much do I owe you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan, delighted at the
turn things were taking, but not for a moment losing his
self-possession, replied, - "Sire, your majesty has no occasion
to be alarmed.  When I had the good fortune to take his grace, M.
Monk was only a general; it is therefore only a general's ransom
that is due to me.  But if the general will have the kindness to
deliver me his sword, I shall consider myself paid; for there is
nothing in the world but the general's sword which is worth as
much as himself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Odds fish! as my father
said," cried Charles.  "That is a gallant proposal, and a gallant
man, is he not, duke?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Upon my honor, yes, sire,"
and he drew his sword.  "Monsieur," said he to D'Artagnan, "here
is what you demand.  Many have handled a better blade; but
however modest mine may be, I have never surrendered it to any
one."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan received with
pride the sword which had just made a king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! oh!" cried Charles II.;
"what a sword that has restored me to my throne - to go out of
the kingdom - and not, one day, to figure among the crown
jewels!  No, on my soul! that shall not be!  Captain d'Artagnan,
I will give you two hundred thousand livres for your sword!  If
that is too little, say so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is too little, sire,"
replied D'Artagnan, with inimitable seriousness.  "In the first
place, I do not at all wish to sell it; but your majesty desires
me to do so, and that is an order.  I obey, then, but the respect
I owe to the illustrious warrior who hears me, commands me to
estimate a third more the reward of my victory.  I ask then three
hundred thousand livres for the sword, or I shall give it to your
majesty for nothing."  And taking it by the point he presented it
to the king.  Charles broke into hilarious laughter.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A gallant man, and a merry
companion!  Odds fish! is he not, duke? is he not, comte?  He
pleases me!  I like him!  Here, Chevalier d'Artagnan, take
this."  And going to the table, he took a pen and wrote an order
upon his treasurer for three hundred thousand livres.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan took it, and
turning gravely towards Monk: "I have still asked too little, I
know," said he, "but believe me, your grace, I would rather have
died that allow myself to be governed by avarice."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king began to laugh
again, like the happiest cockney of his kingdom.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You will come and see me
again before you go, chevalier?" said he; "I shall want to lay in
a stock of gayety now my Frenchmen are leaving me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! sire, it will not be
with the gayety as with the duke's sword; I will give it to your
majesty gratis," replied D'Artagnan, whose feet scarcely seemed
to touch the ground.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you, comte," added
Charles, turning towards Athos, "come again, also; I have an
important message to confide to you.  Your hand, duke."  Monk
pressed the hand of the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Adieu! gentlemen," said
Charles, holding out each of his hands to the two Frenchmen, who
carried them to their lips.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well," said Athos, when
they were out of the palace, "are you satisfied?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Hush!" said D'Artagnan,
wild with joy, "I have not yet returned from the treasurer's - a
shutter may fall upon my head."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style='text-align:center'>Of
the Embarrassment of Riches.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>D</span>'Artagnan
lost no time, and as soon as the thing was suitable and
opportune, he paid a visit to the lord treasurer of his majesty. 
He had then the satisfaction to exchange a piece of paper,
covered with very ugly writing, for a prodigious number of
crowns, recently stamped with the <i>effigies</i> of his very
gracious majesty Charles II.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan easily controlled
himself: and yet, on this occasion, he could not help evincing a
joy which the reader will perhaps comprehend, if he deigns to
have some indulgence for a man who, since his birth, had never
seen so many pieces and rolls of pieces juxta-placed in an order
truly agreeable to the eye.  The treasurer placed all the rolls
in bags, and closed each bag with a stamp sealed with the arms of
England, a favor which treasurers do not grant to everybody. 
Then, impassible, and just as polite as he ought to be towards a
man honored with the friendship of the king, he said to
D'Artagnan:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Take away your money,
sir."  <i>Your money!</i>  These words made a thousand chords
vibrate in the heart of D'Artagnan, which he had never felt
before.  He had the bags packed in a small cart, and returned
home meditating deeply.  A man who possessed three hundred
thousand livres can no longer expect to wear a smooth brow; a
wrinkle for every hundred thousand livres is not too much.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan shut himself up,
ate no dinner, closed his door to everybody, and, with a lighted
lamp, and a loaded pistol on the table, he watched all night,
ruminating upon the means of preventing these lovely crowns,
which from the coffers of the king had passed into his coffers,
from passing from his coffers into the pockets of any thief
whatever.  The best means discovered by the Gascon was to inclose
his treasure, for the present, under locks so solid that no wrist
could break them, and so complicated that no master-key could
open them.  D'Artagnan remembered that the English are masters in
mechanics and conservative industry; and he determined to go in
the morning in search of a mechanic who would sell him a strong
box.  He did not go far; Master Will Jobson, dwelling in
Piccadilly, listened to his propositions, comprehended his
wishes, and promised to make him a safety lock that should
relieve him from all future fear.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I will give you," said he,
"a piece of mechanism entirely new.  At the first serious attempt
upon your lock, an invisible plate will open of itself and vomit
forth a pretty copper bullet the weight of a mark - which will
knock down the intruder, and not with a loud report.  What do you
think of it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I think it very ingenuous,"
cried D'Artagnan; "the little copper bullet pleases me mightily. 
So now, sir mechanic, the terms?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A fortnight for the
execution, and fifteen hundred livres payable on delivery,"
replied the artisan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan's brow darkened. 
A fortnight was delay enough to allow the thieves of London time
to remove all occasion for the strong box.  As to the fifteen
hundred livres - that would be paying too dear for what a little
vigilance would procure him for nothing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I will think of it," said
he; "thank you, sir."  And he returned home at full speed; nobody
had yet touched his treasure.  That same day Athos paid a visit
to his friend and found him so thoughtful that he could not help
expressing his surprise.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How is this?" said he, "you
are rich and not gay - you, who were so anxious for wealth!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My friend, the pleasures to
which we are not accustomed oppress us more than the griefs with
which we are familiar.  Give me your opinion, if you please.  I
can ask you, who have always had money: when we have money, what
do we do with it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That depends."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What have you done with
yours, seeing that it has not made you a miser or a prodigal? 
For avarice dries up the heart, and prodigality drowns it - is
that not so?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Fabricius could not have
spoken more justly.  But in truth, my money has never been a
burden to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How so?  Do you place it
out at interest?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No; you know I have a
tolerably handsome house; and that house composes the better part
of my property."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I know it does."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So that you can be as rich
as I am, and, indeed, more rich, whenever you like, by the same
means."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But your rents, - do you
lay them by?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What do you think of a
chest concealed in a wall?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I never made use of such a
thing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then you must have some
confidant, some safe man of business who pays you interest at a
fair rate."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Not at all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good heavens! what do you
do with it, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I spend all I have, and I
only have what I spend, my dear D'Artagnan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! that may be.  But you
are something of a prince; fifteen or sixteen thousand livres
melt away between your fingers; and then you have expenses and
appearances - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, I don't see why you
should be less of a noble than I am, my friend; your money would
be quite sufficient."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Three hundred thousand
livres!  Two-thirds too much!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I beg your pardon - did you
not tell me? - I thought I heard you say - I fancied you had a
partner - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah!  <i>Mordioux!</i>
that's true," cried D'Artagnan, coloring; "there is Planchet.  I
had forgotten Planchet, upon my life!  Well! there are my three
hundred thousand livres broken into.  That's a pity! it was a
round sum, and sounded well.  That is true, Athos; I am no longer
rich.  What a memory you have!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Tolerably good; yes, thank
God!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The worthy Planchet!"
grumbled D'Artagnan; "his was not a bad dream!  What a
speculation!  <i>Peste!</i>  Well! what is said is said."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How much are you to give
him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!" said D'Artagnan, "he
is not a bad fellow; I shall arrange matters with him.  I have
had a great deal of trouble, you see, and expenses; all that must
be taken into account."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My dear friend, I can
depend on you, and have no fear for the worthy Planchet; his
interests are better in your hands than in his own.  But now that
you have nothing more to do here, we shall depart, if you
please.  You can go and thank his majesty, ask if he has any
commands, and in six days we may be able to get sight of the
towers of Notre Dame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My friend, I am most
anxious to be off, and will go at once and pay my respects to the
king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I," said Athos, "am going
to call upon some friends in the city, and shall then be at your
service."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Will you lend me
Grimaud?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "With all my heart.  What do
you want to do with him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Something very simple, and
which will not fatigue him; I shall only beg him to take charge
of my pistols, which lie there on the table near that
coffer."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very well!" replied Athos,
imperturbably.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And he will not stir, will
he?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Not more than the pistols
themselves."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then I shall go and take
leave of his majesty.  <i>Au revoir!</i>"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan arrived at St.
James's, where Charles II., who was busy writing, kept him in the
ante-chamber a full hour.  Whilst walking about in the gallery,
from the door to the window, from the window to the door, he
thought he saw a cloak like Athos's cross the vestibule; but at
the moment he was going to ascertain if it were he, the usher
summoned him to his majesty's presence.  Charles II. rubbed his
hands while receiving the thanks of our friend.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Chevalier," said he, "you
are wrong to express gratitude to me; I have not paid you a
quarter of the value of the history of the box into which you put
the brave general - the excellent Duke of Albemarle, I mean." 
And the king laughed heartily.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan did not think it
proper to interrupt his majesty, and he bowed with much
modesty.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>A propos</i>," continued
Charles, "do you think my dear Monk has really pardoned you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Pardoned me! yes, I hope
so, sire!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eh! - but it was a cruel
trick!  Odds fish! to pack up the first personage of the English
revolution like a herring.  In your place I would not trust him,
chevalier."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But, sire - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, I know very well Monk
calls you his friend, but he has too penetrating an eye not to
have a memory, and too lofty a brow not to be very proud, you
know, <i>grande supercilium</i>."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I shall certainly learn
Latin," said D'Artagnan to himself.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But stop," cried the merry
monarch, "I must manage your reconciliation; I know how to set
about it; so - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan bit his
mustache.  "Will your majesty permit me to tell you the
truth?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Speak, chevalier,
speak."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, sire, you alarm me
greatly.  If your majesty undertakes the affair, as you seem
inclined to do, I am a lost man; the duke will have me
assassinated."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king burst into a fresh
roar of laughter, which changed D'Artagnan's alarm into downright
terror.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, I beg you to allow me
to settle this matter myself, and if your majesty has no further
need of my services - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, chevalier.  What, do
you want to leave us?" replied Charles, with a hilarity that grew
more and more alarming.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "If your majesty has no more
commands for me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Charles became more
serious.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "One single thing.  See my
sister, the Lady Henrietta.  Do you know her?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, sire, but - an old
soldier like me is not an agreeable spectacle for a young and gay
princess."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! but my sister must know
you; she must in case of need have you to depend upon."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, every one that is
dear to your majesty will be sacred to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very well! - Parry!  Come
here, Parry!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The side door opened and
Parry entered, his face beaming with pleasure as soon as he saw
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What is Rochester doing?"
said the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He is on the canal with the
ladies," replied Parry.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And Buckingham?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He is there also."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is well.  You will
conduct the chevalier to Villiers; that is the Duke of
Buckingham, chevalier; and beg the duke to introduce M.
d'Artagnan to the Princess Henrietta."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Parry bowed and smiled to
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Chevalier," continued the
king, "this is your parting audience; you can afterwards set out
as soon as you please."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, I thank you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But be sure you make your
peace with Monk!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, sire - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You know there is one of my
vessels at your disposal?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, you overpower me; I
cannot think of putting your majesty's officers to inconvenience
on my account."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king slapped D'Artagnan
upon the shoulder.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Nobody will be
inconvenienced on your account, chevalier, but for that of an
ambassador I am about sending to France, and to whom you will
willingly serve as a companion, I fancy, for you know him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan appeared
astonished.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He is a certain Comte de la
F&egrave;re, - whom you call Athos," added the king; terminating
the conversation, as he had begun it, by a joyous burst of
laughter.  "Adieu, chevalier, adieu.  Love me as I love you." 
And thereupon, making a sign to Parry to ask if there were any
one waiting for him in the adjoining closet, the king disappeared
into that closet, leaving the chevalier perfectly astonished by
this singular audience.  The old man took his arm in a friendly
way, and led him towards the garden.</p>

waters of the canal bordered with marble, upon which time had
already scattered black spots and tufts of mossy grass, there
glided majestically a long, flat bark adorned with the arms of
England, surmounted by a dais, and carpeted with long damasked
stuffs, which trailed their fringes in the water.  Eight rowers,
leaning lazily to their oars, made it move upon the canal with
the graceful slowness of the swans, which, disturbed in their
ancient possessions by the approach of the bark, looked from a
distance at this splendid and noisy pageant.  We say noisy - for
the bark contained four guitar and lute players, two singers, and
several courtiers, all sparkling with gold and precious stones,
and showing their white teeth in emulation of each other, to
please the Lady Henrietta Stuart, grand-daughter of Henry IV.,
daughter of Charles I., and sister of Charles II., who occupied
the seat of honor under the dais of the bark.  We know this young
princess, we have seen her at the Louvre with her mother, wanting
wood, wanting bread, and fed by the <i>coadjuteur</i> and the
parliament.  She had, therefore, like her brothers, passed
through an uneasy youth; then, all at once, she had just awakened
from a long and horrible dream, seated on the steps of a throne,
surrounded by courtiers and flatterers.  Like Mary Stuart on
leaving prison, she aspired not only to life and liberty, but to
power and wealth.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The Lady Henrietta, in
growing, had attained remarkable beauty, which the recent
restoration had rendered celebrated.  Misfortune had taken from
her the luster of pride, but prosperity had restored it to her. 
She was resplendent, then, in her joy and her happiness, - like
those hot-house flowers which, forgotten during a frosty autumn
night, have hung their heads, but which on the morrow, warmed
once more by the atmosphere in which they were born, rise again
with greater splendor than ever.  Villiers, Duke of Buckingham,
son of him who played so conspicuous a part in the early chapters
of this history, - Villiers of Buckingham, a handsome cavalier,
melancholy with women, a jester with men, - and Wilmot, Lord
Rochester, a jester with both sexes, were standing at this moment
before the Lady Henrietta, disputing the privilege of making her
smile.  As to that young and beautiful princess, reclining upon a
cushion of velvet bordered with gold, her hands hanging
listlessly so as to dip in the water, she listened carelessly to
the musicians without hearing them, and heard the two courtiers
without appearing to listen to them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This Lady Henrietta - this
charming creature - this woman who joined the graces of France to
the beauties of England, not having yet loved, was cruel in her
coquetry.  The smile, then, - that innocent favor of young girls,
- did not even lighten her countenance; and if, at times, she did
raise her eyes, it was to fasten them upon one or other of the
cavaliers with such a fixity, that their gallantry, bold as it
generally was, took the alarm, and became timid.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                In the meanwhile the boat
continued its course, the musicians made a great noise, and the
courtiers began, like them, to be out of breath.  Besides, the
excursion became doubtless monotonous to the princess, for all at
once, shaking her head with an air of impatience, - "Come
gentlemen, - enough of this; - let us land."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, madam," said
Buckingham, "we are very unfortunate!  We have not succeeded in
making the excursion agreeable to your royal highness."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My mother expects me,"
replied the princess; "and I must frankly admit, gentlemen, I am
bored."  And whilst uttering this cruel word, Henrietta
endeavored to console by a look each of the two young men, who
appeared terrified at such frankness.  The look produced its
effect - the two faces brightened; but immediately, as if the
royal coquette thought she had done too much for simple mortals,
she made a movement, turned her back on both her adorers, and
appeared plunged in a reverie in which it was evident they had no
part.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Buckingham bit his lips with
anger, for he was truly in love with the Lady Henrietta, and, in
that case, took everything in a serious light.  Rochester bit his
lips likewise; but his wit always dominated over his heart, it
was purely and simply to repress a malicious smile.  The princess
was then allowing the eyes she turned from the young nobles to
wander over the green and flowery turf of the park, when she
perceived Parry and D'Artagnan at a distance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who is coming yonder?" said
she.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The two young men turned
round with the rapidity of lightning.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Parry," replied Buckingham;
"nobody but Parry."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I beg your pardon," said
Rochester, "but I think he has a companion."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes," said the princess, at
first with languor, but then, - "What mean those words, 'Nobody
but Parry;' say, my lord?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Because, madam," replied
Buckingham, piqued, "because the faithful Parry, the wandering
Parry, the eternal Parry, is not, I believe, of much
consequence."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are mistaken, duke. 
Parry - the wandering Parry, as you call him - has always
wandered in the service of my family, and the sight of that old
man always gives me satisfaction."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The Lady Henrietta followed
the usual progress of pretty women, particularly coquettish
women; she passed from caprice to contradiction; - the gallant
had undergone the caprice, the courtier must bend beneath the
contradictory humor.  Buckingham bowed, but made no reply.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is true, madam," said
Rochester, bowing in his turn, "that Parry is the model of
servants; but, madam, he is no longer young, and we laugh only
when we see cheerful objects.  Is an old man a gay object?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Enough, my lord," said the
princess, coolly; "the subject of conversation is unpleasant to
me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Then, as if speaking to
herself, "It is really unaccountable," said she, "how little
regard my brother's friends have for his servants."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, madam," cried
Buckingham, "your royal highness pierces my heart with a dagger
forged by your own hands."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What is the meaning of that
speech, which is turned so like a French madrigal, duke?  I do
not understand it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It means, madam, that you
yourself, so good, so charming, so sensible, you have laughed
sometimes - smiled, I should say - at the idle prattle of that
good Parry, for whom your royal highness to-day entertains such a
marvelous susceptibility."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, my lord, if I have
forgotten myself so far," said Henrietta, "you do wrong to remind
me of it."  And she made a sign of impatience.  "The good Parry
wants to speak to me, I believe: please order them to row to the
shore, my Lord Rochester."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Rochester hastened to repeat
the princess's command; and a moment later the boat touched the
bank.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Let us land, gentlemen,"
said Henrietta, taking the arm which Rochester offered her,
although Buckingham was nearer to her, and had presented his. 
Then Rochester, with an ill-dissembled pride, which pierced the
heart of the unhappy Buckingham through and through, led the
princess across the little bridge which the rowers had cast from
the royal boat to the shore.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Which way will your
highness go?" asked Rochester.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You see, my lord, towards
that good Parry, who is wandering, as my lord of Buckingham says,
and seeking me with eyes weakened by the tears he has shed over
our misfortunes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good heavens!" said
Rochester, "how sad your royal highness is to-day; in truth we
seem ridiculous fools to you, madam."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Speak for yourself, my
lord," interrupted Buckingham with vexation; "for my part, I
displease her royal highness to such a degree, that I appear
absolutely nothing to her."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Neither Rochester nor the
princess made any reply; Henrietta only urged her companion more
quickly on.  Buckingham remained behind, and took advantage of
this isolation to give himself up to his anger; he bit his
handkerchief so furiously that it was soon in shreds.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Parry, my good Parry," said
the princess, with her gentle voice, "come hither.  I see you are
seeking me, and I am waiting for you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, madam," said Rochester,
coming charitably to the help of his companion, who had remained,
as we have said, behind, "if Parry cannot see your royal
highness, the man who follows him is a sufficient guide, even for
a blind man; for he has eyes of flame.  That man is a
double-lamped lantern."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Lighting a very handsome
martial countenance," said the princess, determined to be as
ill-natured as possible.  Rochester bowed.  "One of those
vigorous soldiers' heads seen nowhere but in France," added the
princess, with the perseverance of a woman sure of impunity.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Rochester and Buckingham
looked at each other, as much as to say, - "What can be the
matter with her?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "See, my lord of Buckingham,
what Parry wants," said Henrietta.  "Go!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The young man, who
considered this order as a favor, resumed his courage, and
hastened to meet Parry, who, followed by D'Artagnan, advanced
slowly on account of his age.  D'Artagnan walked slowly but
nobly, as D'Artagnan, doubled by the third of a million, ought to
walk, that is to say, without conceit or swagger, but without
timidity.  When Buckingham, very eager to comply with the desire
of the princess, who had seated herself on a marble bench, as if
fatigued with the few steps she had gone, - when Buckingham, we
say, was at a distance of only a few paces from Parry, the latter
recognized him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! my lord!" cried he,
quite out of breath, "will your grace obey the king?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In what, Mr. Parry?" said
the young man, with a kind of coolness tempered by a desire to
make himself agreeable to the princess.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, his majesty begs your
grace to present this gentleman to her royal highness the
Princess Henrietta."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In the first place, what is
the gentleman's name?" said the duke, haughtily.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan, as we know, was
easily affronted, and the Duke of Buckingham's tone displeased
him.  He surveyed the courtier from head to foot, and two flashes
beamed from beneath his bent brows.  But, after a struggle, -
"Monsieur le Chevalier d'Artagnan, my lord," replied he,
quietly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Pardon me, sir, that
teaches me your name, but nothing more."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You mean - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I mean I do not know
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am more fortunate than
you, sir," replied D'Artagnan, "for I have had the honor of
knowing your family, and particularly my lord Duke of Buckingham,
your illustrious father."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My father?" said
Buckingham.  "Well, I think I now remember.  Monsieur le
Chevalier d'Artagnan, do you say?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan bowed.  "In
person," said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Pardon me, but are you one
of those Frenchmen who had secret relations with my father?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Exactly, my lord duke, I am
one of those Frenchmen."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then, sir, permit me to say
that it was strange my father never heard of you during his
lifetime."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, monsieur, but he heard
of me at the moment of his death: it was I who sent to him,
through the hands of the <i>valet de chambre</i> of Anne of
Austria, notice of the dangers which threatened him;
unfortunately, it came too late."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Never mind, monsieur," said
Buckingham.  "I understand now, that, having had the intention of
rendering a service to the father, you have come to claim the
protection of the son."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In the first place, my
lord," replied D'Artagnan, phlegmatically, "I claim the
protection of no man.  His majesty, Charles II., to whom I have
had the honor of rendering some services - I may tell you, my
lord, my life has been passed in such occupations - King Charles
II., then, who wishes to honor me with some kindness, desires me
to be presented to her royal highness the Princess Henrietta, his
sister, to whom I shall, perhaps, have the good fortune to be of
service hereafter.  Now, the king knew that you at this moment
were with her royal highness, and sent me to you.  There is no
other mystery, I ask absolutely nothing of you; and if you will
not present me to her royal highness, I shall be compelled to do
without you, and present myself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "At least, sir," said
Buckingham, determined to have the last word, "you will not
refuse me an explanation provoked by yourself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I never refuse, my lord,"
said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "As you have had relations
with my father, you must be acquainted with some private
details?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "These relations are already
far removed from us, my lord - for you were not then born - and
for some unfortunate diamond studs, which I received from his
hands and carried back to France, it is really not worth while
awakening so many remembrances."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! sir," said Buckingham,
warmly, going up to D'Artagnan, and holding out his hand to him,
"it is you, then - you whom my father sought everywhere and who
had a right to expect so much from us."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To expect, my lord, in
truth, that is my <i>forte</i>; all my life I have expected."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                At this moment, the
princess, who was tired of not seeing the stranger approach her,
arose and came towards them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "At least, sir," said
Buckingham, "you shall not wait for the presentation you claim of
me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Then turning towards the
princess and bowing: "Madam," said the young man, "the king, your
brother, desires me to have the honor of presenting to your royal
highness, Monsieur le Chevalier d'Artagnan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In order that your royal
highness may have, in case of need, a firm support and a sure
friend," added Parry.  D'Artagnan bowed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You have still something to
say, Parry," replied Henrietta, smiling upon D'Artagnan, while
addressing the old servant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, madam, the king
desires you to preserve religiously in your memory the name and
merit of M. d'Artagnan, to whom his majesty owes, he says, the
recovery of his kingdom."  Buckingham, the princess, and
Rochester looked at each other.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That," said D'Artagnan, "is
another little secret, of which, in all probability, I shall not
boast to his majesty's son, as I have done to you with respect to
the diamond studs."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Madam," said Buckingham,
"monsieur has just, for the second time, recalled to my memory an
event which excites my curiosity to such a degree, that I shall
venture to ask your permission to take him to one side for a
moment, to converse in private."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do, my lord," said the
princess; "but restore to the sister, as quickly as possible,
this friend so devoted to the brother."  And she took the arm of
Rochester, whilst Buckingham took that of D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! tell me, chevalier,"
said Buckingham, "all that affair of the diamonds, which nobody
knows in England, not even the son of him who was the hero of
it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord, one person alone
had a right to relate all that affair, as you call it, and that
was your father; he thought it proper to be silent, I must beg
you to allow me to be so likewise."  And D'Artagnan bowed like a
man upon whom it was evident no entreaties could prevail.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Since it is so, sir," said
Buckingham, "pardon my indiscretion, I beg you; and if, at any
time, I should go into France - " and he turned round to take a
last look at the princess, who took but little notice of him,
totally occupied as she was, or appeared to be, with Rochester. 
Buckingham sighed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well?" said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I was saying that if, any
day, I were to go to France - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You will go, my lord," said
D'Artagnan, "I shall answer for that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And how so?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, I have strange powers
of prediction; if I do predict anything I am seldom mistaken. 
If, then, you do come to France?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, then, monsieur, you,
of whom kings ask that valuable friendship which restores crowns
to them, I will venture to beg of you a little of that great
interest you took in my father."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord," replied
D'Artagnan, "believe me, I shall deem myself highly honored if,
in France, you remember having seen me here.  And now permit -
"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Then, turning towards the
princess: "Madam," said he, "your royal highness is a daughter of
France; and in that quality I hope to see you again in Paris. 
One of my happy days will be on that on which your royal highness
shall give me any command whatever, thus proving to me that you
have not forgotten the recommendations of your august brother." 
And he bowed respectfully to the young princess, who gave him her
hand to kiss with a right royal grace.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! madam," said
Buckingham, in a subdued voice, "what can a man do to obtain a
similar favor from your royal highness?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Dame!</i> my lord,"
replied Henrietta, "ask Monsieur d'Artagnan; he will tell
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>T</span>he king's
words regarding the wounded pride of Monk had inspired D'Artagnan
with no small portion of apprehension.  The lieutenant had had,
all his life, the great art of choosing his enemies; and when he
had found them implacable and invincible, it was when he had not
been able, under any pretense, to make them otherwise.  But
points of view change greatly in the course of a life.  It is a
magic lantern, of which the eye of man every year changes the
aspects.  It results that from the last day of a year on which we
saw white, to the first day of the year on which we shall see
black, there is the interval of but a single night.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Now, D'Artagnan, when he
left Calais with his ten scamps, would have hesitated as little
in attacking a Goliath, a Nebuchadnezzar, or a Holofernes, as he
would in crossing swords with a recruit or caviling with a
land-lady.  Then he resembled the sparrow-hawk, which, when
fasting, will attack a ram.  Hunger is blind.  But D'Artagnan
satisfied - D'Artagnan rich - D'Artagnan a conqueror - D'Artagnan
proud of so difficult a triumph - D'Artagnan had too much to lose
not to reckon, figure by figure, with probable misfortune.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                His thoughts were employed,
therefore, all the way on the road from his presentation, with
one thing, and that was, how he should conciliate a man like
Monk, a man whom Charles himself, king as he was, conciliated
with difficulty; for, scarcely established, the protected might
again stand in need of the protector, and would, consequently,
not refuse him, such being the case, the petty satisfaction of
transporting M. d'Artagnan, or of confining him in one of the
Middlesex prisons, or drowning him a little on his passage from
Dover to Boulogne.  Such sorts of satisfaction kings are
accustomed to render to viceroys without disagreeable
consequences.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                It would not be at all
necessary for the king to be active in that <i>contrepartie</i>
of the play in which Monk should take his revenge.  The part of
the king would be confined to simply pardoning the viceroy of
Ireland all he should undertake against D'Artagnan.  Nothing more
was necessary to place the conscience of the Duke of Albemarle at
rest than a <i>te absolvo</i> said with a laugh, or the scrawl of
"Charles the King," traced at the foot of a parchment; and with
these two words pronounced, and these two words written, poor
D'Artagnan was forever crushed beneath the ruins of his
imagination.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                And then, a thing
sufficiently disquieting for a man with such foresight as our
musketeer, he found himself alone; and even the friendship of
Athos could not restore his confidence.  Certainly if the affair
had only concerned a free distribution of sword-thrusts, the
musketeer would have counted upon his companion; but in delicate
dealings with a king, when the <i>perhaps</i> of an unlucky
chance should arise in justification of Monk or of Charles of
England, D'Artagnan knew Athos well enough to be sure he would
give the best possible coloring to the loyalty of the survivor,
and would content himself with shedding floods of tears on the
tomb of the dead, supposing the dead to be his friend, and
afterwards composing his epitaph in the most pompous
superlatives.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Decidedly," thought the
Gascon; and this thought was the result of the reflections which
he had just whispered to himself and which we have repeated aloud
- "decidedly, I must be reconciled with M. Monk, and acquire
proof of his perfect indifference for the past.  If, and God
forbid it should be so! he is still sulky and reserved in the
expression of this sentiment, I shall give my money to Athos to
take away with him, and remain in England just long enough to
unmask him, then, as I have a quick eye and a light foot, I shall
notice the first hostile sign; to decamp or conceal myself at the
residence of my lord Buckingham, who seems a good sort of devil
at the bottom, and to whom, in return for his hospitality, I
shall relate all that history of the diamonds, which can now
compromise nobody but an old queen, who need not be ashamed,
after being the wife of a miserly creature like Mazarin, of
having formerly been the mistress of a handsome nobleman like
Buckingham.  <i>Mordioux!</i> that is the thing, and this Monk
shall not get the better of me.  Eh? and besides I have an
idea!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                We know that, in general,
D'Artagnan was not wanting in ideas; and during this soliloquy,
D'Artagnan buttoned his vest up to the chin, and nothing excited
his imagination like this preparation for a combat of any kind,
called <i>accinction</i> by the Romans.  He was quite heated when
he reached the mansion of the Duke of Albemarle.  He was
introduced to the viceroy with a promptitude which proved that he
was considered as one of the household.  Monk was in his
business-closet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord," said D'Artagnan,
with that expression of frankness which the Gascon knew so well
how to assume, "my lord, I have come to ask your grace's
advice!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk, as closely buttoned up
morally as his antagonist was physically, replied: "Ask, my
friend;" and his countenance presented an expression not less
open than that of D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord, in the first
place, promise me secrecy and indulgence."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I promise you all you
wish.  What is the matter?  Speak!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is, my lord, that I am
not quite pleased with the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Indeed!  And on what
account, my dear lieutenant?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Because his majesty gives
way sometimes to jests very compromising for his servants; and
jesting, my lord, is a weapon that seriously wounds men of the
sword, as we are."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk did all in his power
not to betray his thought, but D'Artagnan watched him with too
close attention not to detect an almost imperceptible flush upon
his face.  "Well, now, for my part," said he, with the most
natural air possible, "I am not an enemy of jesting, my dear
Monsieur d'Artagnan; my soldiers will tell you that even many
times in camp, I listened very indifferently, and with a certain
pleasure, to the satirical songs which the army of Lambert passed
into mine, and which, certainly, would have caused the ears of a
general more susceptible than I am to tingle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, my lord," said
D'Artagnan, "I know you are a complete man; I know you have been,
for a long time, placed above human miseries; but there are jests
and jests of a certain kind, which have the power of irritating
me beyond expression."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "May I inquire what kind, my
friend?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Such as are directed
against my friends or against people I respect, my lord!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk made a slight movement,
which D'Artagnan perceived.  "Eh! and in what," asked Monk, "in
what can the stroke of a pin which scratches another tickle your
skin?  Answer me that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord, I can explain it
to you in a single sentence; it concerns you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk advanced a single step
towards D'Artagnan.  "Concerns me?" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, and this is what I
cannot explain; but that arises, perhaps, from my want of
knowledge of his character.  How can the king have the heart to
jest about a man who has rendered him so many and such great
services?  How can one understand that he should amuse himself in
setting by the ears a lion like you with a gnat like me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I cannot conceive that in
any way," said Monk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But so it is.  The king,
who owed me a reward, might have rewarded me as a soldier,
without contriving that history of the ransom, which affects you,
my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No," said Monk, laughing:
"it does not affect me in any way, I can assure you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Not as regards me, I can
understand; you know me, my lord, I am so discreet that the grave
would appear a babbler compared to me; but - do you understand,
my lord?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No," replied Monk, with
persistent obstinacy.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "If another knew the secret
which I know - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What secret?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eh! my lord, why, that
unfortunate secret of Newcastle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! the million of the
Comte de la F&egrave;re?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, my lord, no; the
enterprise made upon your grace's person."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It was well played,
chevalier, that is all, and no more is to be said about it: you
are a soldier, both brave and cunning, which proves that you
unite the qualities of Fabius and Hannibal.  You employed your
means, force and cunning: there is nothing to be said against
that: I ought to have been on guard."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! yes; I know, my lord,
and I expected nothing less from your partiality; so that if it
were only the abduction in itself, <i>Mordioux!</i> that would be
nothing; but there are - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The circumstances of that
abduction."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What circumstances?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! you know very well what
I mean, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, curse me if I do."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "There is - in truth, it is
difficult to speak it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "There is?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, there is that devil
of a box!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk colored visibly. 
"Well, I have forgotten it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Deal box," continued
D'Artagnan, "with holes for the nose and mouth.  In truth, my
lord, all the rest was well; but the box, the box! that was
really a coarse joke."  Monk fidgeted about in his chair.  "And,
notwithstanding my having done that," resumed D'Artagnan, "I, a
soldier of fortune, it was quite simple, because by the side of
that action, a little inconsiderate I admit, which I committed,
but which the gravity of the case may excuse, I am circumspect
and reserved."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!" said Monk, "believe
me, I know you well, Monsieur d'Artagnan, and I appreciate
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan never took his
eyes off Monk; studying all which passed in the mind of the
general, as he prosecuted <i>his idea.</i>  "But it does not
concern me," resumed he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, then, who does it
concern?" said Monk, who began to grow a little impatient.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It relates to the king, who
will never restrain his tongue."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well! and suppose he should
say all he knows?" said Monk, with a degree of hesitation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord," replied
D'Artagnan, "do not dissemble, I implore you, with a man who
speaks so frankly as I do.  You have a right to feel your
susceptibility excited, however benignant it may be.  What, the
devil! it is not the place for a man like you, a man who plays
with crowns and scepters as a Bohemian plays with his balls; it
is not the place of a serious man, I said, to be shut up in a box
like some freak of natural history; for you must understand it
would make all your enemies ready to burst with laughter, and you
are so great, so noble, so generous, that you must have many
enemies.  This secret is enough to set half the human race
laughing, if you were represented in that box.  It is not decent
to have the second personage in the kingdom laughed at."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk was quite out of
countenance at the idea of seeing himself represented in this
box.  Ridicule, as D'Artagnan had judiciously foreseen, acted
upon him in a manner which neither the chances of war, the
aspirations of ambition, nor the fear of death had been able to
do.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good," thought the Gascon,
"he is frightened: I am safe."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! as to the king," said
Monk, "fear nothing, my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan; the king will
not jest with Monk, I assure you!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The momentary flash of his
eye was noticed by D'Artagnan.  Monk lowered his tone
immediately: "The king," continued he, "is of too noble a nature,
the king's heart is too high to allow him to wish ill to those
who do him good."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! certainly," cried
D'Artagnan.  "I am entirely of your grace's opinion with regard
to his heart, but not as to his head - it is good, but it is
trifling."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The king will not trifle
with Monk, be assured."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then you are quite at ease,
my lord?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "On that side, at least!
yes, perfectly!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!  I understand you; you
are at ease as far as the king is concerned?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have told you I was."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But you are not so much so
on my account?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I thought I had told you
that I had faith in your loyalty and discretion."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No doubt, no doubt, but you
must remember one thing - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What is that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That I was not alone, that
I had companions; and what companions!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! yes, I know them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And, unfortunately, my
lord, they know you, too!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well; they are yonder, at
Boulogne, waiting for me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you fear - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, I fear that in my
absence - <i>Parbleu!</i>  If I were near them, I could answer
for their silence."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Was I not right in saying
that the danger, if there was any danger, would not come from his
majesty, however disposed he may be to jest, but from your
companions, as you say?  To be laughed at by a king may be
tolerable, but by the horse-boys and scamps of the army!  Damn
it!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, I understand, that
would be unbearable; that is why, my lord, I came to say, - do
you not think it would be better for me to set out for France as
soon as possible?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Certainly, if you think
your presence - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Would impose silence upon
those scoundrels?  Oh!  I am sure of that, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your presence will not
prevent the report from spreading, if the tale has already
transpired."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! it has not transpired,
my lord, I will wager.  At all events, be assured that I am
determined upon one thing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What is that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To blow out the brains of
the first who shall have propagated that report, and of the first
who has heard it.  After which I shall return to England to seek
an asylum, and perhaps employment with your grace."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, come back! come
back!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Unfortunately, my lord, I
am acquainted with nobody here but your grace, and if I should no
longer find you, or if you should have forgotten me in your
greatness?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Listen to me, Monsieur
d'Artagnan," replied Monk; "you are a superior man, full of
intelligence and courage; you deserve all the good fortune this
world can bring you; come with me into Scotland, and, I swear to
you, I shall arrange for you a fate which all may envy."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! my lord, that is
impossible.  At present I have a sacred duty to perform; I have
to watch over your glory, I have to prevent a low jester from
tarnishing in the eyes of our contemporaries - who knows? in the
eyes of posterity - the splendor of your name."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Of posterity, Monsieur
d'Artagnan?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Doubtless.  It is
necessary, as regards posterity, that all the details of that
history should remain a mystery; for, admit that this unfortunate
history of the deal box should spread, and it should be asserted
that you had not re-established the king loyally, and of your own
free will, but in consequence of a compromise entered into at
Scheveningen between you two.  It would be vain for me to declare
how the thing came about, for though I know I should not be
believed, it would be said that I had received my part of the
cake, and was eating it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monk knitted his brow. -
"Glory, honor, probity!" said he, "you are but empty words."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Mist!" replied D'Artagnan;
"nothing but mist, through which nobody can see clearly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, then, go to France,
my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan," said Monk; "go, and to render
England more attractive and agreeable to you, accept a
remembrance of me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What now?" thought
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have on the banks of the
Clyde," continued Monk, "a little house in a grove, cottage as it
is called here.  To this house are attached a hundred acres of
land.  Accept it as a souvenir."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, my lord! - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Faith! you will be there in
your own home, and that will be the place of refuge you spoke of
just now."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "For me to be obliged to
your lordship to such an extent!  Really, your grace, I am
ashamed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Not at all, not at all,
monsieur," replied Monk, with an arch smile; "it is I who shall
be obliged to you.  And," pressing the hand of the musketeer, "I
shall go and draw up the deed of gift," - and he left the
room.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan looked at him as
he went out with something of a pensive and even an agitated
air.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "After all," said he, "he is
a brave man.  It is only a sad reflection that it is from fear of
me, and not affection that he acts thus.  Well, I shall endeavor
that affection may follow."  Then, after an instant's deeper
reflection, - "Bah!" said he, "to what purpose?  He is an
Englishman."  And he in turn went out, a little confused after
the combat.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So," said he, "I am a
land-owner!  But how the devil am I to share the cottage with
Planchet?  Unless I give him the land, and I take the
ch&acirc;teau, or the he takes the house and I - nonsense!  M.
Monk will never allow me to share a house he has inhabited, with
a grocer.  He is too proud for that.  Besides, why should I say
anything about it to him?  It was not with the money of the
company I have acquired that property, it was with my mother-wit
alone; it is all mine, then.  So, now I will go and find Athos." 
And he directed his steps towards the dwelling of the Comte de la
F&egrave;re.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style='text-align:center'>How
D'Artagnan regulated the "Assets" of the Company before he

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>"D</span>ecidedly,"
said D'Artagnan to himself, "I have struck a good vein.  That
star which shines once in the life of every man, which shone for
Job and Iris, the most unfortunate of the Jews and the poorest of
the Greeks, is come at last to shine on me.  I will commit no
folly, I will take advantage of it; it comes quite late enough to
find me reasonable."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                He supped that evening, in
very good humor, with his friend Athos; he said nothing to him
about the expected donation, but he could not forbear questioning
his friend, while eating, about country produce, sowing, and
planting.  Athos replied complacently, as he always did.  His
idea was that D'Artagnan wished to become a land-owner, only he
could not help regretting, more than once, the absence of the
lively humor and amusing sallies of the cheerful companion of
former days.  In fact, D'Artagnan was so absorbed, that, with his
knife, he took advantage of the grease left at the bottom of his
plate, to trace ciphers and make additions of surprising
rotundity.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The order, or rather
license, for their embarkation, arrived at Athos's lodgings that
evening.  While this paper was remitted to the comte, another
messenger brought to D'Artagnan a little bundle of parchments,
adorned with all the seals employed in setting off property deeds
in England.  Athos surprised him turning over the leaves of these
different acts which established the transmission of property. 
The prudent Monk - others would say the generous Monk - had
commuted the donation into a sale, and acknowledged the receipt
of the sum of fifteen thousand crowns as the price of the
property ceded.  The messenger was gone.  D'Artagnan still
continued reading, Athos watched him with a smile.  D'Artagnan,
surprising one of those smiles over his shoulder, put the bundle
in its wrapper.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I beg your pardon," said
Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! not at all, my friend,"
replied the lieutenant, "I shall tell you - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, don't tell me anything,
I beg you; orders are things so sacred, that to one's brother,
one's father, the person charged with such orders should never
open his mouth.  Thus I, who speak to you, and love you more
tenderly than brother, father, or all the world - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Except your Raoul?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I shall love Raoul still
better when he shall be a man, and I shall have seen him develop
himself in all the phases of his character and his actions - as I
have seen you, my friend."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You said, then, that you
had an order likewise, and that you would not communicate it to
me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, my dear
D'Artagnan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The Gascon sighed.  "There
was a time," said he, "when you would have placed that order open
upon the table, saying, 'D'Artagnan, read this scrawl to Porthos,
Aramis, and to me.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is true.  Oh! that was
the time of youth, confidence, the generous season when the blood
commands, when it is warmed by feeling!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well! Athos, will you allow
me to tell you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Speak, my friend!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That delightful time, that
generous season, that ruling by warm blood, were all very fine
things, no doubt: but I do not regret them at all.  It is
absolutely like the period of studies.  I have constantly met
with fools who would boast of the days of pensums, ferules, and
crusts of dry bread.  It is singular, but I never loved all that;
for my part, however active and sober I might be (you know if I
was so, Athos), however simple I might appear in my clothes, I
would not the less have preferred the braveries and embroideries
of Porthos to my little perforated cassock, which gave passage to
the wind in winter and the sun in summer.  I should always, my
friend, mistrust him who would pretend to prefer evil to good. 
Now, in times past all went wrong with me, and every month found
a fresh hole in my cassock and in my skin, a gold crown less in
my poor purse; of that execrable time of small beer and see-saw,
I regret absolutely nothing, nothing, nothing save our
friendship; for within me I have a heart, and it is a miracle
that heart has not been dried up by the wind of poverty which
passed through all the holes of my cloak, or pierced by the
swords of all shapes which passed through the holes in my poor
flesh."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do not regret our
friendship," said Athos, "that will only die with ourselves. 
Friendship is composed, above all things, of memories and habits,
and if you have just now made a little satire upon mine, because
I hesitate to tell you the nature of my mission into France -
"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who!  I? - Oh! heavens! if
you knew, my dear friend, how indifferent all the missions of the
world will henceforth become to me!"  And he laid his hand upon
the parchment in his vest pocket.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos rose from the table
and called the host in order to pay the reckoning.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Since I have known you, my
friend," said D'Artagnan, "I have never discharged the
reckoning.  Porthos often did, Aramis sometimes, and you, you
almost always drew out your purse with the dessert.  I am now
rich, and should like to try if it is heroic to pay."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do so," said Athos,
returning his purse to his pocket.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The two friends then
directed their steps towards the port, not, however, without
D'Artagnan's frequently turning round to watch the transportation
of his dear crowns.  Night had just spread her thick veil over
the yellow waters of the Thames; they heard those noises of casks
and pulleys, the preliminaries of preparing to sail which had so
many times made the hearts of the musketeers beat when the
dangers of the sea were the least of those they were going to
face.  This time they were to embark on board a large vessel
which awaited them at Gravesend, and Charles II., always delicate
in small affairs, had sent one of his yachts, with twelve men of
his Scots guard, to do honor to the ambassador he was sending to
France.  At midnight the yacht had deposited its passengers on
board the vessel, and at eight o'clock in the morning, the vessel
landed the ambassador and his friend on the wharf at Boulogne. 
Whilst the comte, with Grimaud, was busy procuring horses to go
straight to Paris, D'Artagnan hastened to the hostelry where,
according to his orders, his little army was to wait for him. 
These gentlemen were at breakfast upon oysters, fish, and spiced
brandy, when D'Artagnan appeared.  They were all very gay, but
not one of them had yet exceeded the bounds of reason.  A hurrah
of joy welcomed the general.  "Here I am," said D'Artagnan, "the
campaign is ended.  I am come to bring each his supplement of
pay, as agreed upon."  Their eyes sparkled.  "I will lay a wager
there are not, at this moment, a hundred crowns remaining in the
purse of the richest among you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is true!" cried they
in chorus.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Gentlemen," said
D'Artagnan, "then, this is the last order.  The treaty of
commerce has been concluded, thanks to our <i>coup-de-main</i>
which made us masters of the most skillful financier of England,
for now I am at liberty to confess to you that the man we had to
carry off was the treasurer of General Monk."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This word treasurer produced
a certain effect on his army.  D'Artagnan observed that the eyes
of Menneville alone did not evince perfect faith.  "This
treasurer," he continued, "I conveyed to a neutral territory,
Holland; I forced him to sign the treaty; I have even reconducted
him to Newcastle, and he was obliged to be satisfied with our
proceedings towards him - the deal coffer being always carried
without jolting, and being lined softly, I asked a gratification
for you.  Here it is."  He threw a respectable-looking purse upon
the cloth; and all involuntarily stretched out their hands.  "One
moment, my lambs," said D'Artagnan; "if there are profits, there
are also charges."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! oh!" murmured they.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=
'text-indent:.5in;punctuation-wrap:hanging'>"We are about to find
ourselves, my friends, in a position that would not be tenable
for people without brains.  I speak plainly; we are between the
gallows and the Bastile."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='punctuation-wrap:hanging'>
                "Oh! oh!" said the chorus.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is easily understood. 
It was necessary to explain to General Monk the disappearance of
his treasurer.  I waited, for that purpose, till the unhoped-for
moment of the restoration of King Charles II., who is one of my
friends."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This army exchanged a glance
of satisfaction in reply to the sufficiently proud look of
D'Artagnan.  "The king being restored, I restored to Monk his man
of business, a little plucked, it is true, but, in short, I
restored him.  Now, General Monk, when he pardoned me, for he has
pardoned me, could not help repeating these words to me, which I
charge every one of you to engrave deeply there, between the
eyes, under the vault of the cranium: - 'Monsieur, the joke has
been a good one, but I don't naturally like jokes; if ever a word
of what you have done' (you understand me, Menneville) 'escapes
from your lips, or the lips of your companions, I have, in my
government of Scotland and Ireland, seven hundred and forty-one
wooden gibbets, of strong oak, clamped with iron, and freshly
greased every week.  I will make a present of one of these
gibbets to each of you, and observe well, M. d'Artagnan,' added
he (observe it also, M. Menneville), 'I shall still have seven
hundred and thirty left for my private pleasure.  And still
further &ndash; '"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! ah!" said the
auxiliaries, "is there still more?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A mere trifle.  'Monsieur
d'Artagnan, I send to the king of France the treaty in question,
with a request that he will cast into the Bastile provisionally,
and then send to me, all who have taken part in this expedition;
and that is a prayer with which the king will certainly
comply.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                A cry of terror broke from
all corners of the table.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "There! there! there!" said
D'Artagnan, "this brave M. Monk has forgotten one thing, and that
is he does not know the name of any one of you; I alone know you,
and it is not I, you well may believe, who will betray you.  Why
should I?  As for you - I cannot suppose you will be silly enough
to denounce yourselves, for then the king, to spare himself the
expense of feeding and lodging you, will send you off to
Scotland, where the seven hundred and forty-one gibbets are to be
found.  That is all, messieurs; I have not another word to add to
what I have had the honor to tell you.  I am sure you have
understood me perfectly well, have you not, M. Menneville?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Perfectly," replied the
latter.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Now the crowns!" said
D'Artagnan.  "Shut the doors," he cried, and opened the bag upon
the table, from which rolled several fine gold crowns.  Every one
made a movement towards the floor.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Gently!" cried D'Artagnan. 
"Let no one stoop, and then I shall not be out in my reckoning." 
He found it all right, gave fifty of those splendid crowns to
each man, and received as many benedictions as he bestowed
pieces.  "Now," said he, "if it were possible for you to reform a
little, if you could become good and honest citizens - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is rather difficult,"
said one of the troop.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What then, captain?" said
another.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Because I might be able to
find you again, and, who knows what other good fortune?"  He made
a sign to Menneville, who listened to all he said with a composed
air.  "Menneville," said he, "come with me.  Adieu, my brave
fellows!  I need not warn you to be discreet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Menneville followed him,
whilst the salutations of the auxiliaries were mingled with the
sweet sound of the money clinking in their pockets.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Menneville," said
D'Artagnan, when they were once in the street, "you were not my
dupe; beware of being so.  You did not appear to have any fear of
the gibbets of Monk, or the Bastile of his majesty, King Louis
XIV., but you will do me the favor of being afraid of me.  Then
listen; at the smallest word that shall escape you, I will kill
you as I would a fowl.  I have absolution from our holy father,
the pope, in my pocket."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I assure you I know
absolutely nothing, my dear M. d'Artagnan, and that your words
have all been to me so many articles of faith."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I was quite sure you were
an intelligent fellow," said the musketeer; "I have tried you for
a length of time.  These fifty crowns which I give you above the
rest will prove the esteem <i> </i> I have for you.  Take
them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thanks, Monsieur
d'Artagnan," said Menneville.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "With that sum you can
really become an honest man," replied D'Artagnan, in the most
serious tone possible.  "It would be disgraceful for a mind like
yours, and a name you no longer dare to bear, to sink forever
under the rust of an evil life.  Become a gallant man,
Menneville, and live for a year upon those hundred gold crowns:
it is a good provision; twice the pay of a high officer.  In a
year come to me, and, <i>Mordioux! </i> I will make something of
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Menneville swore, as his
comrades had sworn, that he would be as silent as the grave.  And
yet some one must have spoken; and as, certainly, it was not one
of the nine companions, and quite as certainly, it was not
Menneville, it must have been D'Artagnan, who, in his quality of
a Gascon, had his tongue very near to his lips.  For, in short,
if it were not he, who could it be?  And how can it be explained
that the secret of the deal coffer pierced with holes should come
to our knowledge, and in so complete a fashion that we have, as
has been seen, related the history of it in all its most minute
details; details which, besides, throw a light as new as
unexpected upon all that portion of the history of England which
has been left, up to the present day, completely in darkness by
the historian of our neighbors?</p>

once settled, and his recommendations made, D'Artagnan thought of
nothing but returning to Paris as soon as possible.  Athos, on
his part, was anxious to reach home and to rest a little. 
However whole the character and the man may remain after the
fatigues of a voyage, the traveler perceives with pleasure, at
the close of the day - even though the day has been a fine one -
that night is approaching, and will bring a little sleep with
it.  So, from Boulogne to Paris, jogging on, side by side, the
two friends, in some degree absorbed each in his individual
thoughts, conversed of nothing sufficiently interesting for us to
repeat to our readers.  Each of them given up to his personal
reflections, and constructing his future after his own fashion,
was, above all, anxious to abridge the distance by speed.  Athos
and D'Artagnan arrived at the gates of Paris on the evening of
the fourth day after leaving Boulogne.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Where are you going, my
friend?" asked Athos.  "I shall direct my course straight to my
hotel."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And I straight to my
partner's."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To Planchet's?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes; at the Pilon
d'Or."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, but shall we not meet
again?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "If you remain in Paris,
yes; for I shall stay here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No: after having embraced
Raoul, with whom I have appointed a meeting at my hotel, I shall
set out immediately for La F&egrave;re."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, adieu, then, dear and
true friend."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Au revoir!</i>  I should
rather say, for why can you not come and live with me at Blois? 
You are free, you are rich, I shall purchase for you, if you
like, a handsome estate in the vicinity of Cheverny or of
Bracieux.  On the one side you will have the finest woods in the
world, which join those of Chambord; on the other, admirable
marshes.  You who love sporting, and who, whether you admit it or
not, are a poet, my dear friend, you will find pheasants, rail
and teal, without counting sunsets and excursions on the water,
to make you fancy yourself Nimrod and Apollo themselves.  While
awaiting the purchase, you can live at La F&egrave;re, and we
shall go together to fly our hawks among the vines, as Louis
XIII. used to do.  That is a quiet amusement for old fellows like
us."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan took the hands of
Athos in his own.  "Dear count," said he, "I shall say neither
'Yes' nor 'No.'  Let me pass in Paris the time necessary for the
regulation of my affairs, and accustom myself, by degrees, to the
heavy and glittering idea which is beating in my brain and
dazzles me.  I am rich, you see, and from this moment until the
time when I shall have acquired the habit of being rich, I know
myself, and I shall be an insupportable animal.  Now, I am not
enough of a fool to wish to appear to have lost my wits before a
friend like you, Athos.  The cloak is handsome, the cloak is
richly gilded, but it is new, and does not seem to fit me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos smiled.  "So be it,"
said he.  "But <i>&agrave; propos</i> of this cloak, dear
D'Artagnan, will you allow me to offer you a little advice?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, willingly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You will not be angry?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Proceed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "When wealth comes to a man
late in life or all at once, that man, in order not to change,
must most likely become a miser - that is to say, not spend much
more money than he had done before; or else become a prodigal,
and contract so many debts as to become poor again."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! but what you say looks
very much like a sophism, my dear philosophic friend."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I do not think so.  Will
you become a miser?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, <i>pardieu!</i>  I was
one already, having nothing.  Let us change."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then be prodigal."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Still less,
<i>Mordioux!</i>  Debts terrify me.  Creditors appear to me, by
anticipation, like those devils who turn the damned upon the
gridirons, and as patience is not my dominant virtue, I am always
tempted to thrash those devils."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are the wisest man I
know, and stand in no need of advice from any one.  Great fools
must they be who think they have anything to teach you.  But are
we not at the Rue Saint Honor&eacute;?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, dear Athos."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Look yonder, on the left,
that small, long white house is the hotel where I lodge.  You may
observe that it has but two stories; I occupy the first; the
other is let to an officer whose duties oblige him to be absent
eight or nine months in the year, - so I am in that house as in
my own home, without the expense."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! how well you manage,
Athos!  What order and what liberality!  They are what I wish to
unite!  But, of what use trying! that comes from birth, and
cannot be acquired."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are a flatterer!  Well!
adieu, dear friend.  <i>A propos</i>, remember me to Master
Planchet; he always was a bright fellow."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And a man of heart, too,
Athos.  Adieu."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                And the separated.  During
all this conversation, D'Artagnan had not for a moment lost sight
of a certain pack-horse, in whose panniers, under some hay, were
spread the <i>sacoches</i> (messenger's bags) with the
portmanteau.  Nine o'clock was striking at Saint-Merri. 
Planchet's helps were shutting up his shop.  D'Artagnan stopped
the postilion who rode the pack-horse, at the corner of the Rue
des Lombards, under a pent-house, and calling one of Planchet's
boys, he desired him not only to take care of the two horses, but
to watch the postilion; after which he entered the shop of the
grocer, who had just finished supper, and who, in his little
private room, was, with a degree of anxiety, consulting the
calendar, on which, every evening, he scratched out the day that
was past.  At the moment when Planchet, according to his daily
custom, with the back of his pen, erased another day, D'Artagnan
kicked the door with his foot, and the blow made his steel spur
jingle.  "Oh! good Lord!" cried Planchet.  The worthy grocer
could say no more; he had just perceived his partner.  D'Artagnan
entered with a bent back and a dull eye: the Gascon had an idea
with regard to Planchet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good God!" thought the
grocer, looking earnestly at the traveler, "he looks sad!"  The
musketeer sat down.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My dear Monsieur
d'Artagnan!" said Planchet, with a horrible palpitation of the
heart.  "Here you are! and your health?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Tolerably good, Planchet,
tolerably good!" said D'Artagnan, with a profound sigh.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You have not been wounded,
I hope?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Phew!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, I see," continued
Planchet, more and more alarmed, "the expedition has been a
trying one?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes," said D'Artagnan.  A
shudder ran down Planchet's back.  "I should like to have
something to drink," said the musketeer, raising his head
piteously.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Planchet ran to the
cupboard, and poured out to D'Artagnan some wine in a large
glass.  D'Artagnan examined the bottle.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What wine is that?" asked
he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Alas! that which you
prefer, monsieur," said Planchet; "that good old Anjou wine,
which was one day nearly costing us all so dear."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah!" replied D'Artagnan,
with a melancholy smile, "Ah! my poor Planchet, ought I still to
drink good wine?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Come! my dear master," said
Planchet, making a super-human effort, whilst all his contracted
muscles, his pallor and his trembling betrayed the most acute
anguish.  "Come!  I have been a soldier and consequently have
some courage; do not make me linger, dear Monsieur d'Artagnan;
our money is lost, is it not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Before he answered,
D'Artagnan took his time, and that appeared an age to the poor
grocer.  Nevertheless he did nothing but turn about on his
chair.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And if that were the case,"
said he, slowly, moving his head up and down, "if that were the
case, what would you say, my dear friend?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Planchet, from being pale,
turned yellow.  It might have been thought he was going to
swallow his tongue, so full became his throat, so red were his
eyes!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Twenty thousand livres!"
murmured he.  "Twenty thousand livres, and yet - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan, with his neck
elongated, his legs stretched out, and his hands hanging
listlessly, looked like a statue of discouragement.  Planchet
drew up a sigh from the deepest cavities of his breast.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well," said he, "I see how
it is.  Let us be men!  It is all over, is it not?  The principal
thing is, monsieur, that your life is safe."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Doubtless! doubtless! -
life is something - but I am ruined!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Cordieu!</i> monsieur!"
said Planchet, "If it is so, we must not despair for that; you
shall become a grocer with me; I shall take you for my partner,
we will share the profits, and if there should be no more
profits, well, why then we shall share the almonds, raisins and
prunes, and we will nibble together the last quarter of Dutch
cheese."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan could hold out no
longer.  "<i>Mordioux!</i>" cried he, with great emotion, "thou
art a brave fellow, on my honor, Planchet.  You have not been
playing a part, have you?  You have not seen the pack-horse with
the bags under the shed yonder?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What horse?  What bags?"
said Planchet, whose trembling heart began to suggest that
D'Artagnan was mad.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, the English bags,
<i>Mordioux!</i>" said D'Artagnan, all radiant, quite
transfigured.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! good God!" articulated
Planchet, drawing back before the dazzling fire of his looks.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Imbecile!" cried
D'Artagnan, "you think me mad!  <i>Mordioux!</i>  On the
contrary, never was my head more clear, or my heart more joyous. 
To the bags, Planchet, to the bags!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But to what bags, good
heavens!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan pushed Planchet
towards the window.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Under that shed yonder,
don't you see a horse?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Don't you see how his back
is laden?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, yes!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Don't you see your lad
talking with the postilion?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, yes, yes!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, you know the name of
that lad, because he is your own.  Call him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Abdon!  Abdon!" vociferated
Planchet, from the window.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bring the horse!" shouted
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bring the horse!" screamed
Planchet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Now give ten livres to the
postilion," said D'Artagnan, in the tone he would have employed
in commanding a maneuver; "two lads to bring up the first two
bags, two to bring up the two last, - and move, <i>Mordioux!</i>
be lively!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Planchet rushed down the
stairs, as if the devil had been at his heels.  A moment later
the lads ascended the stairs, bending beneath their burden. 
D'Artagnan sent them off to their garrets, carefully closed the
door, and addressing Planchet, who, in his turn, looked a little
wild, -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Now, we are by ourselves,"
said he; and he spread upon the floor a large cover, and emptied
the first bag into it.  Planchet did the same with the second;
then D'Artagnan, all in a tremble, let out the precious bowels of
the third with a knife.  When Planchet heard the provoking sound
of the silver and gold - when he saw bubbling out of the bags the
shining crowns, which glittered like fish from the sweep-net -
when he felt himself plunging his hands up to the elbows in that
still rising tide of yellow and white coins, a giddiness seized
him, and like a man struck by lightning, he sank heavily down
upon the enormous heap, which his weight caused to roll away in
all directions.  Planchet, suffocated with joy, had lost his
senses.  D'Artagnan threw a glass of white wine in his face,
which incontinently recalled him to life.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! good heavens! good
heavens! good heavens!" said Planchet, wiping his mustache and
beard.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                At that time, as they do
now, grocers wore the cavalier mustache and the lansquenet beard,
only the money baths, already rare in those days, have become
almost unknown now.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Mordioux!</i>" said
D'Artagnan, "there are a hundred thousand livres for you,
partner.  Draw your share, if you please, and I will draw
mine."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! the lovely sum! 
Monsieur d'Artagnan, the lovely sum!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I confess that half an hour
ago I regretted that I had to give you so much; but now I no
longer regret it; thou art a brave grocer, Planchet.  There, let
us close our accounts, for, as they say, short reckonings make
long friends."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! rather, in the first
place, tell me the whole history," said Planchet; "that must be
better than the money."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Ma foi!</i>" said
D'Artagnan, stroking his mustache, "I can't say no; and if ever
the historian turns to me for information, he will be able to say
he has not dipped his bucket into a dry spring.  Listen, then,
Planchet, I will tell you all about it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And I shall build piles of
crowns," said Planchet.  "Begin, my dear master."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, this is it," said
D'Artagnan, drawing his breath.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And that is it," said
Planchet, picking up his first handful of crowns.</p>

Mazarin's Gaming Party.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>I</span>n a large
chamber of the Palais Royal, hung with a dark colored velvet,
which threw into strong relief the gilded frames of a great
number of magnificent pictures, on the evening of the arrival of
the two Frenchmen, the whole court was assembled before the
alcove of M. le Cardinal de Mazarin, who gave a card party to the
king and queen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                A small screen separated
three prepared tables.  At one of these tables the king and the
two queens were seated.  Louis XIV., placed opposite to the young
queen, his wife, smiled upon her with an expression of real
happiness.  Anne of Austria held the cards against the cardinal,
and her daughter-in-law assisted her in the game, when she was
not engaged in smiling at her husband.  As for the cardinal, who
was lying on his bed with a weary and careworn face, his cards
were held by the Comtesse de Soissons, and he watched them with
an incessant look of interest and cupidity.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The cardinal's face had been
painted by Bernouin; but the rouge, which glowed only on his
cheeks, threw into stronger contrast the sickly pallor of his
countenance and the shining yellow of his brow.  His eyes alone
acquired a more brilliant luster from this auxiliary, and upon
those sick man's eyes were, from time to time, turned the uneasy
looks of the king, the queen, and the courtiers.  The fact is,
that the two eyes of the Signor Mazarin were the stars more or
less brilliant in which the France of the seventeenth century
read its destiny every evening and every morning.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monseigneur neither won nor
lost; he was, therefore, neither gay nor sad.  It was a
stagnation in which, full of pity for him, Anne of Austria would
not have willingly left him; but in order to attract the
attention of the sick man by some brilliant stroke, she must have
either won or lost.  To win would have been dangerous, because
Mazarin would have changed his indifference into an ugly grimace;
to lose would likewise have been dangerous, because she must have
cheated, and the infanta, who watched her game, would, doubtless,
have exclaimed against her partiality for Mazarin.  Profiting by
this calm, the courtiers were chatting.  When not in a bad humor,
M. de Mazarin was a very <i>d&eacute;bonnaire</i> prince, and he,
who prevented nobody from singing, provided they paid, was not
tyrant enough to prevent people from talking, provided they made
up their minds to lose.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                They were therefore
chatting.  At the first table, the king's younger brother,
Philip, Duc d'Anjou, was admiring his handsome face in the glass
of a box.  His favorite, the Chevalier de Lorraine, leaning over
the back of the prince's chair, was listening, with secret envy,
to the Comte de Guiche, another of Philip's favorites, who was
relating in choice terms the various vicissitudes of fortune of
the royal adventurer Charles II.  He told, as so many fabulous
events, all the history of his perigrinations in Scotland, and
his terrors when the enemy's party was so closely on his track;
of nights spent in trees, and days spent in hunger and combats. 
By degrees, the fate of the unfortunate king interested his
auditors so greatly, that the play languished even at the royal
table, and the young king, with a pensive look and downcast eye,
followed, without appearing to give any attention to it, the
smallest details of this Odyssey, very picturesquely related by
the Comte de Guiche.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The Comtesse de Soissons
interrupted the narrator: "Confess, count, you are
inventing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Madame, I am repeating like
a parrot all the stories related to me by different Englishmen. 
To my shame I am compelled to say, I am as exact as a copy."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Charles II. would have died
before he could have endured all that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis XIV. raised his
intelligent and proud head.  "Madame," said he, in a grave tone,
still partaking something of the timid child, "monsieur le
cardinal will tell you that during my minority the affairs of
France were in jeopardy, - and that if I had been older, and
obliged to take sword in hand, it would sometimes have been for
the purpose of procuring the evening meal."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thanks to God," said the
cardinal, who spoke for the first time, "your majesty
exaggerates, and your supper has always been ready with that of
your servants."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king colored.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!" cried Philip,
inconsiderately, from his place, and without ceasing to admire
himself, - "I recollect once, at Melun, the supper was laid for
nobody, and that the king ate two-thirds of a slice of bread, and
abandoned to me the other third."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The whole assembly, seeing
Mazarin smile, began to laugh.  Courtiers flatter kings with the
remembrance of past distresses, as with the hopes of future good
fortune.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is not to be denied that
the crown of France has always remained firm upon the heads of
its kings," Anne of Austria hastened to say, "and that it has
fallen off of that of the king of England; and when by chance
that crown oscillated a little, - for there are throne-quakes as
well as earthquakes, - every time, I say, that rebellion
threatened it, a good victory restored tranquility."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "With a few gems added to
the crown," said Mazarin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The Comte de Guiche was
silent: the king composed his countenance, and Mazarin exchanged
looks with Anne of Austria, as if to thank her for her
intervention.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is of no consequence,"
said Philip, smoothing his hair; "my cousin Charles is not
handsome, but he is very brave, and fought like a landsknecht;
and if he continues to fight thus, no doubt he will finish by
gaining a battle, like Rocroi - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He has no soldiers,"
interrupted the Chevalier de Lorraine.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The king of Holland, his
ally, will give him some.  I would willingly have given him some
if I had been king of France."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis XIV. blushed
excessively.  Mazarin affected to be more attentive to his game
than ever.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "By this time," resumed the
Comte de Guiche, "the fortune of this unhappy prince is decided. 
If he has been deceived by Monk, he is ruined.  Imprisonment,
perhaps death, will finish what exiles, battles, and privations
have commenced."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Mazarin's brow became
clouded.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is certain," said Louis
XIV., "that his majesty Charles II., has quitted the Hague?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Quite certain, your
majesty," replied the young man; "my father has received a letter
containing all the details; it is even known that the king has
landed at Dover; some fishermen saw him entering the port; the
rest is still a mystery."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I should like to know the
rest," said Philip, impetuously.  "You know, - you, my
brother."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis XIV. colored again. 
That was the third time within an hour.  "Ask my lord cardinal,"
replied he, in a tone which made Mazarin, Anne of Austria, and
everybody else open their eyes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That means, my son," said
Anne of Austria, laughing, "that the king does not like affairs
of state to be talked of out of the council."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Philip received the
reprimand with good grace, and bowed, first smiling at his
brother, and then at his mother.  But Mazarin saw from the corner
of his eye that a group was about to be formed in the corner of
the room, and that the Duc d'Anjou, with the Comte de Guiche, and
the Chevalier de Lorraine, prevented from talking aloud, might
say, in a whisper, what it was not convenient should be said.  He
was beginning, then, to dart at them glances full of mistrust and
uneasiness, inviting Anne of Austria to throw perturbation in the
midst of the unlawful assembly, when, suddenly, Bernouin,
entering from behind the tapestry of the bedroom, whispered in
the ear of Mazarin, "Monseigneur, an envoy from his majesty, the
king of England."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Mazarin could not help
exhibiting a slight emotion, which was perceived by the king.  To
avoid being indiscreet, rather than to appear useless, Louis XIV.
rose immediately, and approaching his eminence, wished him
good-night.  All the assembly had risen with a great noise of
rolling of chairs and tables being pushed away.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Let everybody depart by
degrees," said Mazarin in a whisper to Louis XIV., "and be so
good as to excuse me a few minutes.  I am going to dispatch an
affair about which I wish to converse with your majesty this very
evening."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And the queens?" asked
Louis XIV.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And M. le Duc d'Anjou,"
said his eminence.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                At the same time he turned
round in his <i>ruelle</i>, the curtains of which, in falling,
concealed the bed.  The cardinal, nevertheless, did not lose
sight of the conspirators.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "M. le Comte de Guiche,"
said he, in a fretful voice, whilst putting on, behind the
curtain, his dressing-gown, with the assistance of Bernouin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am here, my lord," said
the young man, as he approached.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Take my cards, you are
lucky.  Win a little money for me of these gentlemen."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The young man sat down at
the table from which the king withdrew to talk with the two
queens.  A serious game was commenced between the comte and
several rich courtiers.  In the meantime Philip was discussing
the questions of dress with the Chevalier de Lorraine, and they
had ceased to hear the rustling of the cardinal's silk robe from
behind the curtain.  His eminence had followed Bernouin into the
closet adjoining the bedroom.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>T</span>he cardinal,
on passing into his cabinet, found the Comte de la F&egrave;re,
who was waiting for him, engaged in admiring a very fine Raphael
placed over a sideboard covered with a plate.  His eminence came
in softly, lightly, and as silently as a shadow, and surprised
the countenance of the comte, as he was accustomed to do,
pretending to divine by the simple expression of the face of his
interlocutor what would be the result of the conversation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                But this time Mazarin was
foiled in his expectation: he read nothing upon the face of
Athos, not even the respect he was accustomed to see on all
faces.  Athos was dressed in black, with a simple lacing of
silver.  He wore the Holy Ghost, the Garter, and the Golden
Fleece, three orders of such importance, that a king alone, or
else a player, could wear them at once.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Mazarin rummaged a long time
in his somewhat troubled memory to recall the name he ought to
give to this icy figure, but he did not succeed.  "I am told,"
said he, at length, "you have a message from England for me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                And he sat down, dismissing
Bernouin, who, in his quality of secretary, was getting his pen
ready.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "On the part of his majesty,
the king of England, yes, your eminence."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You speak very good French
for an Englishman, monsieur," said Mazarin, graciously, looking
through his fingers at the Holy Ghost, Garter, and Golden Fleece,
but more particularly at the face of the messenger.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am not an Englishman, but
a Frenchman, monsieur le cardinal," replied Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is remarkable that the
king of England should choose a Frenchman for his ambassador; it
is an excellent augury.  Your name, monsieur, if you please."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Comte de la F&egrave;re,"
replied Athos, bowing more slightly than the ceremonial and pride
of the all-powerful minister required.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Mazarin bent his shoulders,
as if to say: -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I do not know that
name."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos did not alter his
carriage.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you come, monsieur,"
continued Mazarin, "to tell me - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I come on the part of his
majesty the king of Great Britain to announce to the king of
France" - Mazarin frowned - "to announce to the king of France,"
continued Athos, imperturbably, "the happy restoration of his
majesty Charles II. to the throne of his ancestors."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This shade did not escape
his cunning eminence.  Mazarin was too much accustomed to
mankind, not to see in the cold and almost haughty politeness of
Athos, an index of hostility, which was not of the temperature of
that hot-house called a court.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You have powers, I
suppose?" asked Mazarin, in a short, querulous tone.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monseigneur."  And the
word "monseigneur" came so painfully from the lips of Athos that
it might be said it skinned them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos took from an
embroidered velvet bag which he carried under his doublet a
dispatch.  The cardinal held out his hand for it.  "Your pardon,
monseigneur," said Athos.  "My dispatch is for the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Since you are a Frenchman,
monsieur, you ought to know the position of a prime minister at
the court of France."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "There was a time," replied
Athos, "when I occupied myself with the importance of prime
ministers; but I have formed, long ago, a resolution to treat no
longer with any but the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then, monsieur," said
Mazarin, who began to be irritated, "you will neither see the
minister nor the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Mazarin rose.  Athos
replaced his dispatch in its bag, bowed gravely, and made several
steps towards the door.  This coolness exasperated Mazarin. 
"What strange diplomatic proceedings are these!" cried he.  "Have
we returned to the times when Cromwell sent us bullies in the
guise of <i>charg&eacute;s d'affaires?</i>  You want nothing,
monsieur, but the steel cap on your head, and a Bible at your
girdle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," said Athos,
dryly, "I have never had, as you have, the advantage of treating
with Cromwell; and I have only seen his <i>charg&eacute;s
d'affaires</i> sword in hand; I am therefore ignorant of how he
treated with prime ministers.  As for the king of England,
Charles II., I know that when he writes to his majesty King Louis
XIV., he does not write to his eminence the Cardinal Mazarin.  I
see no diplomacy in that distinction."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah!" cried Mazarin, raising
his attenuated hand, and striking his head, "I remember now!" 
Athos looked at him in astonishment.  "Yes, that is it!" said the
cardinal, continuing to look at his interlocutor; "yes, that is
certainly it.  I know you now, monsieur.  Ah! <i>diavolo!</i>  I
am no longer astonished."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In fact, I was astonished
that, with your eminence's excellent memory," replied Athos,
smiling, "you had not recognized me before."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Always refractory and
grumbling - monsieur - monsieur - What do they call you?  Stop -
a name of a river - Potamos; no - the name of an island - Naxos;
no, <i>per Giove!</i> - the name of a mountain - Athos! now I
have it.  Delighted to see you again, and to be no longer at
Rueil, where you and your damned companions made me pay ransom. 
Fronde! still Fronde! accursed Fronde!  Oh, what grudges!  Why,
monsieur, have your antipathies survived mine?  If any one has
cause to complain, I think it could not be you, who got out of
the affair not only in a sound skin, but with the <i>cordon</i>
of the Holy Ghost around your neck."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord cardinal," replied
Athos, "permit me not to enter into considerations of that kind. 
I have a mission to fulfill.  Will you facilitate the means of my
fulfilling that mission, or will you not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am astonished," said
Mazarin, - quite delighted at having recovered his memory, and
bristling with malice, - "I am astonished, Monsieur - Athos -
that a <i>Frondeur</i> like you should have accepted a mission
for the perfidious Mazarin, as used to be said in the good old
times - "  And Mazarin began to laugh, in spite of a painful
cough, which cut short his sentences, converting them into
sobs.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have only accepted the
mission near the king of France, monsieur le cardinal," retorted
the comte, though with less asperity, for he thought he had
sufficiently the advantage to show himself moderate.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And yet, <i>Monsieur le
Frondeur</i>," said Mazarin, gayly, "the affair which you have
taken in charge must, from the king - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "With which I have been
given in charge, monseigneur.  I do not run after affairs."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Be it so.  I say that this
negotiation must pass through my hands.  Let us lose no precious
time, then.  Tell me the conditions."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have had the honor of
assuring your eminence that only the letter of his majesty King
Charles II. contains the revelation of his wishes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Pooh! you are ridiculous
with your obstinacy, Monsieur Athos.  It is plain you have kept
company with the Puritans yonder.  As to your secret, I know it
better than you do; and you have done wrongly, perhaps, in not
having shown some respect for a very old and suffering man, who
has labored much during his life, and kept the field for his
ideas as bravely as you have for yours.  You will not communicate
your letter to me?  You will say nothing to me?  Very well!  Come
with me into my chamber; you shall speak to the king - and before
the king. - Now, then, one last word: who gave you the Fleece?  I
remember you passed for having the Garter; but as to the Fleece,
I do not know - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Recently, my lord, Spain,
on the occasion of the marriage of his majesty Louis XIV., sent
King Charles II. a <i>brevet</i> of the Fleece in blank; Charles
II. immediately transmitted it to me, filling up the blank with
my name."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Mazarin arose, and leaning
on the arm of Bernouin, he returned to his <i>ruelle</i> at the
moment the name of M. le Prince was being announced.  The Prince
de Cond&eacute;, the first prince of the blood, the conqueror of
Rocroi, Lens, and Nordlingen, was, in fact, entering the
apartment of Monseigneur de Mazarin, followed by his gentlemen,
and had already saluted the king, when the prime minister raised
his curtain.  Athos had time to see Raoul pressing the hand of
the Comte de Guiche, and send him a smile in return for his
respectful bow.  He had time, likewise, to see the radiant
countenance of the cardinal, when he perceived before him, upon
the table, an enormous heap of gold, which the Comte de Guiche
had won in a run of luck, after his eminence had confided his
cards to him.  So forgetting ambassador, embassy and prince, his
first thought was of the gold.  "What!" cried the old man - "all
that - won?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Some fifty thousand crowns;
yes, monseigneur," replied the Comte de Guiche, rising.  "Must I
give up my place to your eminence, or shall I continue?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Give up! give up! you are
mad.  You would lose all you have won.  <i>Peste!</i>"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord!" said the Prince
de Cond&eacute;, bowing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good-evening, monsieur le
prince," said the minister, in a careless tone; "it is very kind
of you to visit an old sick friend."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A friend!" murmured the
Comte de la F&egrave;re, at witnessing with stupor this monstrous
alliance of words; - "friends! when the parties are Cond&eacute;
and Mazarin!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Mazarin seemed to divine the
thoughts of the <i>Frondeur</i>, for he smiled upon him with
triumph, and immediately, - "Sire," said he to the king, "I have
the honor of presenting to your majesty, Monsieur le Comte de la
F&egrave;re, ambassador from his Britannic majesty.  An affair of
state, gentlemen," added he, waving his hand to all who filled
the chamber, and who, the Prince de Cond&eacute; at their head,
all disappeared at the simple gesture.  Raoul, after a last look
cast at the comte, followed M. de Cond&eacute;.  Philip of Anjou
and the queen appeared to be consulting about departing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A family affair," said
Mazarin, suddenly, detaining them in their seats.  "This
gentleman is the bearer of a letter in which King Charles II.,
completely restored to his throne, demands an alliance between
Monsieur, the brother of the king, and Mademoiselle Henrietta,
grand-daughter of Henry IV.  Will you remit your letter of credit
to the king, monsieur le comte?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos remained for a minute
stupefied.  How could the minister possibly know the contents of
the letter, which had never been out of his keeping for a single
instant?  Nevertheless, always master of himself, he held out the
dispatch to the young king, Louis XIV., who took it with a
blush.  A solemn silence reigned in the cardinal's chamber.  It
was only troubled by the dull sound of the gold, which Mazarin,
with his yellow, dry hand, piled up in a casket, whilst the king
was reading.</p>

maliciousness of the cardinal did not leave much for the
ambassador to say; nevertheless, the word "restoration" had
struck the king, who, addressing the comte, upon whom his eyes
had been fixed since his entrance, - "Monsieur," said he, "will
you have the kindness to give us some details concerning the
affairs of England.  You come from that country, you are a
Frenchman, and the orders which I see glittering upon your person
announce you to be a man of merit as well as a man of
quality."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," said the
cardinal, turning towards the queen-mother, "is an ancient
servant of your majesty's, Monsieur le Comte de la
F&egrave;re."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Anne of Austria was as
oblivious as a queen whose life had been mingled with fine and
stormy days.  She looked at Mazarin, whose evil smile promised
her something disagreeable; then she solicited from Athos, by
another look, an explanation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," continued the
cardinal, "was a Tr&eacute;ville musketeer, in the service of the
late king.  Monsieur is well acquainted with England, whither he
has made several voyages at various periods; he is a subject of
the highest merit."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                These words made allusion to
all the memories which Anne of Austria trembled to evoke. 
England, that was her hatred of Richelieu and her love for
Buckingham; a Tr&eacute;ville musketeer, that was the whole
Odyssey of the triumphs which had made the heart of the young
woman throb, and of the dangers which had been so near
overturning the throne of the young queen.  These words had much
power, for they rendered mute and attentive all the royal
personages, who, with very various sentiments, set about
recomposing at the same time the mysteries which the young had
not seen, and which the old had believed to be forever
effaced.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Speak, monsieur," said
Louis XIV., the first to escape from troubles, suspicions, and
remembrances.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, speak," added Mazarin,
to whom the little malicious thrust directed against Anne of
Austria had restored energy and gayety.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire," said the comte, "a
sort of miracle has changed the whole destiny of Charles II. 
That which men, till that time, had been unable to do, God
resolved to accomplish."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Mazarin coughed while
tossing about in his bed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "King Charles II.,"
continued Athos, "left the Hague neither as a fugitive nor a
conqueror, but as an absolute king, who, after a distant voyage
from his kingdom, returns amidst universal benedictions."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A great miracle, indeed,"
said Mazarin; "for, if the news was true, King Charles II., who
has just returned amidst benedictions, went away amidst
musket-shots."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king remained
impassible.  Philip, younger and more frivolous, could not
repress a smile, which flattered Mazarin as an applause of his
pleasantry.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is plain," said the
king, "there is a miracle; but God, who does so much for kings,
monsieur le comte, nevertheless employs the hand of man to bring
about the triumph of His designs.  To what men does Charles II.
principally owe his re-establishment?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why," interrupted Mazarin,
without any regard for the king's pride - "does not your majesty
know that it is to M. Monk?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I ought to know it,"
replied Louis XIV., resolutely; "and yet I ask my lord
ambassador, the causes of the change in this General Monk?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And your majesty touches
precisely the question," replied Athos; "for without the miracle
of which I have had the honor to speak, General Monk would
probably have remained an implacable enemy of Charles II.  God
willed that a strange, bold, and ingenious idea should enter into
the mind of a certain man, whilst a devoted and courageous idea
took possession of the mind of another man.  The combinations of
these two ideas brought about such a change in the position of M.
Monk, that, from an inveterate enemy, he became a friend to the
deposed king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "These are exactly the
details I asked for," said the king.  "Who and what are the two
men of whom you speak?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Two Frenchmen, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Indeed!  I am glad of
that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And the two ideas," said
Mazarin; - "I am more curious about ideas than about men, for my
part."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes," murmured the
king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The second idea, the
devoted, reasonable idea - the least important, sir - was to go
and dig up a million in gold, buried by King Charles I. at
Newcastle, and to purchase with that gold the adherence of
Monk."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, oh!" said Mazarin,
reanimated by the word million.  "But Newcastle was at the time
occupied by Monk."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur le cardinal,
and that is why I venture to call the idea courageous as well as
devoted.  It was necessary, if Monk refused the offers of the
negotiator, to reinstate King Charles II. in possession of this
million, which was to be torn, as it were, from the loyalty and
not the loyalism of General Monk.  This was effected in spite of
many difficulties: the general proved to be loyal, and allowed
the money to be taken away."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It seems to me," said the
timid, thoughtful king, "that Charles II. could not have known of
this million whilst he was in Paris."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It seems to me," rejoined
the cardinal, maliciously, "that his majesty the king of Great
Britain knew perfectly well of this million, but that he
preferred having two millions to having one."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire," said Athos, firmly,
"the king of England, whilst in France, was so poor that he had
not even money to take the post; so destitute of hope that he
frequently thought of dying.  He was so entirely ignorant of the
existence of the million at Newcastle, that but for a gentleman -
one of your majesty's subjects - the moral depositary of the
million, who revealed the secret to King Charles II., that prince
would still be vegetating in the most cruel forgetfulness."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Let us pass on to the
strange, bold and ingenious idea," interrupted Mazarin, whose
sagacity foresaw a check.  "What was that idea?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This - M. Monk formed the
only obstacle to the re-establishment of the fallen king.  A
Frenchman imagined the idea of suppressing this obstacle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! oh! but he is a
scoundrel, that Frenchman," said Mazarin; "and the idea is not so
ingenious as to prevent its author being tied up by the neck at
the Place de Gr&egrave;ve, by decree of the parliament."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your eminence is mistaken,"
replied Athos, dryly; "I did not say that the Frenchman in
question had resolved to assassinate M. Monk, but only to
suppress him.  The words of the French language have a value
which the gentlemen of France know perfectly.  Besides, this is
an affair of war; and when men serve kings against their enemies
they are not to be condemned by a parliament - God is their
judge.  This French gentleman, then, formed the idea of gaining
possession of the person of Monk, and he executed his plan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king became animated at
the recital of great actions.  The king's younger brother struck
the table with his hand, exclaiming, "Ah! that is fine!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He carried off Monk?" said
the king.  "Why, Monk was in his camp."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And the gentleman was
alone, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is marvelous!" said
Philip.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Marvelous, indeed!" cried
the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good!  There are the two
little lions unchained," murmured the cardinal.  And with an air
of spite, which he did not dissemble: "I am unacquainted with
these details, will you guarantee their authenticity,
monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "All the more easily, my
lord cardinal, from having seen the events."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You have?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king had involuntarily
drawn close to the count, the Duc d'Anjou had turned sharply
round, and pressed Athos on the other side.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What next? monsieur, what
next?" cried they both at the same time.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, M. Monk, being taken
by the Frenchman, was brought to King Charles II., at the Hague. 
The king gave back his freedom to Monk, and the grateful general,
in return, gave Charles II. the throne of Great Britain, for
which so many valiant men had fought in vain."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Philip clapped his hands
with enthusiasm, Louis XIV., more reflective, turned towards the
Comte de la F&egrave;re.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is this true," said he, "in
all its details?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Absolutely true, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That one of my gentlemen
knew the secret of the million, and kept it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The name of that
gentleman?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It was your humble
servant," said Athos, simply, and bowing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                A murmur of admiration made
the heart of Athos swell with pleasure.  He had reason to be
proud, at least.  Mazarin, himself, had raised his arms towards
heaven.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," said the king,
"I shall seek and find means to reward you."  Athos made a
movement.  "Oh, not for your honesty, to be paid for that would
humiliate you; but I owe you a reward for having participated in
the restoration of my brother, King Charles II."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Certainly," said
Mazarin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is the triumph of a good
cause which fills the whole house of France with joy," said Anne
of Austria.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                " I continue," said Louis
XIV.: "Is it also true that a single man penetrated to Monk, in
his camp, and carried him off?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That man had ten
auxiliaries, taken from a very inferior rank."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And nothing more but
them?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Nothing more."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And he is named?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur d'Artagnan,
formerly lieutenant of the musketeers of your majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Anne of Austria colored;
Mazarin became yellow with shame; Louis XIV. was deeply
thoughtful, and a drop of moisture fell from his pale brow. 
"What men!" murmured he.  And, involuntarily, he darted a glance
at the minister which would have terrified him, if Mazarin, at
the moment, had not concealed his head under his pillow.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," said the young
Duc d'Anjou, placing his hand, delicate and white as that of a
woman, upon the arm of Athos, "tell that brave man, I beg you,
that Monsieur, brother of the king, will to-morrow drink his
health before five hundred of the best gentlemen of France." 
And, on finishing those words, the young man, perceiving that his
enthusiasm had deranged one of his ruffles, set to work to put it
to rights with the greatest care imaginable.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Let us resume business,
sire," interrupted Mazarin, who never was enthusiastic, and who
wore no ruffles.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur," replied
Louis XIV.  "Pursue your communication, monsieur le comte," added
he, turning towards Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos immediately began and
offered in due form the hand of the Princess Henrietta Stuart to
the young prince, the king's brother.  The conference lasted an
hour; after which the doors of the chamber were thrown open to
the courtiers, who resumed their places as if nothing had been
kept from them in the occupations of that evening.  Athos then
found himself again with Raoul, and the father and son were able
to clasp each other's hands.</p>

'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>W</span>hilst Mazarin
was endeavoring to recover from the serious alarm he had just
experienced, Athos and Raoul were exchanging a few words in a
corner of the apartment.  "Well, here you are at Paris, then,
Raoul?" said the comte.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur, since the
return of M. le Prince."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I cannot converse freely
with you here, because we are observed; but I shall return home
presently, and shall expect you as soon as your duty
permits."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Raoul bowed, and, at that
moment, M. le Prince came up to them.  The prince had that clear
and keen look which distinguishes birds of prey of the noble
species; his physiognomy itself presented several distinct traits
of this resemblance.  It is known that in the Prince de
Cond&eacute;, the aquiline nose rose out sharply and incisively
from a brow slightly retreating, rather low than high, and
according to the railers of the court, - a pitiless race without
mercy even for genius, - constituted rather an eagle's beak than
a human nose, in the heir of the illustrious princes of the house
of Cond&eacute;.  This penetrating look, this imperious
expression of the whole countenance, generally disturbed those to
whom the prince spoke, more than either majesty or regular beauty
could have done in the conqueror of Rocroi.  Besides this, the
fire mounted so suddenly to his projecting eyes, that with the
prince every sort of animation resembled passion.  Now, on
account of his rank, everybody at the court respected M. le
Prince, and many even, seeing only the man, carried their respect
as far as terror.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis de Cond&eacute; then
advanced towards the Comte de la F&egrave;re and Raoul, with the
marked intention of being saluted by the one, and of speaking
with the other.  No man bowed with more reserved grace than the
Comte de la F&egrave;re.  He disdained to put into a salutation
all the shades which a courtier ordinarily borrows from the same
color - the desire to please.  Athos knew his own personal value,
and bowed to the prince like a man, correcting by something
sympathetic and undefinable that which might have appeared
offensive to the pride of the highest rank in the inflexibility
of his attitude.  The prince was about to speak to Raoul.  Athos
forestalled him.  "If M. le Vicomte de Bragelonne," said he,
"were not one of the humble servants of your royal highness, I
would beg him to pronounce my name before you - <i>mon
prince</i>."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have the honor to address
Monsieur le Comte de la F&egrave;re," said Cond&eacute;,
instantly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My protector," added Raoul,
blushing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "One of the most honorable
men in the kingdom," continued the prince; "one of the first
gentlemen of France, and of whom I have heard so much that I have
frequently desired to number him among my friends."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "An honor of which I should
be unworthy," replied Athos, "but for the respect and admiration
I entertain for your royal highness."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur de Bragelonne,"
said the prince, "is a good officer, and it is plainly seen that
he has been to a good school.  Ah, monsieur le comte, in your
time, generals had soldiers!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is true, my lord, but
nowadays soldiers have generals."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This compliment, which
savored so little of flattery, gave a thrill of joy to the man
whom already Europe considered a hero; and who might be thought
to be satiated with praise.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I regret very much,"
continued the prince, "that you should have retired from the
service, monsieur le comte; for it is more than probable that the
king will soon have a war with Holland or England, and
opportunities for distinguishing himself would not be wanting for
a man who, like you, knows Great Britain as well as you do
France."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I believe I may say,
monseigneur, that I have acted wisely in retiring from the
service," said Athos, smiling.  "France and Great Britain will
henceforward live like two sisters, if I can trust my
presentiments."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your presentiments?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Stop, monseigneur, listen
to what is being said yonder, at the table of my lord the
cardinal."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Where they are
playing?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The cardinal had just raised
himself on one elbow, and made a sign to the king's brother, who
went to him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord," said the
cardinal, "pick up, if you please, all those gold crowns."  And
he pointed to the enormous pile of yellow and glittering pieces
which the Comte de Guiche had raised by degrees before him by a
surprising run of luck at play.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "For me?" cried the Duc
d'Anjou.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Those fifty thousand
crowns; yes, monseigneur, they are yours."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do you give them to
me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have been playing on your
account, monseigneur," replied the cardinal, getting weaker and
weaker, as if this effort of giving money had exhausted all his
physical and moral faculties.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, good heavens!"
exclaimed Philip, wild with joy, "what a fortunate day!"  And he
himself, making a rake of his fingers, drew a part of the sum
into his pockets, which he filled, and still full a third
remained on the table.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Chevalier," said Philip to
his favorite, the Chevalier de Lorraine, "come hither,
chevalier."  The favorite quickly obeyed.  "Pocket the rest,"
said the young prince.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This singular scene was
considered by the persons present only as a touching kind of
family <i>f&ecirc;te</i>.  The cardinal assumed the airs of a
father with the sons of France, and the two princes had grown up
under his wing.  No one then imputed to pride, or even
impertinence, as would be done nowadays, this liberality on the
part of the first minister.  The courtiers were satisfied with
envying the prince. - The king turned away his head.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I never had so much money
before," said the young prince, joyously, as he crossed the
chamber with his favorite to go to his carriage.  "No, never! 
What a weight these crowns are!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But why has monsieur le
cardinal given away all this money at once?" asked M. le Prince
of the Comte de la F&egrave;re.  "He must be very ill, the dear
cardinal!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, my lord, very ill,
without doubt; he looks very ill, as your royal highness may
perceive."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But surely he will die of
it.  A hundred and fifty thousand livres!  Oh, it is incredible! 
But, comte, tell me a reason for it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Patience, monseigneur, I
beg of you.  Here comes M. le Duc d'Anjou, talking with the
Chevalier de Lorraine; I should not be surprised if they spared
us the trouble of being indiscreet.  Listen to them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                In fact the chevalier said
to the prince in a low voice, "My lord, it is not natural for M.
Mazarin to give you so much money.  Take care! you will let some
of the pieces fall, my lord.  What design has the cardinal upon
you to make him so generous?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "As I said," whispered Athos
in the prince's ear; "that, perhaps, is the best reply to your
question."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Tell me, my lord," repeated
the chevalier impatiently, as he was calculating, by weighing
them in his pocket, the quota of the sum which had fallen to his
share by rebound.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My dear chevalier, a
wedding present."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How a wedding present?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eh! yes, I am going to be
married," replied the Duc d'Anjou, without perceiving, at the
moment, he was passing the prince and Athos, who both bowed
respectfully.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The chevalier darted at the
young duke a glance so strange, and so malicious, that the Comte
de la F&egrave;re quite started on beholding it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You! you to be married!"
repeated he; "oh! that's impossible.  You would not commit such a
folly!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bah!  I don't do it myself;
I am made to do it," replied the Duc d'Anjou.  "But come, quick!
let us get rid of our money."  Thereupon he disappeared with his
companion, laughing and talking, whilst all heads were bowed on
his passage.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then," whispered the prince
to Athos, "that is the secret."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It was not I who told you
so, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He is to marry the sister
of Charles II.?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I believe so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The prince reflected for a
moment, and his eye shot forth one of its not infrequent
flashes.  "Humph!" said he slowly, as if speaking to himself;
"our swords are once more to be hung on the wall - for a long
time!" and he sighed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                All that sigh contained of
ambition silently stifled, of extinguished illusions and
disappointed hopes, Athos alone divined, for he alone heard that
sigh.  Immediately after, the prince took leave and the king left
the apartment.  Athos, by a sign made to Bragelonne, renewed the
desire he had expressed at the beginning of the scene.  By
degrees the chamber was deserted, and Mazarin was left alone, a
prey to suffering which he could no longer dissemble. 
"Bernouin!  Bernouin!" cried he in a broken voice.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What does monseigneur
want?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Gu&eacute;naud - let
Gu&eacute;naud be sent for," said his eminence.  "I think I'm
dying."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Bernouin, in great terror,
rushed into the cabinet to give the order, and the
<i>piqueur</i>, who hastened to fetch the physician, passed the
king's carriage in the Rue Saint Honor&eacute;.</p>

order was pressing; Gu&eacute;naud quickly obeyed it.  He found
his patient stretched on his bed, his legs swelled, his face
livid, and his stomach collapsed.  Mazarin had a severe attack of
gout.  He suffered tortures with the impatience of a man who has
not been accustomed to resistances.  On seeing Gu&eacute;naud:
"Ah!" said he; "now I am saved!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Gu&eacute;naud was a very
learned and circumspect man, who stood in no need of the
critiques of Boileau to obtain a reputation.  When facing a
disease, if it were personified in a king, he treated the patient
as a Turk treats a Moor.  He did not, therefore, reply to Mazarin
as the minister expected: "Here is the doctor; good-bye
disease!"  On the contrary, on examining his patient, with a very
serious air:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! oh!" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eh! what!  Gu&eacute;naud! 
How you look at me!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I look as I should on
seeing your complaint, my lord; it is a very dangerous one."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The gout - oh! yes, the
gout."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "With complications, my
lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Mazarin raised himself upon
his elbow, and, questioning by look and gesture: "What do you
mean by that?  Am I worse than I believe myself to be?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord," said
Gu&eacute;naud, seating himself beside the bed; "your eminence
has worked very hard during your life; your eminence has suffered
much."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But I am not old, I fancy. 
The late M. de Richelieu was but seventeen months younger than I
am when he died, and died of a mortal disease.  I am young,
Gu&eacute;naud: remember, I am scarcely fifty-two."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! my lord, you are much
more than that.  How long did the Fronde last?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "For what purpose do you put
such a question to me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "For a medical calculation,
monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, some ten years - off
and on."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very well; be kind enough
to reckon every year of the Fronde as three years - that makes
thirty; now twenty and fifty-two makes seventy-two years.  You
are seventy-two, my lord; and that is a great age."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Whilst saying this, he felt
the pulse of his patient.  This pulse was full of such fatal
indications, that the physician continued, notwithstanding the
interruptions of the patient: "Put down the years of the Fronde
at four each, and you have lived eighty-two years."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Are you speaking seriously,
Gu&eacute;naud?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Alas! yes,
monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You take a roundabout way,
then, to inform me that I am very ill?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Ma foi!</i> yes, my
lord, and with a man of the mind and courage of your eminence, it
ought not to be necessary to do so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The cardinal breathed with
such difficulty that he inspired pity even in a pitiless
physician.  "There are diseases and diseases," resumed Mazarin. 
"From some of them people escape."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is true, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is it not?" cried Mazarin,
almost joyously; "for, in short, what else would be the use of
power, of strength of will?  What would the use of genius be -
your genius, Gu&eacute;naud?  What would be the use of science
and art, if the patient, who disposes of all that, cannot be
saved from peril?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Gu&eacute;naud was about to
open his mouth, but Mazarin continued:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Remember," said he, "I am
the most confiding of your patients; remember I obey you blindly,
and that consequently - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I know all that," said
Gu&eacute;naud.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I shall be cured,
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monseigneur, there is
neither strength of will, nor power, nor genius, nor science that
can resist a disease which God doubtless sends, or which He cast
upon the earth at the creation, with full power to destroy and
kill mankind.  When the disease is mortal, and nothing can -
"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is - my - disease -
mortal?" asked Mazarin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                His eminence sank down for a
moment, like an unfortunate wretch who is crushed by a falling
column.  But the spirit of Mazarin was a strong one, or rather
his mind was a firm one.  "Gu&eacute;naud," said he, recovering
from his first shock, "you will permit me to appeal from your
judgment.  I will call together the most learned men of Europe: I
will consult them.  I will live, in short, by the virtue of I
care not what remedy."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord must not suppose,"
said Gu&eacute;naud, "that I have the presumption to pronounce
alone upon an existence so valuable as yours.  I have already
assembled all the good physicians and practitioners of France and
Europe.  There were twelve of them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And they said - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "They said that your
eminence was suffering from a mortal disease; I have the
consultation signed in my portfolio.  If your eminence will
please to see it, you will find the names of all the incurable
diseases we have met with.  There is first - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, no!" cried Mazarin,
pushing away the paper.  "No, no, Gu&eacute;naud, I yield!  I
yield!"  And a profound silence, during which the cardinal
resumed his senses and recovered his strength, succeeded to the
agitation of this scene.  "There is another thing," murmured
Mazarin; "there are empirics and charlatans.  In my country,
those whom physicians abandon run the chance of a quack, who
kills them ten times but saves them a hundred times."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Has not your eminence
observed, that during the last month I have changed my remedies
ten times?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes.  Well?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, I have spent fifty
thousand crowns in purchasing the secrets of all these fellows:
the list is exhausted, and so is my purse.  You are not cured:
and, but for my art, you would be dead."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That ends it!" murmured the
cardinal; "that ends it."  And he threw a melancholy look upon
the riches which surrounded him.  "And must I quit all that?"
sighed he.  "I am dying, Gu&eacute;naud!  I am dying!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! not yet, my lord," said
the physician.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Mazarin seized his hand. 
"In what time?" asked he, fixing his two large eyes upon the
impassible countenance of the physician.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord, we never tell
that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To ordinary men, perhaps
not; - but to me - to me, whose every minute is worth a
treasure.  Tell me, Gu&eacute;naud, tell me!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, no, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I insist upon it, I tell
you.  Oh! give me a month, and for every one of those thirty days
I will pay you a hundred thousand crowns."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord," replied
Gu&eacute;naud, in a firm voice, "it is God who can give you days
of grace, and not I.  God only allows you a fortnight."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The cardinal breathed a
painful sigh, and sank back down upon his pillow, murmuring,
"Thank you, Gu&eacute;naud, thank you!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The physician was about to
depart; the dying man, raising himself up: "Silence!" said he,
with flaming eyes, "silence!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord, I have known this
secret two months; you see that I have kept it faithfully."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Go, Gu&eacute;naud; I will
take care of your fortunes; go, and tell Brienne to send me a
clerk called M. Colbert.  Go!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>C</span>olbert was
not far off.  During the whole evening he had remained in one of
the corridors, chatting with Bernouin and Brienne, and
commenting, with the ordinary skill of people of court, upon the
news which developed like air-bubbles upon the water, on the
surface of each event.  It is doubtless time to trace, in a few
words, one of the most interesting portraits of the age, and to
trace it with as much truth, perhaps, as contemporary painters
have been able to do.  Colbert was a man in whom the historian
and the moralist have an equal right.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                He was thirteen years older
than Louis XIV., his future master.  Of middle height, rather
lean than otherwise, he had deep-set eyes, a mean appearance, his
hair was coarse, black and thin, which, say the biographers of
his time, made him take early to the skull-cap.  A look of
severity, of harshness even, a sort of stiffness, which, with
inferiors, was pride, with superiors an affectation of superior
virtue; a surly cast of countenance upon all occasions, even when
looking at himself in a glass alone - such is the exterior of his
personage.  As to the moral part of his character, the depth of
his talent for accounts, and his ingenuity in making sterility
itself productive, were much boasted of.  Colbert had formed the
idea of forcing governors of frontier places to feed the
garrisons without pay, with what they drew from contributions. 
Such a valuable quality made Mazarin think of replacing Joubert,
his intendant, who had recently died, by M. Colbert, who had such
skill in nibbling down allowances.  Colbert by degrees crept into
court, notwithstanding his lowly birth, for he was the son of a
man who sold wine as his father had done, but who afterwards sold
cloth, and then silk stuffs.  Colbert, destined for trade, had
been clerk in Lyons to a merchant, whom he had quitted to come to
Paris in the office of a Ch&acirc;tlet procureur named Biterne. 
It was here he learned the art of drawing up an account, and the
much more valuable one of complicating it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This stiffness of manner in
Colbert had been of great service to him; it is so true that
Fortune, when she has a caprice, resembles those women of
antiquity, who, when they had a fancy, were disgusted by no
physical or moral defects in either men or things.  Colbert,
placed with Michel Letellier, secretary of state in 1648, by his
cousin Colbert, Seigneur de Saint-Penange, who protected him,
received one day from the minister a commission for Cardinal
Mazarin.  His eminence was then in the enjoyment of flourishing
health, and the bad years of the Fronde had not yet counted
triple and quadruple for him.  He was at Sedan, very much annoyed
at a court intrigue in which Anne of Austria seemed inclined to
desert his cause.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Of this intrigue Letellier
held the thread.  He had just received a letter from Anne of
Austria, a letter very valuable to him, and strongly compromising
Mazarin; but, as he already played the double part which served
him so well, and by which he always managed two enemies so as to
draw advantage from both, either by embroiling them more and more
or by reconciling them, Michel Letellier wished to send Anne of
Austria's letter to Mazarin, in order that he might be acquainted
with it, and consequently pleased with his having so willingly
rendered him a service.  To send the letter was an easy matter;
to recover it again, after having communicated it, that was the
difficulty.  Letellier cast his eyes around him, and seeing the
black and meager clerk with the scowling brow, scribbling away in
his office, he preferred him to the best gendarme for the
execution of this design.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Colbert was commanded to set
out for Sedan, with positive orders to carry the letter to
Mazarin, and bring it back to Letellier.  He listened to his
orders with scrupulous attention, required the instructions to be
repeated twice, and was particular in learning whether the
bringing back was as necessary as the communicating, and
Letellier replied sternly, "More necessary."  Then he set out,
traveled like a courier, without any care for his body, and
placed in the hands of Mazarin, first a letter from Letellier,
which announced to the cardinal the sending of the precious
letter, and then that letter itself.  Mazarin colored greatly
whilst reading Anne of Austria's letter, gave Colbert a gracious
smile and dismissed him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "When shall I have the
answer, monseigneur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To-morrow."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To-morrow morning?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The clerk turned upon his
heel, after making his very best bow.  The next day he was at his
post at seven o'clock.  Mazarin made him wait till ten.  He
remained patiently in the ante-chamber; his turn having come, he
entered; Mazarin gave him a sealed packet.  On the envelope of
this packet were these words: - Monsieur Michel Letellier, etc. 
Colbert looked at the packet with much attention; the cardinal
put on a pleasant countenance and pushed him towards the
door.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And the letter of the
queen-mother, my lord?" asked Colbert.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is in with the rest, in
the packet," said Mazarin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! very well," replied
Colbert; and placing his hat between his knees, he began to
unseal the packet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Mazarin uttered a cry. 
"What are you doing?" said he, angrily.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am unsealing the packet,
my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You mistrust me, then,
master pedant, do you?  Did any one ever see such
impertinence?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! my lord, do not be
angry with me!  It is certainly not your eminence's word I place
in doubt, God forbid!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is the carefulness of
your chancery, my lord.  What is a letter?  A rag.  May not a rag
be forgotten?  And look, my lord, look if I was not right.  Your
clerks have forgotten the rag; the letter is not in the
packet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are an insolent fellow,
and you have not looked," cried Mazarin, very angrily; "begone
and wait my pleasure."  Whilst saying these words, with perfectly
Italian subtlety he snatched the packet from the hands of
Colbert, and re-entered his apartments.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                But this anger could not
last so long as to be replaced in time by reason.  Mazarin, every
morning, on opening his closet door, found the figure of Colbert
like a sentinel behind the bench, and this disagreeable figure
never failed to ask him humbly, but with tenacity, for the
queen-mother's letter.  Mazarin could hold out no longer, and was
obliged to give it up.  He accompanied this restitution with a
most severe reprimand, during which Colbert contented himself
with examining, feeling, even smelling, as it were, the paper,
the characters, and the signature, neither more nor less than if
he had to deal with the greatest forger in the kingdom.  Mazarin
behaved still more rudely to him, but Colbert, still impassible,
having obtained a certainty that the letter was the true one,
went off as if he had been deaf.  This conduct obtained for him
afterwards the post of Joubert; for Mazarin, instead of bearing
malice, admired him, and was desirous of attaching so much
fidelity to himself.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                It may be judged by this
single anecdote, what the character of Colbert was.  Events,
developing themselves, by degrees allowed all the powers of his
mind to act freely.  Colbert was not long in insinuating himself
to the good graces of the cardinal: he became even indispensable
to him.  The clerk was acquainted with all his accounts without
the cardinal's ever having spoken to him about them.  This secret
between them was a powerful tie, and this was why, when about to
appear before the Master of another world, Mazarin was desirous
of taking good counsel in disposing the wealth he was so
unwillingly obliged to leave in this world.  After the visit of
Gu&eacute;naud, he therefore sent for Colbert, desired him to sit
down, and said to him: "Let us converse, Monsieur Colbert, and
seriously, for I am very ill, and I may chance to die."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Man is mortal," replied
Colbert.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have always remembered
that, M. Colbert, and I have worked with that end in view.  You
know that I have amassed a little wealth."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I know you have,
monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "At how much do you
estimate, as near as you can, the amount of this wealth, M.
Colbert?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "At forty millions, five
hundred and sixty thousand, two hundred livres, nine cents, eight
farthings," replied Colbert.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The cardinal heaved a deep
sigh, and looked at Colbert with wonder, but he allowed a smile
to steal across his lips.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Known money," added
Colbert, in reply to that smile.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The cardinal gave quite a
start in bed.  "What do you mean by that?" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I mean," said Colbert,
"that besides those forty millions, five hundred and sixty
thousand, two hundred livres, nine cents, eight farthings, there
are thirteen millions that are not known."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Ouf!</i>" sighed
Mazarin, "what a man!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                At this moment, the head of
Bernouin appeared through the embrasure of the door.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What is it?" asked Mazarin,
"and why do you disturb me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The Th&eacute;atin father,
your eminence's director, was sent for this evening; and he
cannot come again to my lord till after to-morrow."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Mazarin looked a Colbert,
who rose and took his hat, saying: "I shall come again, my
lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Mazarin hesitated.  "No,
no," said he; "I have as much business to transact with you as
with him.  Besides, you are my other confessor - and what I have
to say to one the other may hear.  Remain where you are,
Colbert."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But my lord, if there be no
secret of penitence, will the director consent to my being
here?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do not trouble yourself
about that; come into the <i>ruelle</i>."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I can wait outside,
monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, no, it will do you good
to hear the confession of a rich man."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Colbert bowed and went into
the <i>ruelle</i>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Introduce the
Th&eacute;atin father," said Mazarin, closing the curtains.</p>

Th&eacute;atin entered deliberately, without being too much
astonished at the noise and agitation which anxiety for the
cardinal's health had raised in his household.  "Come in, my
reverend  father," said Mazarin, after a last look at the
<i>ruelle</i>, "come in and console me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is my duty, my lord,"
replied the Th&eacute;atin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Begin by sitting down, and
making yourself comfortable, for I am going to begin with a
general confession; you will afterwards give me a good
absolution, and I shall believe myself more tranquil."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord," said the father,
"you are not so ill as to make a general confession urgent - and
it will be very fatiguing - take care."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You suspect, then, that it
may be long, father?"</p>

otherwise, when a man has lived so completely as your eminence
has done?"</p>

the recital may be long."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The mercy of God is great,"
snuffled the Th&eacute;atin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Stop," said Mazarin; "there
I begin to terrify myself with having allowed so many things to
pass which the Lord might reprove."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is that not always so?"
said the Th&eacute;atin na&iuml;vely, removing further from the
lamp his thin pointed face, like that of a mole.  "Sinners are so
forgetful beforehand, and scrupulous when it is too late."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sinners?" replied Mazarin. 
"Do you use that word ironically, and to reproach me with all the
genealogies I have allowed to be made on my account - I - the son
of a fisherman, in fact?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                [This is quite
untranslatable - it being a play upon the words
<i>p&eacute;cheur</i>, a sinner, and <i>p&ecirc;cheur</i>, a
fisherman.  It is in very bad taste. - TRANS.]</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Hum!" said the
Th&eacute;atin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is a first sin,
father; for I have allowed myself made to descend from two old
Roman consuls, S. Geganius Macerinus 1st, Macerinus 2d, and
Proculus Macerinus 3d, of whom the Chronicle of Haolander
speaks.  From Macerinus to Mazarin the proximity was tempting. 
Macerinus, a diminutive, means leanish, poorish, out of case. 
Oh! reverend father!  Mazarini may now be carried to the
augmentative <i>Maigre</i>, thin as Lazarus.  Look!" - and he
showed his fleshless arms.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In your having been born of
a family of fishermen I see nothing injurious to you; for - St.
Peter was a fisherman; and if you are a prince of the church, my
lord, he was the supreme head of it.  Pass on, if you
please."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So much the more for my
having threatened with the Bastile a certain Bounet, a priest of
Avignon, who wanted to publish a genealogy of the Casa Mazarini
much too marvelous."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To be probable?" replied
the Th&eacute;atin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! if I had acted up to
his idea, father, that would have been the vice of pride -
another sin."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It was an excess of wit,
and a person is not to be reproached with such sorts of abuses. 
Pass on, pass on!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I was all pride.  Look you,
father, I will endeavor to divide that into capital sins."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I like divisions, when well
made."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am glad of that.  You
must know that in 1630 - alas! that is thirty-one years ago -
"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You were then twenty-nine
years old, monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A hot-headed age.  I was
then something of a soldier, and I threw myself at Casal into the
arquebusades, to show that I rode on horseback as well as an
officer.  It is true, I restored peace between the French and the
Spaniards.  That redeems my sin a little."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I see no sin in being able
to ride well on horseback," said the Th&eacute;atin; "that is in
perfect good taste, and does honor to our gown.  As a Christian,
I approve of your having prevented the effusion of blood; as a
monk, I am proud of the bravery a monk has exhibited."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Mazarin bowed his head
humbly.  "Yes," said he, "but the consequences?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What consequences?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eh! that damned sin of
pride has roots without end.  From the time that I threw myself
in that manner between two armies, that I had smelt powder and
faced lines of soldiers, I have held generals a little in
contempt."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah!" said the father.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "There is the evil; so that
I have not found one endurable since that time."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The fact is," said the
Th&eacute;atin, "that the generals we have had have not been
remarkable."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!" cried Mazarin, "there
was Monsieur le Prince.  I have tormented him thoroughly!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He is not much to be
pitied: he has acquired sufficient glory, and sufficient
wealth."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That may be, for Monsieur
le Prince; but M. Beaufort, for example - whom I held suffering
so long in the dungeon of Vincennes?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! but he was a rebel, and
the safety of the state required that you should make a
sacrifice.  Pass on!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I believe I have exhausted
pride.  There is another sin which I am afraid to qualify."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I can qualify it myself. 
Tell it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A great sin, reverend

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You cannot fail to have
heard of certain relations which I have had - with her majesty
the queen-mother; - the malevolent - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The malevolent, my lord,
are fools.  Was it not necessary for the good of the state and
the interests of the young king, that you should live in good
intelligence with the queen?  Pass on, pass on!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I assure you," said
Mazarin, "you remove a terrible weight from my breast."</p>

look for something serious."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have had much ambition,

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is the march of great
minds and things, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Even the longing for the
tiara?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To be pope is to be the
first of Christians.  Why should you not desire that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It has been printed that,
to gain that object, I had sold Cambria to the Spaniards."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You have, perhaps, yourself
written pamphlets without severely persecuting pamphleteers."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then, reverend father, I
have truly a clean breast.  I feel nothing remaining but slight
peccadilloes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What are they?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Play."</p>

you were obliged by the duties of greatness to keep a good
house."</p>

lose."</p>

neither his arms nor his lips.  "What are you waiting for,
father?" said Mazarin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am waiting for the
end."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The end of what?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Of the confession,

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Search diligently."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have searched as well as
possible."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then I shall assist your
memory."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The Th&eacute;atin coughed
several times.  "You have said nothing of avarice, another
capital sin, nor of those millions," said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What millions, father?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, those you possess, my
lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Father, that money is mine,
why should I speak to you about that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Because, you see, our
opinions differ.  You say that money is yours, whilst I - I
believe it is rather the property of others."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Mazarin lifted his cold hand
to his brow, which was beaded with perspiration.  "How so?"
stammered he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This way.  Your excellency
had gained much wealth - in the service of the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Hum! much - that is, not
too much."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Whatever it may be, whence
came that wealth?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "From the state."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The state; that is the
king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But what do you conclude
from that, father?" said Mazarin, who began to tremble.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I cannot conclude without
seeing a list of the riches you possess.  Let us reckon a little,
if you please.  You have the bishopric of Metz?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The abbeys of St. Clement,
St. Arnould, and St. Vincent, all at Metz?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You have the abbey of St.
Denis, in France, a magnificent property?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, father."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You have the abbey of
Cluny, which is rich?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That of St. M&eacute;dard
at Soissons, with a revenue of one hundred thousand livres?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I cannot deny it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That of St. Victor, at
Marseilles, - one of the best in the south?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes father."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A good million a year. 
With the emoluments of the cardinalship and the ministry, I say
too little when I say two millions a year."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eh!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In ten years that is twenty
millions - and twenty millions put out at fifty per cent. give,
by progression, twenty-three millions in ten years."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How well you reckon for a
Th&eacute;atin!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Since your eminence placed
our order in the convent we occupy, near St. Germain des
Pr&eacute;s, in 1644, I have kept the accounts of the
society."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And mine likewise,
apparently, father."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "One ought to know a little
of everything, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very well.  Conclude, at
present."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I conclude that your
baggage is too heavy to allow you to pass through the gates of
Paradise."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Shall I be damned?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "If you do not make
restitution, yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Mazarin uttered a piteous
cry.  "Restitution! - but to whom, good God?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To the owner of that money,
- to the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But the king did not give
it all to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "One moment, - does not the
king sign the <i>ordonances?</i>"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Mazarin passed from sighs to
groans.  "Absolution! absolution!" cried he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Impossible, my lord. 
Restitution! restitution!" replied the Th&eacute;atin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But you absolve me from all
other sins, why not from that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Because," replied the
father, "to absolve you for that motive would be a sin for which
the king would never absolve me, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Thereupon the confessor
quitted his penitent with an air full of compunction.  He then
went out in the same manner he had entered.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, good God!" groaned the
cardinal.  "Come here, Colbert, I am very, very ill indeed, my
friend."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Alas! yes, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Can he be right?  Can all
this money be badly acquired?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A Th&eacute;atin,
monseigneur, is a bad judge in matters of finance," replied
Colbert, coolly.  "And yet it is very possible that, according to
his theological views, your eminence has been, in a certain
degree, in the wrong.  People generally find they have been so, -
when they die."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In the first place, they
commit the wrong of dying, Colbert."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is true, my lord. 
Against whom, however, did the Th&eacute;atin make out that you
had committed these wrongs?  Against the king?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Mazarin shrugged his
shoulders.  "As if I had not saved both his state and his
finances."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That admits of no
contradiction, my lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Does it?  Then I have
received a merely legitimate salary, in spite of the opinion of
my confessor?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is beyond doubt."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And I might fairly keep for
my own family, which is so needy, a good fortune, - the whole,
even, of which I have earned?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I see no impediment to
that, monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I felt assured that in
consulting you, Colbert, I should have good advice," replied
Mazarin, greatly delighted.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Colbert resumed his pedantic
look.  "My lord," interrupted he, "I think it would be quite as
well to examine whether what the Th&eacute;atin said is not a
<i>snare</i>."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! no; a snare?  What
for?  The Th&eacute;atin is an honest man."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He believed your eminence
to be at death's door, because your eminence consulted him.  Did
I not hear him say - 'Distinguish that which the king has given
you from that which you have given yourself.'  Recollect, my
lord, if he did not say something a little like that to you? -
that is quite a theatrical speech."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is possible."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In which case, my lord, I
should consider you as required by the Th&eacute;atin to - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To make restitution!" cried
Mazarin, with great warmth.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eh!  I do not say no."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What, of all!  You do not
dream of such a thing!  You speak just as the confessor did."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To make restitution of a
part, - that is to say, his majesty's part; and that,
monseigneur, may have its dangers.  Your eminence is too skillful
a politician not to know that, at this moment, the king does not
possess a hundred and fifty thousand livres clear in his
coffers."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is not my affair,"
said Mazarin, triumphantly; "that belongs to M. le Surintendant
Fouquet, whose accounts I gave you to verify some months
ago."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Colbert bit his lips at the
name of Fouquet.  "His majesty," said he, between his teeth, "has
no money but that which M. Fouquet collects: your money,
monseigneur, would afford him a delicious banquet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, but I am not the
superintendent of his majesty's finances - I have my purse -
surely I would do much for his majesty's welfare - some legacy -
but I cannot disappoint my family."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The legacy of a part would
dishonor you and offend the king.  Leaving a part to his majesty,
is to avow that that part has inspired you with doubts as to the
lawfulness of the means of acquisition."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur Colbert!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I thought your eminence did
me the honor to ask my advice?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, but you are ignorant
of the principal details of the question."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am ignorant of nothing,
my lord; during ten years, all the columns of figures which are
found in France, have passed into review before me; and if I have
painfully nailed them into my brain, they are there now so well
riveted, that, from the office of M. Letellier, who is sober, to
the little secret largesses of M. Fouquet, who is prodigal, I
could recite, figure by figure, all the money that is spent in
France from Marseilles to Cherbourg."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then, you would have me
throw all my money into the coffers of the king!" cried Mazarin,
ironically; and from whom, at the same time the gout forced
painful moans.  "Surely the king would reproach me with nothing,
but he would laugh at me, while squandering my millions, and with
good reason."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your eminence has
misunderstood me.  I did not, the least in the world, pretend
that his majesty ought to spend your money."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You said so, clearly, it
seems to me, when you advised me to give it to him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah," replied Colbert, "that
is because your eminence, absorbed as you are by your disease,
entirely loses sight of the character of Louis XIV."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How so?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That character, if I may
venture to express myself thus, resembles that which my lord
confessed just now to the Th&eacute;atin."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Go on - that is?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Pride!  Pardon me, my lord,
haughtiness, nobleness; kings have no pride, that is a human
passion."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Pride, - yes, you are
right.  Next?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, my lord, if I have
divined rightly, your eminence has but to give all your money to
the king, and that immediately."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But for what?" said
Mazarin, quite bewildered.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Because the king will not
accept of the whole."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What, and he a young man,
and devoured by ambition?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Just so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A young man who is anxious
for my death - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To inherit, yes, Colbert,
yes; he is anxious for my death, in order to inherit.  Triple
fool that I am!  I would prevent him!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Exactly: if the donation
were made in a certain form he would refuse it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well; but how?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is plain enough.  A
young man who has yet done nothing - who burns to distinguish
himself - who burns to reign alone, will never take anything
ready built, he will construct for himself.  This prince,
monseigneur, will never be content with the Palais Royal, which
M. de Richelieu left him, nor with the Palais Mazarin, which you
have had so superbly constructed, nor with the Louvre, which his
ancestors inhabited; nor with St. Germain, where he was born. 
All that does not proceed from himself, I predict, he will
disdain."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you will guarantee,
that if I give my forty millions to the king - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Saying certain things to
him at the same time, I guarantee he will refuse them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But those things - what are
they?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I will write them, if my
lord will have the goodness to dictate them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, but, after all, what
advantage will that be to me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "An enormous one.  Nobody
will afterwards be able to accuse your eminence of that unjust
avarice with which pamphleteers have reproached the most
brilliant mind of the present age."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are right, Colbert, you
are right; go, and seek the king, on my part, and take him my
will."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your donation, my
lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But, if he should accept
it; if he should even think of accepting it!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then there would remain
thirteen millions for your family, and that is a good round
sum."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But then <i>you</i> would
be either a fool or a traitor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And I am neither the one
nor the other, my lord.  You appear to be much afraid that the
king will accept; you have a deal more reason to fear that he
will not accept."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But, see you, if he does
not accept, I should like to guarantee my thirteen reserved
millions to him - yes, I will do so - yes.  But my pains are
returning, I shall faint.  I am very, very ill, Colbert; I am
near my end!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Colbert started.  The
cardinal was indeed very ill; large drops of sweat flowed down
upon his bed of agony, and the frightful pallor of a face
streaming with water was a spectacle which the most hardened
practitioner could not have beheld without much compassion. 
Colbert was, without doubt, very much affected, for he quitted
the chamber, calling Bernouin to attend to the dying man, and
went into the corridor.  There, walking about with a meditative
expression, which almost gave nobility to his vulgar head, his
shoulders thrown up, his neck stretched out, his lips half open,
to give vent to unconnected fragments of incoherent thoughts, he
lashed up his courage to the pitch of the undertaking
contemplated, whilst within ten paces of him, separated only by a
wall, his master was being stifled by anguish which drew from him
lamentable cries, thinking no more of the treasures of the earth,
or of the joys of Paradise, but much of all the horrors of hell. 
Whilst burning-hot napkins, physic, revulsives, and
Gu&eacute;naud, who was recalled, were performing their functions
with increased activity, Colbert, holding his great head in both
his hands, to compress within it the fever of the projects
engendered by the brain, was meditating the tenor of the donation
he would make Mazarin write, at the first hour of respite his
disease should afford him.  It would appear as if all the cries
of the cardinal, and all the attacks of death upon this
representative of the past, were stimulants for the genius of
this thinker with the bushy eyebrows, who was turning already
towards the rising sun of a regenerated society.  Colbert resumed
his place at Mazarin's pillow at the first interval of pain, and
persuaded him to dictate a donation thus conceived.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "About to appear before God,
the Master of mankind, I beg the king, who was my master on
earth, to resume the wealth which his bounty has bestowed upon
me, and which my family would be happy to see pass into such
illustrious hands.  The particulars of my property will be found
- they are drawn up - at the first requisition of his majesty, or
at the last sigh of his most devoted servant,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The cardinal sighed heavily
as he signed this; Colbert sealed the packet, and carried it
immediately to the Louvre, whither the king had returned.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                He then went back to his own
home, rubbing his hands with the confidence of  workman who has
done a good day's work.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=

the extreme illness of the cardinal had already spread, and
attracted at least as much attention among the people of the
Louvre as the news of the marriage of Monsieur, the king's
brother, which had already been announced as an official fact. 
Scarcely had Louis XIV. returned home, with his thoughts fully
occupied with the various things he had seen and heard in the
course of the evening, when an usher announced that the same
crowd of courtiers who, in the morning, had thronged his
<i>lever</i>, presented themselves again at his <i>coucher</i>, a
remarkable piece of respect which, during the reign of the
cardinal, the court, not very discreet in its performance, had
accorded to the minister, without caring about displeasing the
king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                But the minister had had, as
we have said, an alarming attack of gout, and the tide of
flattery was mounting towards the throne.  Courtiers have a
marvelous instinct in scenting the turn of events; courtiers
possess a supreme kind of science; they are diplomatists in
throwing light upon the unraveling of complicated intrigues,
captains in divining the issue of battles, and physicians in
curing the sick.  Louis XIV., to whom his mother had taught this
axiom, together with many others, understood at once that the
cardinal must be very ill.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Scarcely had Anne of Austria
conducted the young queen to her apartments and taken from her
brow the head-dress of ceremony, when she went to see her son in
his cabinet, where, alone, melancholy, and depressed, he was
indulging, as if to exercise his will, in one of those terrible
inward passions - king's passions - which create events when they
break out, and with Louis XIV., thanks to his astonishing command
over himself, became such benign tempests, that his most violent,
his only passion, that which Saint Simon mentions with
astonishment, was that famous fit of anger which he exhibited
fifty years later, on the occasion of a little concealment of the
Duc de Maine's, and which had for result a shower of blows
inflicted with a cane upon the back of a poor valet who had
stolen a biscuit.  The young king then was, as we have seen, a
prey to a double excitement; and he said to himself as he looked
in a glass, "O king! - king by name, and not in fact; - phantom,
vain phantom art thou! - inert statue, which has no other power
than that of provoking salutations from courtiers, when wilt thou
be able to raise thy velvet arm, or clench thy silken hand? when
wilt thou be able to open, for any purpose but to sigh, or smile,
lips condemned to the motionless stupidity of the marbles in thy
gallery?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Then, passing his hand over
his brow, and feeling the want of air, he approached a window,
and looking down, saw below some horsemen talking together, and
groups of timid observers.  These horsemen were a fraction of the
watch: the groups were busy portions of the people, to whom a
king is always a curious thing, the same as a rhinoceros, a
crocodile, or a serpent.  He struck his brow with his open hand,
crying, - "King of France! what a title!  People of France! what
a heap of creatures!  I have just returned to my Louvre; my
horses, just unharnessed, are still smoking, and I have created
interest enough to induce scarcely twenty persons to look at me
as I passed.  Twenty! what do I say? no; there were not twenty
anxious to see the king of France.  There are not even ten
archers to guard my palace of residence: archers, people, guards,
all are at the Palais Royal!  Why, my good God! have not I, the
king, the right to ask of you all that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Because," said a voice,
replying to his, and which sounded from the other side of the
door of the cabinet, "because at the Palais Royal lies all the
gold, - that is to say, all the power of him who desires to
reign."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis turned round sharply. 
The voice which had pronounced these words was that of Anne of
Austria.  The king started, and advanced towards her.  "I hope,"
said he, "you majesty has paid no attention to the vain
declamations which the solitude and disgust familiar to kings
suggest to the happiest dispositions?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I only paid attention to
one thing, my son, and that was, that you were complaining."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who!  I?  Not at all," said
Louis XIV.; "no, in truth, you err, madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What were you doing,
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I thought I was under the
ferule of my professor, and developing a subject of
amplification."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My son," replied Anne of
Austria, shaking her head, "you are wrong not to trust my word;
you are wrong not to grant me your confidence.  A day will come,
and perhaps quickly, wherein you will have occasion to remember
that axiom: - 'Gold is universal power; and they alone are kings
who are all-powerful.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your intention," continued
the king, "was not, however, to cast blame upon the rich men of
this age, was it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No," said the queen,
warmly; "no, sire; they who are rich in this age, under your
reign, are rich because you have been willing they should be so,
and I entertain against them neither malice nor envy; they have,
without doubt, served your majesty sufficiently well for your
majesty to have permitted them to reward themselves.  That is
what I mean to say by the words for which you reproach me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "God forbid, madame, that I
should ever reproach my mother with anything!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Besides," continued Anne of
Austria, "the Lord never gives the goods of this world but for a
season; the Lord - as correctives to honor and riches - the Lord
has placed sufferings, sickness, and death; and no one," added
she, with a melancholy smile, which proved she made the
application of the funeral precept to herself, "no man can take
his wealth or greatness with him to the grave.  It results,
therefore, that the young gather the abundant harvest prepared
for them by the old."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis listened with
increased attention to the words which Anne of Austria, no doubt,
pronounced with a view to console him.  "Madame," said he,
looking earnestly at his mother, "one would almost say in truth
that you had something else to announce to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have absolutely nothing,
my son; only you cannot have failed to remark that his eminence
the cardinal is very ill."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis looked at his mother,
expecting some emotion in her voice, some sorrow in her
countenance.  The face of Anne of Austria appeared a little
changed, but that was from sufferings of quite a personal
character.  Perhaps the alteration was caused by the cancer which
had begun to consume her breast.  "Yes, madame," said the king;
"yes, M. de Mazarin is very ill."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And it would be a great
loss to the kingdom if God were to summon his eminence away.  Is
not that your opinion as well as mine, my son?" said the
queen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, madame; yes,
certainly, it would be a great loss for the kingdom," said Louis,
coloring; "but the peril does not seem to me to be so great;
besides, the cardinal is still young."  The king had scarcely
ceased speaking when an usher lifted the tapestry, and stood with
a paper in his hand, waiting for the king to speak to him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What have you there?" asked
the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A message from M. de
Mazarin," replied the usher.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Give it to me," said the
king; and he took the paper.  But at the moment he was about to
open it, there was a great noise in the gallery, the
ante-chamber, and the court.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, ah," said Louis XIV.,
who doubtless knew the meaning of that triple noise.  "How could
I say there was but one king in France!  I was mistaken, there
are two."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                As he spoke or thought thus,
the door opened, and the superintendent of finances, Fouquet,
appeared before his nominal master.  It was he who made the noise
in the ante-chamber, it was his horse that made the noise in the
courtyard.  In addition to all this, a loud murmur was heard
along his passage, which did not die away till some time after he
had passed.  It was this murmur which Louis XIV. regretted so
deeply not hearing as he passed, and dying away behind him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He is not precisely a king,
as you fancy," said Anne of Austria to her son; "he is only a man
who is much too rich - that is all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Whilst saying these words, a
bitter feeling gave to these words of the queen a most hateful
expression; whereas the brow of the king, calm and
self-possessed, on the contrary, was without the slightest
wrinkle.  He nodded, therefore, familiarly to Fouquet, whilst he
continued to unfold the paper given to him by the usher.  Fouquet
perceived this movement, and with a politeness at once easy and
respectful, advanced towards the queen, so as not to disturb the
king.  Louis had opened the paper, and yet he did not read it. 
He listened to Fouquet paying the most charming compliments to
the queen upon her hand and arm.  Anne of Austria's frown relaxed
a little, she even almost smiled.  Fouquet perceived that the
king, instead of reading, was looking at him; he turned half
round, therefore, and while continuing his conversation with the
queen, faced the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You know, Monsieur
Fouquet," said Louis, "how ill M. Mazarin is?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire, I know that,"
said Fouquet; "in fact, he is very ill.  I was at my
country-house of Vaux when the news reached me; and the affair
seemed so pressing that I left at once."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You left Vaux this evening,
monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "An hour and a half ago,
yes, your majesty," said Fouquet, consulting a watch, richly
ornamented with diamonds.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "An hour and a half!" said
the king, still able to restrain his anger, but not to conceal
his astonishment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I understand you, sire. 
Your majesty doubts my word, and you have reason to do so; but I
have really come in that time, though it is wonderful!  I
received from England three pairs of very fast horses, as I had
been assured.  They were placed at distances of four leagues
apart, and I tried them this evening.  They really brought me
from Vaux to the Louvre in an hour and a half, so your majesty
sees I have not been cheated."  The queen-mother smiled with
something like secret envy.  But Fouquet caught her thought. 
"Thus, madame," he promptly said, "such horses are made for
kings, not for subjects; for kings ought never to yield to any
one in anything."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king looked up.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And yet," interrupted Anne
of Austria, "you are not a king, that I know of, M. Fouquet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Truly not, madame;
therefore the horses only await the orders of his majesty to
enter the royal stables; and if I allowed myself to try them, it
was only for fear of offering to the king anything that was not
positively wonderful."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king became quite
red.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You know, Monsieur
Fouquet," said the queen, "that at the court of France it is not
the custom for a subject to offer anything to his king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis started.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I hoped, madame," said
Fouquet, much agitated, "that my love for his majesty, my
incessant desire to please him, would serve to compensate the
want of etiquette.  It was not so much a present that I permitted
myself to offer, as the tribute I paid."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thank you, Monsieur
Fouquet," said the king politely, "and I am gratified by your
intention, for I love good horses; but you know I am not very
rich; you, who are my superintendent of finances, know it better
than any one else.  I am not able, then, however willing I may
be, to purchase such a valuable set of horses."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Fouquet darted a haughty
glance at the queen-mother, who appeared to triumph at the false
position in which the minister had placed himself, and replied:
-</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Luxury is the virtue of
kings, sire: it is luxury which makes them resemble God; it is by
luxury they are more than other men.  With luxury a king
nourishes his subjects, and honors them.  Under the mild heat of
this luxury of kings springs the luxury of individuals, a source
of riches for the people.  His majesty, by accepting the gift of
these six incomparable horses, would stimulate the pride of his
own breeders, of Limousin, Perche, and Normandy; and this
emulation would have been beneficial to all.  But the king is
silent, and consequently I am condemned."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                During this speech, Louis
was, unconsciously, folding and unfolding Mazarin's paper, upon
which he had not cast his eyes.  At length he glanced upon it,
and uttered a faint cry at reading the first line.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What is the matter, my
son?" asked the queen, anxiously, and going towards the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "From the cardinal," replied
the king, continuing to read; "yes, yes, it is really from
him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is he worse, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Read!" said the king,
passing the parchment to his mother, as if he thought that
nothing less than reading would convince Anne of Austria of a
thing so astonishing as was conveyed in that paper.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Anne of Austria read in
turn, and as she read, her eyes sparkled with joy all the greater
from her useless endeavor to hide it, which attracted the
attention of Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! a regularly drawn up
deed of gift," said she.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A gift?" repeated
Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes," said the king,
replying pointedly to the superintendent of finances, "yes, at
the point of death, monsieur le cardinal makes me a donation of
all his wealth."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Forty millions," cried the
queen.  "Oh, my son! this is very noble on the part of his
eminence, and will silence all malicious rumors; forty millions
scraped together slowly, coming back all in one heap to the
treasury!  It is the act of a faithful subject and a good
Christian."  And having once more cast her eyes over the act, she
restored it to Louis XIV., whom the announcement of the sum
greatly agitated.  Fouquet had taken some steps backwards and
remained silent.  The king looked at him, and held the paper out
to him, in turn.  The superintendent only bestowed a haughty look
of a second upon it; then bowing, - "Yes, sire," said he, "a
donation, I see."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You must reply to it, my
son," said Anne of Austria; "you must reply to it, and
immediately."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But how, madame?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "By a visit to the
cardinal."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, it is but an hour
since I left his eminence," said the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Write, then, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Write!" said the young
king, with evident repugnance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well!" replied Anne of
Austria, "it seems to me, my son, that a man who has just made
such a present, has a good right to expect to be thanked for it
with some degree of promptitude."  Then turning towards Fouquet:
"Is not that likewise your opinion, monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That the present is worth
the trouble?  Yes, madame," said Fouquet, with a lofty air that
did not escape the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Accept, then, and thank
him," insisted Anne of Austria.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What says M. Fouquet?"
asked Louis XIV.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Does your majesty wish to
know my opinion?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thank him, sire - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah!" said the queen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But do not accept,"
continued Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And why not?" asked the
queen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You have yourself said why,
madame," replied Fouquet; "because kings cannot and ought not to
receive presents from their subjects."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king remained silent
between these two contrary opinions.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But forty millions!" said
Anne of Austria, in the same tone as that in which, at a later
period, poor Marie Antoinette replied, "You will tell me as
much!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I know," said Fouquet,
laughing, "forty millions makes a good round sum, - such a sum as
could almost tempt a royal conscience."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But, monsieur," said Anne
of Austria, "instead of persuading the king not to receive this
present, recall to his majesty's mind, you, whose duty it is,
that these forty millions are a fortune to him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is precisely, madame,
because these forty millions would be a fortune that I will say
to the king, 'Sire, if it be not decent for a king to accept from
a subject six horses, worth twenty thousand livres, it would be
disgraceful for him to owe a fortune to another subject, more or
less scrupulous in the choice of the materials which contributed
to the building up of that fortune.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It ill becomes you,
monsieur, to give your king a lesson," said Anne of Austria;
"better procure for him forty millions to replace those you make
him lose."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The king shall have them
whenever he wishes," said the superintendent of finances,
bowing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, by oppressing the
people," said the queen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And were they not
oppressed, madame," replied Fouquet, "when they were made to
sweat the forty millions given by this deed?  Furthermore, his
majesty has asked my opinion, I have given it; if his majesty ask
my concurrence, it will be the same."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Nonsense! accept, my son,
accept," said Anne of Austria.  "You are above reports and
interpretations."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Refuse, sire," said
Fouquet.  "As long as a king lives, he has no other measure but
his conscience, - no other judge than his own desires; but when
dead, he has posterity, which applauds or accuses."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thank you, mother," replied
Louis, bowing respectfully to the queen.  "Thank you, Monsieur
Fouquet," said he, dismissing the superintendent civilly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do you accept?" asked Anne
of Austria, once more.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I shall consider of it,"
replied he, looking at Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>T</span>he day that
the deed of gift had been sent to the king, the cardinal caused
himself to be transported to Vincennes.  The king and the court
followed him thither.  The last flashes of this torch still cast
splendor enough around to absorb all other lights in its rays. 
Besides, as it has been seen, the faithful satellite of his
minister, young Louis XIV., marched to the last minute in
accordance with his gravitation.  The disease, as Gu&eacute;naud
had predicted, had become worse; it was no longer an attack of
gout, it was an attack of death; then there was another thing
which made that agony more agonizing still, - and that was the
agitation brought into his mind by the donation he had sent to
the king, and which, according to Colbert, the king ought to send
back unaccepted to the cardinal.  The cardinal had, as we have
said, great faith in the predictions of his secretary; but the
sum was a large one, and whatever might be the genius of Colbert,
from time to time the cardinal thought to himself that the
Th&eacute;atin also might possibly have been mistaken, and there
was at least as much chance of his not being damned, as there was
of Louis XIV. sending back his millions.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Besides, the longer the
donation was in coming back, the more Mazarin thought that forty
millions were worth a little risk, particularly of so hypothetic
a thing as the soul.  Mazarin, in his character of cardinal and
prime minister, was almost an atheist, and quite a materialist. 
Every time that the door opened, he turned sharply round towards
that door, expecting to see the return of his unfortunate
donation; then, deceived in his hope, he fell back again with a
sigh, and found his pains so much the greater for having
forgotten them for an instant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Anne of Austria had also
followed the cardinal; her heart, though age had made it selfish,
could not help evincing towards the dying man a sorrow which she
owed him as a wife, according to some; and as a sovereign,
according to others.  She had, in some sort, put on a mourning
countenance beforehand, and all the court wore it as she did.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis, in order not to show
on his face what was passing at the bottom of his heart,
persisted in remaining in his own apartments, where his nurse
alone kept him company; the more he saw the approach of the time
when all constraint would be at an end, the more humble and
patient he was, falling back upon himself, as all strong men do
when they form great designs, in order to gain more spring at the
decisive moment.  Extreme unction had been administered to the
cardinal, who, faithful to his habits of dissimulation, struggled
against appearances, and even against reality, receiving company
in his bed, as if he only suffered from a temporary
complaint.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Gu&eacute;naud, on his part,
preserved profound secrecy; wearied with visits and questions, he
answered nothing but "his eminence is still full of youth and
strength, but God wills that which He wills, and when He has
decided that man is to be laid low, he will be laid low."  These
words, which he scattered with a sort of discretion, reserve, and
preference, were commented upon earnestly by two persons, - the
king and the cardinal.  Mazarin, notwithstanding the prophecy of
Gu&eacute;naud, still lured himself with a hope, or rather played
his part so well, that the most cunning, when saying that he
lured himself, proved that they were his dupes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis, absent from the
cardinal for two days; Louis, with his eyes fixed upon that same
donation which so constantly preoccupied the cardinal; Louis did
not exactly know how to make out Mazarin's conduct.  The son of
Louis XIII., following the paternal traditions, had, up to that
time, been so little of a king that, whilst ardently desiring
royalty, he desired it with that terror which always accompanies
the unknown.  Thus, having formed his resolution, which, besides,
he communicated to nobody, he determined to have an interview
with Mazarin.  It was Anne of Austria, who, constant in her
attendance upon the cardinal, first heard this proposition of the
king's, and transmitted it to the dying man, whom it greatly
agitated.  For what purpose could Louis wish for an interview? 
Was it to return the deed, as Colbert had said he would?  Was it
to keep it, after thanking him, as Mazarin thought he would? 
Nevertheless, as the dying man felt that the uncertainty
increased his torments, he did not hesitate an instant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "His majesty will be
welcome, - yes, very welcome," cried he, making a sign to
Colbert, who was seated at the foot of the bed, and which the
latter understood perfectly.  "Madame," continued Mazarin, "will
your majesty be good enough to assure the king yourself of the
truth of what I have just said?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Anne of Austria rose; she
herself was anxious to have the question of the forty millions
settled - the question which seemed to lie heavy on the mind of
everyone.  Anne of Austria went out; Mazarin made a great effort,
and, raising himself up towards Colbert: "Well, Colbert," said
he, "two days have passed away - two mortal days - and, you see,
nothing has been returned from yonder."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Patience, my lord," said
Colbert.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Are you mad, you wretch? 
You advise me to have patience!  Oh, in sad truth, Colbert, you
are laughing at me.  I am dying and you call out to me to
wait!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord," said Colbert,
with his habitual coolness, "it is impossible that things should
not come out as I have said.  His majesty is coming to see you,
and no doubt he brings back the deed himself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do you think so?  Well, I,
on the contrary, am sure that his majesty is coming to thank
me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                At this moment Anne of
Austria returned.  On her way to the apartments of her son she
had met with a new empiric.  This was a powder which was said to
have power to save the cardinal; and she brought a portion of
this powder with her.  But this was not what Mazarin expected;
therefore he would not even look at it, declaring that life was
not worth the pains that were taken to preserve it.  But, whilst
professing this philosophical axiom, his long-confined secret
escaped him at last.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That, madame," said he,
"that is not the interesting part of my situation.  I made, two
days ago, a little donation to the king; up to this time, from
delicacy, no doubt, his majesty has not condescended to say
anything about it; but the time for explanation is come, and I
implore your majesty to tell me if the king has made up his mind
on that matter."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Anne of Austria was about to
reply, when Mazarin stopped her.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The truth, madame," said he
- "in the name of Heaven, the truth!  Do not flatter a dying man
with a hope that may prove vain."  There he stopped, a look from
Colbert telling him he was on the wrong track.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I know," said Anne of
Austria, taking the cardinal's hand, "I know that you have
generously made, not a little donation, as you modestly call it,
but a magnificent gift.  I know how painful it would be to you if
the king - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Mazarin listened, dying as
he was, as ten living men could not have listened.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "If the king - " replied
he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "If the king," continued
Anne of Austria, "should not freely accept what you offer so
nobly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Mazarin allowed himself to
sink back upon his pillow like Pantaloon; that is to say, with
all the despair of a man who bows before the tempest; but he
still preserved sufficient strength and presence of mind to cast
upon Colbert one of those looks which are well worth ten sonnets,
which is to say, ten long poems.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Should you not," added the
queen, "have considered the refusal of the king as a sort of
insult?"  Mazarin rolled his head about upon his pillow, without
articulating a syllable.  The queen was deceived, or feigned to
be deceived, by this demonstration.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Therefore," resumed she, "I
have circumvented him with good counsels; and as certain minds,
jealous, no doubt, of the glory you are about to acquire by this
generosity, have endeavored to prove to the king that he ought
not to accept this donation, I have struggled in your favor, and
so well I have struggled, that you will not have, I hope, that
distress to undergo."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah!" murmured Mazarin, with
languishing eyes, "ah! that is a service I shall never forget for
a single minute of the few hours I still have to live."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I must admit," continued
the queen, "that it was not without trouble I rendered it to your
eminence."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, <i>peste!</i>  I
believe that.  Oh! oh!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good God! what is the
matter?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am burning!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do you suffer much?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "As much as one of the
damned."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Colbert would have liked to
sink through the floor.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So, then," resumed Mazarin,
"your majesty thinks that the king - " he stopped several seconds
- "that the king is coming here to offer me some small
thanks?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I think so," said queen. 
Mazarin annihilated Colbert with his last look.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                At that moment the ushers
announced that the king was in the ante-chambers, which were
filled with people.  This announcement produced a stir of which
Colbert took advantage to escape by the door of the
<i>ruelle</i>.  Anne of Austria arose, and awaited her son,
standing.  Louis XIV. appeared at the threshold of the door, with
his eyes fixed upon the dying man, who did not even think it
worth while to notice that majesty from whom he thought he had
nothing more to expect.  An usher placed an armchair close to the
bed.  Louis bowed to his mother, then to the cardinal, and sat
down.  The queen took a seat in her turn.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Then, as the king looked
behind him, the usher understood that look, and made a sign to
the courtiers who filled up the doorway to go out, which they
instantly did.  Silence fell upon the chamber with the velvet
curtains.  The king, still very young, and very timid in the
presence of him who had been his master from his birth, still
respected him much, particularly now, in the supreme majesty of
death.  He did not dare, therefore, to begin the conversation,
feeling that every word must have its weight not only upon things
of this world, but of the next.  As to the cardinal, at that
moment he had but one thought - his donation.  It was not
physical pain which gave him that air of despondency, and that
lugubrious look; it was the expectation of the thanks that were
about to issue from the king's mouth, and cut off all hope of
restitution.  Mazarin was the first to break the silence.  "Is
your majesty come to make any stay at Vincennes?" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis made an affirmative
sign with his head.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is a gracious favor,"
continued Mazarin, "granted to a dying man, and which will render
death less painful to him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I hope," replied the king,
"I am come to visit, not a dying man, but a sick man, susceptible
of cure."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Mazarin replied by a
movement of the head.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your majesty is very kind;
but I know more than you on that subject.  The last visit, sire,"
said he, "the last visit."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "If it were so, monsieur le
cardinal," said Louis, "I would come a last time to ask the
counsels of a guide to whom I owe everything."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Anne of Austria was a woman;
she could not restrain her tears.  Louis showed himself much
affected, and Mazarin still more than his two guests, but from
very different motives.  Here the silence returned.  The queen
wiped her eyes, and the king resumed his firmness.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I was saying," continued
the king, "that I owed much to your eminence."  The eyes of the
cardinal had devoured the king, for he felt the great moment had
come.  "And," continued Louis, "the principal object of my visit
was to offer you very sincere thanks for the last evidence of
friendship you have kindly sent me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The cheeks of the cardinal
became sunken, his lips partially opened, and the most lamentable
sigh he had ever uttered was about to issue from his chest.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire," said he, "I shall
have despoiled my poor family; I shall have ruined all who belong
to me, which may be imputed to me as an error; but, at least, it
shall not be said of me that I have refused to sacrifice
everything to my king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Anne of Austria's tears
flowed afresh.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My dear Monsieur Mazarin,"
said the king, in a more serious tone than might have been
expected from his youth, "you have misunderstood me,
apparently."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Mazarin raised himself upon
his elbow.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have no purpose to
despoil your dear family, nor to ruin your servants.  Oh, no,
that must never be!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Humph!" thought Mazarin,
"he is going to restore me some scraps; let us get the largest
piece we can."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The king is going to be
foolishly affected and play generous," thought the queen; "he
must not be allowed to impoverish himself; such an opportunity
for getting a fortune will never occur again."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire," said the cardinal,
aloud, "my family is very numerous, and my nieces will be
destitute when I am gone."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh," interrupted the queen,
eagerly, "have no uneasiness with respect to your family, dear
Monsieur Mazarin; we have no friends dearer than your friends;
your nieces shall be my children, the sisters of his majesty; and
if a favor be distributed in France, it shall be to those you
love."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Smoke!" thought Mazarin,
who knew better than any one the faith that can be put in the
promises of kings.  Louis read the dying man's thought in his
face.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Be comforted, my dear
Monsieur Mazarin," said he, with a half-smile, sad beneath its
irony; "the Mesdemoiselles de Mancini will lose, in losing you,
their most precious good; but they shall none the less be the
richest heiresses of France; and since you have been kind enough
to give me their dowry" - the cardinal was panting - "I restore
it to them," continued Louis, drawing from his breast and holding
towards the cardinal's bed the parchment which contained the
donation that, during two days, had kept alive such tempests in
the mind of Mazarin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What did I tell you, my
lord?" murmured in the alcove a voice which passed away like a
breath.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your majesty returns my
donation!" cried Mazarin, so disturbed by joy as to forget his
character of a benefactor.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your majesty rejects the
forty millions!" cried Anne of Austria, so stupefied as to forget
her character of an afflicted wife, or queen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, my lord cardinal; yes,
madame," replied Louis XIV., tearing the parchment which Mazarin
had not yet ventured to clutch; "yes, I annihilate this deed,
which despoiled a whole family.  The wealth acquired by his
eminence in my service is his own wealth and not mine."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But, sire, does your
majesty reflect," said Anne of Austria, "that you have not ten
thousand crowns in your coffers?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Madame, I have just
performed my first royal action, and I hope it will worthily
inaugurate my reign."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! sire, you are right!"
cried Mazarin; "that is truly great - that is truly generous
which you have just done."  And he looked, one after the other,
at the pieces of the act spread over his bed, to assure himself
that it was the original and not a copy that had been torn.  At
length his eyes fell upon the fragment which bore his signature,
and recognizing it, he sunk back on his bolster in a swoon.  Anne
of Austria, without strength to conceal her regret, raised her
hands and eyes towards heaven.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! sire," cried Mazarin,
"may you be blessed!  My God!  May you be beloved by all my
family.  <i>Per Baccho!</i>  If ever any of those belonging to me
should cause your displeasure, sire, only frown, and I will rise
from my tomb!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This <i>pantalonnade</i> did
not produce all the effect Mazarin had counted upon.  Louis had
already passed to considerations of a higher nature, and as to
Anne of Austria, unable to bear, without abandoning herself to
the anger she felt burning within her, the magnanimity of her son
and the hypocrisy of the cardinal, she arose and left the
chamber, heedless of thus betraying the extent of her grief. 
Mazarin saw all this, and fearing that Louis XIV. might repent
his decision, in order to draw attention another way he began to
cry out, as, at a later period, Scapin was to cry out, in that
sublime piece of pleasantry with which the morose and grumbling
Boileau dared to reproach Moli&egrave;re.  His cries, however, by
degrees, became fainter; and when Anne of Austria left the
apartment, they ceased altogether.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur le cardinal," said
the king, "have you any recommendations to make me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire," replied Mazarin,
"you are already wisdom itself, prudence personified; of your
generosity I shall not venture to speak; that which you have just
done exceeds all that the most generous men of antiquity or of
modern times have ever done."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king received this
praise coldly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So you confine yourself,"
said he, "to your thanks - and your experience, much more
extensive than my wisdom, my prudence, or my generosity, does not
furnish you with a single piece of friendly advice to guide my
future."  Mazarin reflected for a moment.  "You have just done
much for me, sire," said he, "that is, for my family."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Say no more about that,"
said the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well!" continued Mazarin,
"I shall give you something in exchange for these forty millions
you have refused so royally."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis XIV. indicated by a
movement that these flatteries were displeasing to him.  "I shall
give you a piece of advice," continued Mazarin; "yes, a piece of
advice - advice more precious than the forty millions."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My lord cardinal!"
interrupted Louis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, listen to this
advice."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am listening."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Come nearer, sire, for I am
weak! - nearer, sire, nearer!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king bent over the dying
man.  "Sire," said Mazarin, in so low a tone that the breath of
his words arrived only like a recommendation from the tomb in the
attentive ears of the king - "Sire, never have a prime
minister."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis drew back astonished. 
The advice was a confession - a treasure, in fact, was that
sincere confession of Mazarin.  The legacy of the cardinal to the
young king was composed of six words only, but those six words,
as Mazarin had said, were worth forty millions.  Louis remained
for an instant bewildered.  As for Mazarin, he appeared only to
have said something quite natural.  A little scratching was heard
along the curtains of the alcove.  Mazarin understood: "Yes,
yes!" cried he, warmly, "yes, sire, I recommend to you a wise
man, an honest man, and a clever man."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Tell me his name, my
lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "His name is yet almost
unknown, sire; it is M. Colbert, my attendant.  Oh! try him,"
added Mazarin, in an earnest voice; "all that he has predicted
has come to pass; he has a safe glance, he is never mistaken
either in things or in men - which is more surprising still. 
Sire, I owe you much, but I think I acquit myself of all towards
you in giving you M. Colbert."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So be it," said Louis,
faintly, for, as Mazarin had said, the name of Colbert was quite
unknown to him, and he thought the enthusiasm of the cardinal
partook of the delirium of a dying man.  The cardinal sank back
on his pillows.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "For the present, adieu,
sire! adieu," murmured Mazarin.  "I am tired, and I have yet a
rough journey to take before I present myself to my new Master. 
Adieu, sire!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The young king felt the
tears rise to his eyes; he bent over the dying man, already half
a corpse, and then hastily retired.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>T</span>he whole
night was passed in anguish, common to the dying man and to the
king: the dying man expected his deliverance, the king awaited
his liberty.  Louis did not go to bed.  An hour after leaving the
chamber of the cardinal, he learned that the dying man,
recovering a little strength, had insisted upon being dressed,
adorned and painted, and seeing the ambassadors.  Like Augustus,
he no doubt considered the world a great stage, and was desirous
of playing out the last act of the comedy.  Anne of Austria
reappeared no more in the cardinal's apartments; she had nothing
more to do there.  Propriety was the pretext for her absence.  On
his part, the cardinal did not ask for her: the advice the queen
had giver her son rankled in his heart.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Towards midnight, while
still painted, Mazarin's mortal agony came on.  He had revised
his will, and as this will was the exact expression of his
wishes, and as he feared that some interested influence might
take advantage of his weakness to make him change something in
it, he had given orders to Colbert, who walked up and down the
corridor which led to the cardinal's bed-chamber, like the most
vigilant of sentinels.  The king, shut up in his own apartment,
dispatched his nurse every hour to Mazarin's chamber, with orders
to bring him back an exact bulletin of the cardinal's state. 
After having heard that Mazarin was dressed, painted, and had
seen the ambassadors, Louis herd that the prayers for the dying
were being read for the cardinal.  At one o'clock in the morning,
Gu&eacute;naud had administered the last remedy.  This was a
relic of the old customs of that fencing time, which was about to
disappear to give place to another time, to believe that death
could be kept off by some good secret thrust.  Mazarin, after
having taken the remedy, respired freely for nearly ten minutes. 
He immediately gave orders that the news should be spread
everywhere of a fortunate crisis.  The king, on learning this,
felt as if a cold sweat were passing over his brow; - he had had
a glimpse of the light of liberty; slavery appeared to him more
dark and less acceptable than ever.  But the bulletin which
followed entirely changed the face of things.  Mazarin could no
longer breathe at all, and could scarcely follow the prayers
which the cur&eacute; of Saint-Nicholas-des-Champs recited near
him.  The king resumed his agitated walk about his chamber, and
consulted, as he walked, several papers drawn from a casket of
which he alone had the key.  A third time the nurse returned.  M.
de Mazarin had just uttered a joke, and had ordered his "Flora,"
by Titian, to be revarnished.  At length, towards two o'clock in
the morning, the king could no longer resist his weariness: he
had not slept for twenty-four hours.  Sleep, so powerful at his
age, overcame him for about an hour.  But he did not go to bed
for that hour; he slept in a <i>fauteuil</i>.  About four o'clock
his nurse awoke him by entering the room.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well?" asked the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, my dear sire," said
the nurse, clasping her hands with an air of commiseration. 
"Well; he is dead!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king arose at a bound,
as if a steel spring had been applied to his legs.  "Dead!" cried
he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Alas! yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is it quite certain?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Official?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Has the news been made
public?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Not yet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who told you, then, that
the cardinal was dead?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "M. Colbert."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "M. Colbert?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And he was sure of what he
said?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He came out of the chamber,
and had held a glass for some minutes before the cardinal's
lips."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah!" said the king.  "And
what is become of M. Colbert?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He has just left his
eminence's chamber."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Where is he?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He followed me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So that he is - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, waiting at your door,
till it shall be your good pleasure to receive him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis ran to the door,
opened it himself, and perceived Colbert standing waiting in the
passage.  The king started at sight of this statue, all clothed
in black.  Colbert, bowing with profound respect, advanced two
steps towards his majesty.  Louis re-entered his chamber, making
Colbert a sign to follow.  Colbert entered; Louis dismissed the
nurse, who closed the door as she went out.  Colbert remained
modestly standing near that door.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What do you come to
announce to me, monsieur?" said Louis, very much troubled at
being thus surprised in his private thoughts, which he could not
completely conceal.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That monsieur le cardinal
has just expired, sire; and that I bring your majesty his last
adieu."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king remained pensive
for a minute; and during that minute he looked attentively at
Colbert; - it was evident that the cardinal's last words were in
his mind.  "Are you, then, M. Colbert?" asked he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "His faithful servant, as
his eminence himself told me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The depositary of many of
his secrets?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Of all of them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The friends and servants of
his eminence will be dear to me, monsieur, and I shall take care
that you are well placed in my employment."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Colbert bowed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are a financier,
monsieur, I believe?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And did monsieur le
cardinal employ you in his stewardship?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I had that honor,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You never did anything
personally for my household, I believe?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Pardon me, sire, it was I
who had the honor of giving monsieur le cardinal the idea of an
economy which puts three hundred thousand francs a year into your
majesty's coffers."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What economy was that,
monsieur?" asked Louis XIV.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your majesty knows that the
hundred Swiss have silver lace on each side of their
ribbons?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Doubtless."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, sire, it was I who
proposed that imitation silver lace should be placed upon these
ribbons; it could not be detected, and a hundred thousand crowns
serve to feed a regiment during six months; and is the price of
ten thousand good muskets or the value of a vessel of ten guns,
ready for sea."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is true," said Louis
XIV., considering more attentively, "and, <i>ma foi!</i> that was
a well placed economy; besides, it was ridiculous for soldiers to
wear the same lace as noblemen."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am happy to be approved
of by your majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is that the only
appointment you held about the cardinal?" asked the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It was I who was appointed
to examine the accounts of the superintendent, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah!" said Louis, who was
about to dismiss Colbert, but whom that word stopped; "ah! it was
you whom his eminence had charged to control M. Fouquet, was it? 
And the result of that examination?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is that there is a deficit,
sire; but if your majesty will permit me - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Speak, M. Colbert."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I ought to give your
majesty some explanations."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Not at all, monsieur, it is
you who have controlled these accounts; give me the result."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is very easily done,
sire: emptiness everywhere, money nowhere."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Beware, monsieur; you are
roughly attacking the administration of M. Fouquet, who,
nevertheless, I have heard say, is an able man."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Colbert colored, and then
became pale, for he felt that from that minute he entered upon a
struggle with a man whose power almost equaled the sway of him
who had just died.  "Yes, sire, a very able man," repeated
Colbert, bowing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But if M. Fouquet is an
able man, and, in spite of that ability, if money be wanting,
whose fault is it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I do not accuse, sire, I
verify."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is well; make out your
accounts, and present them to me.  There is a deficit, you say? 
A deficit may be temporary; credit returns and funds are
restored."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Upon this year, perhaps, I
understand that; but upon next year?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Next year is eaten as bare
as the current year."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But the year after,
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Will be just like next
year."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What do you tell me,
Monsieur Colbert?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I say there are four years
engaged beforehand."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "They must have a loan,
then."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "They must have three,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I will create offices to
make them resign, and the salary of the posts shall be paid into
the treasury."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Impossible, sire, for there
have already been creations upon creations of offices, the
provisions of which are given in blank, so that the purchasers
enjoy them without filling them.  That is why your majesty cannot
make them resign.  Further, upon each agreement M. Fouquet has
made an abatement of a third, so that the people have been
plundered, without your majesty profiting by it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The king started. 
"Explain me that, M. Colbert," he said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Let your majesty
set down clearly your thought, and tell me what you wish me to
explain."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are right, clearness is
what you wish, is it not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire, clearness.  God
is God above all things, because He made light."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, for example," resumed
Louis XIV., "if to-day, the cardinal being dead, and I being
king, suppose I wanted money?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your majesty would not have
any."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! that is strange,
monsieur!  How! my superintendent would not find me any
money?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Colbert shook his large
head.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How is that?" said the
king; "is the income of the state so much in debt that there is
no longer any revenue?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king frowned and said,
"If it be so, I will get together the <i>ordonnances</i> to
obtain a discharge from the holders, a liquidation at a cheap
rate."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Impossible, for the
<i>ordonnances</i> have been converted into bills, which bills,
for the convenience of return and facility of transaction, are
divided into so many parts that the originals can no longer be
recognized."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis, very much agitated,
walked about, still frowning.  "But, if this is as you say,
Monsieur Colbert," said he, stopping all at once, "I shall be
ruined before I begin to reign."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are, in fact, sire,"
said the impassible caster-up of figures.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, but yet, monsieur,
the money is somewhere?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire, and even as a
beginning, I bring your majesty a note of funds which M. le
Cardinal Mazarin was not willing to set down in his testament,
neither in any act whatever, but which he confided to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire, with an
injunction to remit it to your majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What! besides the forty
millions of the testament?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "M. de Mazarin had still
other funds?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Colbert bowed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, that man was a gulf!"
murmured the king.  "M. de Mazarin on one side, M. Fouquet on the
other, - more than a hundred millions perhaps between them!  No
wonder my coffers should be empty!"  Colbert waited without
stirring.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And is the sum you bring me
worth the trouble?" asked the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire, it is a round
sum."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Amounting to how much?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To thirteen millions of
livres, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thirteen millions!" cried
Louis, trembling with joy; "do you say thirteen millions,
Monsieur Colbert?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I said thirteen millions,
yes, your majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Of which everybody is
ignorant?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Of which everybody is
ignorant."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Which are in your
hands?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In my hands, yes,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And which I can have?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Within two hours,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But where are they,
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In the cellar of a house
which the cardinal possessed in the city, and which he was so
kind as to leave me by a particular clause of his will."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are acquainted with the
cardinal's will, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have a duplicate of it,
signed by his hand."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A duplicate?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire, and here it
is."  Colbert drew the deed quietly from his pocket, and showed
it to the king.  The king read the article relative to the
donation of the house.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But," said he, "there is no
question here but of the house; there is nothing said of the
money."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your pardon, sire, it is in
my conscience."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And Monsieur Mazarin has
intrusted it to you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why not, sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He! a man mistrustful of
everybody?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He was not so of me, sire,
as your majesty may perceive."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis fixed his eyes with
admiration upon that vulgar but expressive face.  "You are an
honest man, M. Colbert," said the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is not a virtue, it is
a duty," replied Colbert, coolly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But," added Louis, "does
not the money belong to the family?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "If this money belonged to
the family it would be disposed of in the testament, as the rest
of the fortune is.  If this money belonged to the family, I, who
drew up the deed of donation in favor of your majesty, should
have added the sum of thirteen millions to that of forty millions
which was offered to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How!" exclaimed Louis XIV.,
"was it you who drew up the deed of donation?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And yet the cardinal was
attached to you?" added the king, ingenuously.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I had assured his eminence
you would by no means accept the gift," said Colbert, in that
same quiet manner we have described, and which, even in the
common habits of life, had something solemn in it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis passed his hand over
his brow: "Oh! how young I am," murmured he, "to have command of
men."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Colbert waited the end of
this monologue.  He saw Louis raise his head.  "At what hour
shall I send the money to your majesty?" asked he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To-night, at eleven
o'clock; I desire that no one may know that I possess this
money."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Colbert made no more reply
than if the thing had not been said to him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is the amount in ingots, or
coined gold?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In coined gold, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is well."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Where shall I send it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To the Louvre.  Thank you,
M. Colbert."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Colbert bowed and retired. 
"Thirteen millions!" exclaimed Louis, as soon as he was alone. 
"This must be a dream!"  Then he allowed his head to sink between
his hands, as if he were really asleep.  But, at the end of a
moment, he arose, and opening the window violently, he bathed his
burning brow in the keen morning air, which brought to his senses
the scent of the trees, and the perfume of the flowers.  A
splendid dawn was gilding the horizon, and the first rays of the
sun bathed in flame the young king's brow.  "This is the dawn of
my reign," murmured Louis XIV.  "It's a presage sent by the
Almighty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>I</span>n the
morning, the news of the death of the cardinal was spread through
the castle, and thence speedily reached the city.  The ministers
Fouquet, Lyonne, and Letellier entered <i>la salle des
s&eacute;ances</i>, to hold a council.  The king sent for them
immediately.  "Messieurs," said he," as long as monsieur le
cardinal lived, I allowed him to govern my affairs; but now I
mean to govern them myself.  You will give me your advice when I
ask it.  You may go."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The ministers looked at each
other with surprise.  If they concealed a smile it was with a
great effort, for they knew that the prince, brought up in
absolute ignorance of business, by this took upon himself a
burden much too heavy for his strength.  Fouquet took leave of
his colleagues upon the stairs, saying: - "Messieurs! there will
be so much the less labor for us."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                And he climbed gayly into
his carriage.  The others, a little uneasy at the turn things had
taken, went back to Paris together.  Towards ten o'clock the king
repaired to the apartment of his mother, with whom he had a long
and private conversation.  After dinner, he got into his
carriage, and went straight to the Louvre.  There he received
much company, and took a degree of pleasure in remarking the
hesitation of each, and the curiosity of all.  Towards evening he
ordered the doors of the Louvre to be closed, with the exception
of only one, which opened on the quay.  He placed on duty at this
point two hundred Swiss, who did not speak a word of French, with
orders to admit all who carried packages, but no others; and by
no means to allow any one to go out.  At eleven o'clock
precisely, he heard the rolling of a heavy carriage under the
arch, then of another, then of a third; after which the gate
grated upon its hinges to be closed.  Soon after, somebody
scratched with his nail at the door of the cabinet.  The king
opened it himself, and beheld Colbert, whose first word was this:
- "The money is in your majesty's cellar."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king then descended and
went himself to see the barrels of specie, in gold and silver,
which, under the direction of Colbert, four men had just rolled
into a cellar of which the king had given Colbert the key in the
morning.  This review completed, Louis returned to his
apartments, followed by Colbert, who had not apparently warmed
with one ray of personal satisfaction.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," said the king,
"what do you wish that I should give you, as a recompense for
this devotedness and probity?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Absolutely nothing,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How! nothing?  Not even an
opportunity of serving me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "If your majesty were not to
furnish me with that opportunity, I should not the less serve
you.  It is impossible for me not to be the best servant of the
king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You shall be intendant of
the finances, M. Colbert."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But there is already a
superintendent, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I know that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, the superintendent of
the finances is the most powerful man in the kingdom."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah!" cried Louis, coloring,
"do you think so?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He will crush me in a week,
sire.  Your majesty gives me a <i>contr&ocirc;le</i> for which
strength is indispensable.  An intendant under a superintendent,
- that is inferiority."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You want support - you do
not reckon upon me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I had the honor of telling
your majesty, that during the lifetime of M. de Mazarin, M.
Fouquet was the second man in the kingdom; now M. de Mazarin is
dead, M. Fouquet is become the first."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, I agree to what
you told me of all things up to to-day; but to-morrow, please to
remember, I shall no longer suffer it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then I shall be of no use
to your majesty?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are already, since you
fear to compromise yourself in serving me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I only fear to be placed so
that I cannot serve your majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What do you wish,
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I wish your majesty to
allow me assistance in the labors of the office of
intendant."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That post would lose its
value."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It would gain in
security."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Choose your
colleagues."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Messieurs Breteuil, Marin,
Hervart."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To-morrow the
<i>ordonnance</i> shall appear."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, I thank you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is that all you ask?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, sire, one thing
more."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What is that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Allow me to compose a
chamber of justice."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What would this chamber of
justice do?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Try the farmers-general and
contractors, who, during ten years, have been robbing the
state."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, but what would you do
with them?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Hang two or three, and that
would make the rest disgorge."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I cannot commence my reign
with executions, Monsieur Colbert."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "On the contrary, sire, you
had better, in order not to have to end with them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king made no reply. 
"Does your majesty consent?" said Colbert.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I will reflect upon it,
monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It will be too late when
reflection may be made."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Because you have to deal
with people stronger than ourselves, if they are warned."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Compose that chamber of
justice, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I will, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is that all?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, sire; there is still
another important affair.  What rights does your majesty attach
to this office of intendant?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well - I do not know - the
customary ones."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, I desire that this
office be invested with the right of reading the correspondence
with England."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Impossible, monsieur, for
that correspondence is kept from the council; monsieur le
cardinal himself carried it on."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I thought your majesty had
this morning declared that there should no longer be a
council?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, I said so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Let your majesty then have
the goodness to read all the letters yourself, particularly those
from England; I hold strongly to this article."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, you shall have
that correspondence, and render me an account of it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Now, sire, what shall I do
with respect to the finances?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Everything M. Fouquet has
<i>not</i> done."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is all I ask of your
majesty.  Thanks, sire, I depart in peace;" and at these words he
took his leave.  Louis watched his departure.  Colbert was not
yet a hundred paces from the Louvre when the king received a
courier from England.  After having looked at and examined the
envelope, the king broke the seal precipitately, and found a
letter from Charles II.  The following is what the English prince
wrote to his royal brother: -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your majesty must be
rendered very uneasy by the illness of M. le Cardinal Mazarin;
but the excess of danger can only prove of service to you.  The
cardinal is given over by his physician.  I thank you for the
gracious reply you have made to my communication touching the
Princess Henrietta, my sister, and, in a week, the princess and
her court will set out for Paris.  It is gratifying to me to
acknowledge the fraternal friendship you have evinced towards me,
and to call you, more justly than ever, my brother.  It is
gratifying to me, above everything, to prove to your majesty how
much I am interested in all that may please you.  You are wrong
in having Belle-&Icirc;le-en-Mer secretly fortified.  That is
wrong.  We shall never be at war against each other.  That
measure does not make me uneasy, it makes me sad.  You are
spending useless millions; tell your ministers so; and rest
assured that I am well informed; render me the same service, my
brother, if occasion offers."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king rang his bell
violently, and his <i>valet de chambre</i> appeared.  "Monsieur
Colbert is just gone; he cannot be far off.  Let him be called
back!" exclaimed he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The valet was about to
execute the order, when the king stopped him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No," said he, "no; I see
the whole scheme of that man.  Belle-Isle belongs to M. Fouquet;
Belle-Isle is being fortified: that is a conspiracy on the part
of M. Fouquet.  The discovery of that conspiracy is the ruin of
the superintendent, and that discovery is the result of the
correspondence with England: this is why Colbert wished to have
that correspondence.  Oh! but I cannot place all my dependence
upon that man; he has a good head, but I must have an arm!" 
Louis, all at once, uttered a joyful cry.  "I had," said he, "a
lieutenant of musketeers!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire - Monsieur
d'Artagnan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He quitted the service for
a time."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Let him be found, and be
here to-morrow the first thing in the morning."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The <i>valet de chambre</i>
bowed and went out.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thirteen millions in my
cellar," said the king; "Colbert carrying my purse and D'Artagnan
my sword - <i>I am king</i>."</p>

'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>T</span>he day of his
arrival, on returning from the Palais Royal, Athos, as we have
seen, went straight to his hotel in the Rue Saint-Honor&eacute;. 
He there found the Vicomte de Bragelonne waiting for him in his
chamber, chatting with Grimaud.  It was not an easy thing to talk
with this old servant.  Two men only possessed the secret, Athos
and D'Artagnan.  The first succeeded, because Grimaud sought to
make him speak himself; D'Artagnan, on the contrary, because he
knew how to make Grimaud talk.  Raoul was occupied in making him
describe the voyage to England, and Grimaud had related it in all
its details, with a limited number of gestures and eight words,
neither more nor less.  He had, at first, indicated by an
undulating movement of his hand, that his master and he had
crossed the sea.  "Upon some expedition?" Raoul had asked.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Grimaud by bending down his
head had answered, "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "When monsieur le comte
incurred much danger?" asked Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Neither too much nor too
little," was replied by a shrug of the shoulders.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But still, what sort of
danger?" insisted Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Grimaud pointed to the
sword; he pointed to the fire and to a musket that was hanging on
the wall.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur le comte had an
enemy there, then?" cried Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monk," replied Grimaud.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is strange," continued
Raoul, "that monsieur le comte persists in considering me a
novice, and not allowing me to partake the honor and danger of
his adventure."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Grimaud smiled.  It was at
this moment Athos came in.  The host was lighting him up the
stairs, and Grimaud, recognizing the step of his master, hastened
to meet him, which cut short the conversation.  But Raoul was
launched on the sea of interrogatories, and did not stop.  Taking
both hands of the comte, with warm, but respectful tenderness, -
"How is it, monsieur," said he, "that you have set out upon a
dangerous voyage without bidding me adieu, without commanding the
aid of my sword, of myself, who ought to be your support, now I
have the strength; whom you have brought up like a man?  Ah!
monsieur, can you expose me to the cruel trial of never seeing
you again?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who told you, Raoul," said
the comte, placing his cloak and hat in the hands of Grimaud, who
had unbuckled his sword, "who told you that my voyage was a
dangerous one?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I," said Grimaud.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And why did you do so?"
said Athos, sternly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Grimaud was embarrassed;
Raoul came to his assistance, by answering for him.  "It is
natural, monsieur, that our good Grimaud should tell me the truth
in what concerns you.  By whom should you be loved an supported,
if not by me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos did not reply.  He
made a friendly motion to Grimaud, which sent him out of the
room; he then seated himself in a <i>fauteuil</i>, whilst Raoul
remained standing before him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But it is true," continued
Raoul, "that your voyage was an expedition, and that steel and
fire threatened you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Say no more about that,
vicomte," said Athos, mildly.  "I set out hastily, it is true:
but the service of King Charles II. required a prompt departure. 
As to your anxiety, I thank you for it, and I know that I can
depend on you.  You have not wanted for anything, vicomte, in my
absence, have you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, monsieur, thank
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I left orders with Blaisois
to pay you a hundred pistoles, if you should stand in need of
money."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, I have not seen
Blaisois."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You have been without
money, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, I had thirty
pistoles left from the sale of the horses I took in my last
campaign, and M. le Prince had the kindness to allow me to win
two hundred pistoles at his play-table three months ago."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do you play?  I don't like
that, Raoul."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I never play, monsieur; it
was M. le Prince who ordered me to hold his cards at Chantilly -
one night when a courier came to him from the king.  I won, and
M. le Prince commanded me to take the stakes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is that a practice in the
household, Raoul?" asked Athos with a frown.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur; every week
M. le Prince affords, upon one occasion or another, a similar
advantage to one of his gentlemen.  There are fifty gentlemen in
his highness's household; it was my turn."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very well!  You went into
Spain, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur, I made a
very delightful and interesting journey."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You have been back a month,
have you not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And in the course of that
month?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In that month - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What have you done?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My duty, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Have you not been home, to
La F&egrave;re?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Raoul colored.  Athos looked
at him with a fixed but tranquil expression.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You would be wrong not to
believe me," said Raoul.  "I feel that I colored, and in spite of
myself.  The question you did me the honor to ask me is of a
nature to raise in me much emotion.  I color, then, because I am
agitated, not because I meditate a falsehood."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I know, Raoul, you never
lie."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Besides, my young friend,
you would be wrong; what I wanted to say - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I know quite well,
monsieur.  You would ask me if I have not been to Blois?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Exactly so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have not been there; I
have not even seen the person to whom you allude."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Raoul's voice trembled as he
pronounced these words.  Athos, a sovereign judge in all matters
of delicacy, immediately added, "Raoul, you answer me with a
painful feeling; you are unhappy."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very, monsieur; you have
forbidden me to go to Blois, or to see Mademoiselle de la
Valli&egrave;re again."  Here the young man stopped.  That dear
name, so delightful to pronounce, made his heart bleed, although
so sweet upon his lips.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And I have acted rightly,
Raoul." Athos hastened to reply.  "I am neither an unjust nor a
barbarous father; I respect true love; but I look forward for you
to a future - an immense future.  A new reign is about to break
upon us like a fresh dawn.  War calls upon a young king full of
chivalric spirit.  What is wanting to assist this heroic ardor is
a battalion of young and free lieutenants who would rush to the
fight with enthusiasm, and fall, crying: '<i>Vive le Roi!</i>'
instead of 'Adieu, my dear wife.'  You understand that, Raoul. 
However brutal my reasoning may appear, I conjure you, then, to
believe me, and to turn away your thoughts from those early days
of youth in which you took up this habit of love - days of
effeminate carelessness, which soften the heart and render it
incapable of consuming those strong bitter draughts called glory
and adversity.  Therefore,  Raoul, I repeat to you, you should
see in my counsel only the desire of being useful to you, only
the ambition of seeing you prosper.  I believe you capable of
becoming a remarkable man.  March alone, and you will march
better, and more quickly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You have commanded,
monsieur," replied Raoul, "and I obey."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Commanded!" cried Athos. 
"Is it thus you reply to me?  I have commanded you!  Oh! you
distort my words as you misconceive my intentions.  I do not
command you; I request you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, monsieur, you have
commanded," said Raoul, persistently; "had you requested me, your
request is even more effective than your order.  I have not seen
Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re again."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But you are unhappy! you
are unhappy!" insisted Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Raoul made no reply.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I find you pale; I find you
dull.  The sentiment is strong, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is a passion," replied
Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No - a habit."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, you know I have
traveled much, that I have passed two years far away from her.  A
habit would yield to an absence of two years, I believe; whereas,
on my return, I loved not more, that was impossible, but as
much.  Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re is for me the one lady
above all others; but you are for me a god upon earth - to you I
sacrifice everything."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are wrong," said Athos;
"I have no longer any right over you.  Age has emancipated you;
you no longer even stand in need of my consent.  Besides, I will
not refuse my consent after what you have told me.  Marry
Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re, if you like."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Raoul was startled, but
suddenly: "You are very kind, monsieur," said he; "and your
concession excites my warmest gratitude, but I will not accept
it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then you now refuse?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I will not oppose you in
anything, Raoul."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But you have at the bottom
of your heart an idea against this marriage: it is not your
choice."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is true."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is sufficient to make
me resist: I will wait."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Beware, Raoul!  What you
are now saying is serious."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I know it is, monsieur; as
I said, I will wait."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Until I die?" said Athos,
much agitated.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! monsieur," cried Raoul,
with tears in his eyes, "is it possible that you should wound my
heart thus?  I have never given you cause of complaint!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Dear boy, that is true,"
murmured Athos, pressing his lips violently together to conceal
the emotion of which he was no longer master.  "No, I will no
longer afflict you; only I do not comprehend what you mean by
waiting.  Will you wait till you love no longer?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! for that! - no,
monsieur.  I will wait till you change your opinion."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I should wish to put the
matter to a test, Raoul; I should like to see if Mademoiselle de
la Valli&egrave;re will wait as you do."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I hope so, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But, take care, Raoul!
suppose she did not wait?  Ah, you are young, so confiding, so
loyal!  Women are changeable."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You have never spoken ill
to me of women, monsieur; you have never had to complain of them;
why should you doubt of Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is true," said Athos,
casting down his eyes; "I have never spoken ill to you of women;
I have never had to complain of them; Mademoiselle de la
Valli&egrave;re never gave birth to a suspicion; but when we are
looking forward, we must go even to exceptions, even to
improbabilities!  <i>If</i>, I say, Mademoiselle de la
Valli&egrave;re should not wait for you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How, monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "If she turned her eyes
another way."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "If she looked favorably
upon another, do you mean, monsieur?" said Raoul, pale with
agony.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Exactly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, monsieur, I would
kill him," said Raoul, simply, "and all the men whom Mademoiselle
de la Valli&egrave;re should choose, until one of them had killed
me, or Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re had restored me her
heart."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos started.  "I thought,"
resumed he, in an agitated voice, "that you called my just now
your god, your law in this world."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!" said Raoul, trembling,
"you would forbid me the duel?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Suppose I <i>did</i> forbid
it, Raoul?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You would not forbid me to
hope, monsieur; consequently you would not forbid me to die."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Athos raised his eyes toward
the vicomte.  He had pronounced these words with the most
melancholy look.  "Enough," said Athos, after a long silence,
"enough of this subject, upon which we both go too far.  Live as
well as you are able, Raoul, perform your duties, love
Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re; in a word, act like a man,
since you have attained the age of a man; only do not forget that
I love you tenderly, and that you profess to love me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! monsieur le comte!"
cried Raoul, pressing the hand of Athos to his heart.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Enough, dear boy, leave me;
I want rest.  <i>A propos</i>, M. d'Artagnan has returned from
England with me; you owe him a visit."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I will pay it, monsieur,
with great pleasure.  I love Monsieur d'Artagnan
exceedingly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are right in doing so;
he is a worthy man and a brave cavalier."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who loves you dearly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am sure of that.  Do you
know his address?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "At the Louvre, I suppose,
or wherever the king is.  Does he not command the
musketeers?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No; at present M.
d'Artagnan is absent on leave; he is resting for awhile.  Do not,
therefore, seek him at the posts of his service.  You will hear
of him at the house of a certain Planchet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "His former lackey?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Exactly; turned
grocer."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I know; Rue des
Lombards?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Somewhere thereabouts, or
Rue des Arcis."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I will find it, monsieur -
I will find it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You will say a thousand
kind things to him, on my part, and ask him to come and dine with
me before I set out for La F&egrave;re."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good-might, Raoul!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, I see you wear an
order I never saw you wear before; accept my compliments."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The Fleece! - that is
true.  A bauble, my boy, which no longer amuses an old child like
myself.  Good-night, Raoul!"</p>

'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>R</span>aoul did not
meet with D'Artagnan the next day, as he had hoped.  He only met
with Planchet, whose joy was great at seeing the young man again,
and who contrived to pay him two or three little soldierly
compliments, savoring very little of the grocer's shop.  But as
Raoul was returning the next day from Vincennes at the head of
fifty dragoons confided to him by Monsieur le Prince, he
perceived, in La Place Baudoyer, a man with his nose in the air,
examining a house as we examine a horse we have a fancy to buy. 
This man, dressed in a citizen costume buttoned up like a
military <i>pourpoint</i>, a very small hat on his head, but a
long shagreen-mounted sword by his side, turned his head as soon
as he heard the steps of the horses, and left off looking at the
house to look at the dragoons.  It was simply M. d'Artagnan;
D'Artagnan on foot; D'Artagnan with his hands behind him, passing
a little review upon the dragoons, after having reviewed the
buildings.  Not a man, not a tag, not a horse's hoof escaped his
inspection.  Raoul rode at the side of his troop; D'Artagnan
perceived him the last.  "Eh!" said he, "Eh! 
<i>Mordioux!</i>"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I was not mistaken!" cried
Raoul, turning his horse towards him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Mistaken - no!  Good-day to
you," replied the ex-musketeer; whilst Raoul eagerly pressed the
hand of his old friend.  "Take care, Raoul," said D'Artagnan,
"the second horse of the fifth rank will lose a shoe before he
gets to the Pont Marie; he has only two nails left in his off
fore-foot."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Wait a minute, I will come
back," said Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Can you quit your
detachment?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The cornet is there to take
my place."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then you will come and dine
with me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Most willingly, Monsieur
d'Artagnan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Be quick, then; leave your
horse, or make them give me one."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I prefer coming back on
foot with you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Raoul hastened to give
notice to the cornet, who took his post; he then dismounted, gave
his horse to one of the dragoons, and with great delight seized
the arm of M. d'Artagnan, who had watched him during all these
little evolutions with the satisfaction of a connoisseur.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What, do you come from
Vincennes?" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur le
chevalier."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And the cardinal?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is very ill; it is even
reported he is dead."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Are you on good terms with
M. Fouquet?" asked D'Artagnan, with a disdainful movement of the
shoulders, proving that the death of Mazarin did not affect him
beyond measure.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "With M. Fouquet?" said
Raoul; "I do not know him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So much the worse! so much
the worse! for a new king always seeks to get good men in his
employment."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! the king means no
harm," replied the young man.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I say nothing about the
crown," cried D'Artagnan; "I am speaking of the king - the king,
that is M. Fouquet, if the cardinal is dead.  You must contrive
to stand well with M. Fouquet, if you do not wish to molder away
all your life as I have moldered.  It is true you have,
fortunately, other protectors."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "M. le Prince, for
instance."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Worn out! worn out!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "M. le Comte de la
F&egrave;re?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Athos!  Oh! that's
different; yes, Athos - and if you have any wish to make your way
in England, you cannot apply to a better person; I can even say,
without too much vanity, that I myself have some credit at the
court of Charles II.  There is a king - God speed him!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah!" cried Raoul, with the
natural curiosity of well-born young people, while listening to
experience and courage.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, a king who amuses
himself, it is true, but who has had a sword in his hand, and can
appreciate useful men.  Athos is on good terms with Charles II. 
Take service there, and leave these scoundrels of contractors and
farmers-general, who steal as well with French hands as others
have done with Italian hands; leave the little snivelling king,
who is going to give us another reign of Francis II.  Do you know
anything of history, Raoul?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur le
chevalier."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do you know, then, that
Francis II. had always the earache?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, I did not know
that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That Charles IV. had always
the headache?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Indeed!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And Henry III. had always
the stomach-ache?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Raoul began to laugh.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, my dear friend, Louis
XIV. always has the heart-ache; it is deplorable to see a king
sighing from morning till night without saying once in the course
of the day, <i>ventre-saint-gris!  corb&oelig;f!</i> or anything
to rouse one."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Was that the reason why you
quitted the service, monsieur le chevalier?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But you yourself, M.
d'Artagnan, are throwing the handle after the axe; you will not
make a fortune."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who?  I?" replied
D'Artagnan, in a careless tone; "I am settled - I had some family
property."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Raoul looked at him.  The
poverty of D'Artagnan was proverbial.  A Gascon, he exceeded in
ill-luck all the gasconnades of France and Navarre; Raoul had a
hundred times heard Job and D'Artagnan named together, as the
twins Romulus and Remus.  D'Artagnan caught Raoul's look of
astonishment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And has not your father
told you I have been in England?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur le
chevalier."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And that I there met with a
very lucky chance?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, monsieur, I did not
know that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, a very worthy friend
of mine, a great nobleman, the viceroy of Scotland and Ireland,
has endowed me with an inheritance."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "An inheritance?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And a good one, too."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then you are rich?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bah!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Receive my sincere
congratulation."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thank you!  Look, that is
my house."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Place de Gr&egrave;ve?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes; don't you like this
quarter?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "On the contrary, the
look-out over the water is pleasant.  Oh! what a pretty old
house!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The sign Notre Dame; it is
an old <i>cabaret</i>, which I have transformed into a private
house in two days."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But the <i>cabaret</i> is
still open?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Pardieu!</i>"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And where do you lodge,
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I?  I lodge with
Planchet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You said, just now, 'This
is my house.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I said so, because, in
fact, it is my house.  I have bought it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah!" said Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "At ten years' purchase, my
dear Raoul; a superb affair; I bought the house for thirty
thousand livres; it has a garden which opens to the Rue de la
Mortillerie; the <i>cabaret</i> lets for a thousand livres, with
the first story; the garret, or second floor, for five hundred
livres."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Indeed!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, indeed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Five hundred livres for a
garret?  Why, it is not habitable."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Therefore no one inhabits
it; only, you see, this garret has two windows which look out
upon the Place."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, then, every time
anybody is broken on the wheel or hung, quartered, or burnt,
these two windows let for twenty pistoles."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!" said Raoul, with
horror.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is disgusting, is it
not?" said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!" repeated Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is disgusting, but so it
is.  These Parisian cockneys are sometimes real anthropophagi.  I
cannot conceive how men, Christians, can make such
speculation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is true."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "As for myself," continued
D'Artagnan, "if I inhabited that house, on days of execution I
would shut it up to the very keyholes; but I do not inhabit
it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you let the garret for
five hundred livres?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To the ferocious
<i>cabaretier</i>, who sub-lets it.  I said, then, fifteen
hundred livres."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The natural interest of
money," said Raoul, - "five per cent."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Exactly so.  I then have
left the side of the house at the back, store-rooms, and cellars,
inundated every winter, two hundred livres; and the garden, which
is very fine, well planted, well shaded under the walls and the
portal of Saint-Gervais-Saint-Protais, thirteen hundred
livres."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thirteen hundred livres!
why, that is royal!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This is the whole history. 
I strongly suspect some canon of the parish (these canons are all
rich as Cr&oelig;sus) - I suspect some canon of having hired the
garden to take his pleasure in.  The tenant has given the name of
M. Godard.  That is either a false name or a real name; if true,
he is a canon; if false, he is some unknown; but of what
consequence is it to me? he always pays in advance.  I had also
an idea just now, when I met you, of buying a house in the Place
Baudoyer, the back premises of which join my garden, and would
make a magnificent property.  Your dragoons interrupted my
calculations.  But come, let us take the Rue de la Vannerie: that
will lead us straight to M. Planchet's."  D'Artagnan mended his
pace, and conducted Raoul to Planchet's dwelling, a chamber of
which the grocer had given up to his old master.  Planchet was
out, but the dinner was ready.  There was a remains of military
regularity and punctuality preserved in the grocer's household. 
D'Artagnan returned to the subject of Raoul's future.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your father brings you up
rather strictly?" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Justly, monsieur le
chevalier."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, yes, I know Athos is
just; but close, perhaps?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A royal hand, Monsieur
d'Artagnan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, never want, my boy! 
If ever you stand in need of a few pistoles, the old musketeer is
at hand."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My dear Monsieur
d'Artagnan!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do you play a little?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Never."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Successful with the ladies,
then? - Oh! my little Aramis!  That, my dear friend, costs even
more than play.  It is true we fight when we lose; that is a
compensation.  Bah! that little sniveller, the king, makes
winners give him his revenge.  What a reign! my poor Raoul, what
a reign!  When we think that, in my time, the musketeers were
besieged in their houses like Hector and Priam in the city of
Troy; and the women wept, and then the walls laughed, and then
five hundred beggarly fellows clapped their hands and cried,
'Kill! kill!' when not one musketeer was hurt.  <i>Mordioux!</i>
you will never see anything like <i>that</i>."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are very hard upon the
king, my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan and yet you scarcely know
him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I!  Listen, Raoul.  Day by
day, hour by hour, - take note of my words, - I will predict what
he will do.  The cardinal being dead, he will fret; very well,
that is the least silly thing he will do, particularly if he does
not shed a tear."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, then he will get M.
Fouquet to allow him a pension, and will go and compose verses at
Fontainebleau, upon some Mancini or other, whose eyes the queen
will scratch out.  She is a Spaniard, you see, - this queen of
ours; and she has, for mother-in-law, Madame Anne of Austria.  I
know something of the Spaniards of the house of Austria."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And next?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, after having torn the
silver lace from the uniforms of his Swiss, because lace is too
expensive, he will dismount his musketeers, because oats and hay
of a horse cost five sols a day."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! do not say that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Of what consequence is it
to <i>me?</i> I am no longer a musketeer, am I?  Let them be on
horseback, let them be on foot, let them carry a larding-pin, a
spit, a sword, or nothing - what is it to <i>me?</i>"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My dear Monsieur
d'Artagnan, I beseech you speak no more ill of the king.  I am
almost in his service, and my father would be very angry with me
for having heard, even from your mouth, words injurious to his
majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your father, eh!  He is a
knight in every bad cause.  <i>Pardieu!</i> yes, your father is a
brave man, a C&aelig;sar, it is true - but a man without
perception."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Now, my dear chevalier,"
exclaimed Raoul, laughing, "are you going to speak ill of my
father, of him you call the great Athos?  Truly you are in a bad
vein to-day; riches render you as sour as poverty renders other
people."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Pardieu!</i> you are
right.  I am a rascal and in my dotage; I am an unhappy wretch
grown old; a tent-cord untwisted, a pierced cuirass, a boot
without a sole, a spur without a rowel ; - but do me the pleasure
to add one thing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What is that, my dear
Monsieur d'Artagnan?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Simply say: 'Mazarin was a
pitiful wretch.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Perhaps he is dead."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "More the reason - I say
<i>was</i>; if I did not hope that he was dead, I would entreat
you to say: 'Mazarin <i>is</i> a pitiful wretch.'  Come, say so,
say so, for love of me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, I will."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Say it!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Mazarin was a pitiful
wretch," said Raoul, smiling at the musketeer, who roared with
laughter, as in his best days.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A moment," said the latter;
"you have spoken my first proposition, here is the conclusion of
it, - repeat, Raoul, repeat: 'But I regret Mazarin.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Chevalier!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You will not say it?  Well,
then, I will say it twice for you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But you would regret
Mazarin?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                And they were still laughing
and discussing this profession of principles, when one of the
shop-boys entered.  "A letter, monsieur," said he, "for M.
d'Artagnan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thank you; give it me,"
cried the musketeer,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The handwriting of monsieur
le comte," said Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, yes."  And D'Artagnan
broke the seal.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Dear friend," said Athos,
"a person has just been here to beg me to seek for you, on the
part of the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Seek me!" said D'Artagnan,
letting the paper fall upon the table.  Raoul picked it up, and
continued to read aloud: -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Make haste.  His majesty is
very anxious to speak to you, and expects you at the Louvre."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Expects me?" again repeated
the musketeer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He, he, he!" laughed
Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, oh!" replied
D'Artagnan.  "What the devil can this mean?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=

moment of surprise over, D'Artagnan reperused Athos's note.  "It
is strange," said he, "that the king should send for me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why so?" said Raoul; "do
you not think, monsieur, that the king must regret such a servant
as you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, oh!" cried the officer,
laughing with all his might; "you are poking fun at me, Master
Raoul.  If the king had regretted me, he would not have let me
leave him.  No, no; I see in it something better, or worse, if
you like."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Worse!  What can that be,
monsieur le chevalier?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are young, you are a
boy, you are admirable.  Oh, how I should like to be as you are! 
To be but twenty-four, with an unfortunate brow, under which the
brain is void of everything but women, love, and good
intentions.  Oh, Raoul, as long as you have not received the
smiles of kings, the confidence of queens; as long as you have
not had two cardinals killed under you, the one a tiger, the
other a fox; as long as you have not - But what is the good of
all this trifling?  We must part, Raoul."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How you say the word!  What
a serious face!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eh! but the occasion is
worthy of it.  Listen to me.  I have a very good recommendation
to tender you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am all attention,
Monsieur d'Artagnan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You will go and inform your
father of my departure."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your departure?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Pardieu!</i>  You will
tell him I am gone into England; and that I am living in my
little country-house."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In England, you! - And the
king's orders?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You get more and more
silly: do you imagine that I am going to the Louvre, to place
myself at the disposal of that little crowned wolf-cub?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The king a wolf-cub?  Why,
monsieur le chevalier, you are mad!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "On the contrary, I never
was so sane.  You do not know what he wants to do with me, this
worthy son of <i>Louis le Juste!</i> - But, <i>mordioux!</i> that
is policy.  He wishes to ensconce me snugly in the Bastile -
purely and simply, look you!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What for?" cried Raoul,
terrified at what he heard.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "On account of what I told
him one day at Blois.  I was warm; he remembers it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You told him what?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That he was mean, cowardly,
and silly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good God!" cried Raoul, "is
it possible that such words should have issued from your
mouth?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Perhaps I don't give the
letter of my speech, but I give the sense of it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But did not the king have
you arrested immediately?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "By whom?  It was I who
commanded the musketeers; he must have commanded me to convey
myself to prison; I would never have consented: I would have
resisted myself.  And then I went into England - no more
D'Artagnan.  Now, the cardinal is dead, or nearly so, they learn
that I am in Paris, and they lay their hands on me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The cardinal was your
protector?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The cardinal knew me; he
knew certain particularities of me; I also knew some of his; we
appreciated each other mutually.  And then, on rendering his soul
to the devil, he would recommend Anne of Austria to make me the
inhabitant of a safe place.  Go, then, and find your father,
relate the fact to him - and adieu!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My dear Monsieur
d'Artagnan," said Raoul, very much agitated, after having looked
out the window, "you cannot even fly!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Because there is below an
officer of the Swiss guards waiting for you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, he will arrest
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan broke into a
Homeric laugh.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!  I know very well that
you will resist, that you will fight, even; I know very well that
you will prove the conqueror; but that amounts to rebellion, and
you are an officer yourself, knowing what discipline is."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Devil of a boy, how logical
that is!" grumbled D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You approve of it, do you
not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, instead of passing
into the street, where that idiot is waiting for me, I will slip
quietly out at the back.  I have a horse in the stable, and a
good one.  I will ride him to death; my means permit me to do so,
and by killing one horse after another, I shall arrive at
Boulogne in eleven hours; I know the road.  Only tell your father
one thing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What is that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is - that the thing he
knows about is placed at Planchet's house, except a fifth, and
that - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But, my dear D'Artagnan,
rest assured that if you fly, two things will be said of
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What are they, my dear
friend?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The first, that you have
been afraid."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! and who will dare to
say that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The king first."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well! but he will tell the
truth, - I am afraid."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The second, that you knew
yourself guilty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Guilty of what?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, of the crimes they
wish to impute to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is true again.  So,
then, you advise me to go and get myself made a prisoner in the
Bastile?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "M. le Comte de la
F&egrave;re would advise you just as I do."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Pardieu!</i>  I know he
would," said D'Artagnan thoughtfully.  "You are right, I shall
not escape.  But if they cast me into the Bastile?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "We will get you out again,"
said Raoul, with a quiet, calm air.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Mordioux!</i>  You said
that after a brave fashion, Raoul," said D'Artagnan, seizing his
hand; "that savors of Athos, distinctly.  Well, I will go, then. 
Do not forget my last word."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Except a fifth," said
Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, you are a fine boy!
and I wish you to add one thing to that last word."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Speak, chevalier!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is that if you cannot
get me out of the Bastile, and I remain there - Oh! that will be
so, and I shall be a detestable prisoner; I, who have been a
passable man, - in that case, I give three-fifths to you, and the
fourth to your father."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Chevalier!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Mordioux!</i>  If you
will have some masses said for me, you are welcome."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                That being said, D'Artagnan
took his belt from the hook, girded on his sword, took a hat the
feather of which was fresh, and held his hand out to Raoul, who
threw himself into his arms.  When in the shop, he cast a quick
glance at the shop-lads, who looked upon the scene with a pride
mingled with some inquietude; then plunging his hands into a
chest of currants, he went straight to the officer who was
waiting for him at the door.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Those features!  Can it be
you, Monsieur de Friedisch?" cried D'Artagnan, gayly.  "Eh! eh!
what, do we arrest our friends?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Arrest!" whispered the lads
among themselves.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ja, it is I, Monsieur
d'Artagnan!  Good-day to you!" said the Swiss, in his mountain
<i>patois</i>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Must I give you up my
sword?  I warn you that it is long and heavy; you had better let
me wear if to the Louvre: I feel quite lost in the streets
without a sword, and you would be more at a loss that I should,
with two."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The king has given me no
orders about it," replied the Swiss, "so keep your sword."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, that is very polite
on the part of the king.  Let us go, at once."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monsieur Friedisch was not a
talker, and D'Artagnan had too many things to think about to say
much.  From Planchet's shop to the Louvre was not far, - they
arrived in ten minutes.  It was a dark night.  M. de Friedisch
wanted to enter by the wicket.  "No," said D'Artagnan, "you would
lose time by that; take the little staircase."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The Swiss did as D'Artagnan
advised, and conducted him to the vestibule of the king's
cabinet.  When arrived there, he bowed to his prisoner, and,
without saying anything, returned to his post.  D'Artagnan had
not had time to ask why his sword was not taken from him, when
the door of the cabinet opened, and a <i>valet de chambre</i>
called, "M. d'Artagnan!"  The musketeer assumed his parade
carriage, and entered, with his large eyes wide open, his brow
calm, his moustache stiff.  The king was seated at a table
writing.  He did not disturb himself when the step of the
musketeer resounded on the floor; he did not even turn his head. 
D'Artagnan advanced as far as the middle of the room, and seeing
that the king paid no attention to him, and suspecting, besides,
that this was nothing but affectation, a sort of tormenting
preamble to the explanation that was preparing, he turned his
back on the prince, and began to examine the frescoes on the
cornices, and the cracks in the ceiling.  This maneuver was
accompanied by a little tacit monologue.  "Ah! you want to humble
me, do you? - you, whom I have seen so young - you, whom I have
saved as I would my own child, - you, whom I have served as I
would a God - that is to say, for nothing.  Wait awhile! wait
awhile! you shall see what a man can do who has suffered the air
of the fire of the Huguenots, under the beard of monsieur le
cardinal - the true cardinal."  At this moment Louis turned
round.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! are you there, Monsieur
d'Artagnan?" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan saw the movement
and imitated it.  "Yes, sire," said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very well; have the
goodness to wait till I have cast this up."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan made no reply; he
only bowed.  "That is polite enough," thought he; "I have nothing
to say."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis made a violent dash
with his pen, and threw it angrily away.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! go on, work yourself
up!" thought the musketeer; "you will put me at my ease.  You
shall find I did not empty the bag, the other day, at Blois."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis rose from his seat,
passed his hand over his brow, then, stopping opposite to
D'Artagnan, he looked at him with an air at once imperious and
kind,  "What the devil does he want with me?  I wish he would
begin!" thought the musketeer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," said the king,
"you know, without doubt, that monsieur le cardinal is dead?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I suspected so, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You know that,
consequently, I am master in my own kingdom?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is not a thing that
dates from the death of monsieur le cardinal, sire; a man is
always master in his own house, when he wishes to be so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes; but do you not
remember all you said to me at Blois?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Now we come to it," thought
D'Artagnan; "I was not deceived.  Well, so much the better, it is
a sign that my scent is tolerably keen yet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You do not answer me," said
Louis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, I think I
recollect."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You only think?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is so long ago."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "If you do not remember, I
do.  You said to me, - listen with attention."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! I shall listen with all
my ears, sire; for it is very likely the conversation will turn
in a fashion very interesting to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis once more looked at
the musketeer.  The latter smoothed the feather of his hat, then
his mustache, and waited bravely.  Louis XIV. continued: "You
quitted my service, monsieur, after having told me the whole
truth?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is, after having
declared to me all you thought to be true, with regard to my mode
of thinking and acting.  That is always a merit.  You began by
telling me that you had served my family thirty years, and were
fatigued."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I said so; yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you afterwards admitted
that that fatigue was a pretext, and that discontent was the real
cause."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I was discontented, in
fact; but that discontent has never betrayed itself, that I know
of, and if, like a man of heart, I have spoken out before your
majesty, I have not even thought of the matter before anybody
else."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do not excuse yourself,
D'Artagnan, but continue to listen to me.  When making me the
reproach that you were discontented, you received in reply a
promise: - 'Wait.' - Is that not true?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire, as true as what
I told you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You answered me,
'Hereafter!  No, now, immediately.'  Do not excuse yourself, I
tell you.  It was natural, but you had no charity for your poor
prince, Monsieur d'Artagnan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire! - charity for a king,
on the part of a poor soldier!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You understand me very
well; you knew that I stood in need of it; you knew very well
that I was not master; you knew very well that my hope was in the
future.  Now, you answered me when I spoke of the future, 'My
discharge, - and that directly.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is true," murmured
D'Artagnan, biting his mustache.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You did not flatter me when
I was in distress," added Louis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But," said D'Artagnan,
raising his head nobly, "if I did not flatter your majesty when
poor, neither did I betray you.  I have shed my blood for
nothing; I have watched like a dog at a door, knowing full well
that neither bread nor bone would be thrown to me.  I, although
poor likewise, asked nothing of your majesty but the discharge
you speak of."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I know you are a brave man,
but I was a young man, and you ought to have had some indulgence
for me.  What had you to reproach the king with? - that he left
King Charles II. without assistance? - let us say further - that
he did not marry Mademoiselle de Mancini?"  When saying these
words, the king fixed upon the musketeer a searching look.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! ah!" thought the
latter, "he is doing far more than remembering, he divines.  The
devil!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your sentence," continued
Louis, "fell upon the king and fell upon the man.  But, Monsieur
d'Artagnan, that weakness, for you considered it a weakness?" -
D'Artagnan made no reply - "you reproached me also with regard to
monsieur, the defunct cardinal.  Now, monsieur le cardinal, did
he not bring me up, did he not support me? - elevating himself
and supporting himself at the same time, I admit; but the benefit
was discharged.  As an ingrate or an egotist, would you, then,
have better loved or served me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "We will say no more about
it, monsieur; it would only create in you too many regrets, and
me too much pain."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan was not
convinced.  The young king, in adopting a tone of <i>hauteur</i>
with him, did not forward his purpose.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You have since reflected?"
resumed Louis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Upon what, sire?" asked
D'Artagnan, politely.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, upon all that I have
said to you, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire, no doubt - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you have only waited
for an opportunity of retracting your words?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You hesitate, it
seems."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I do not understand what
your majesty did me the honor to say to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis's brow became
cloudy.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Have the goodness to excuse
me, sire; my understanding is particularly thick; things do not
penetrate it without difficulty; but it is true, once they get
in, they remain there."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, yes; you appear to
have a memory."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Almost as good a one as
your majesty's."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then give me quickly one
solution.  My time is valuable.  What have you been doing since
your discharge?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Making my fortune,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The expression is crude,
Monsieur d'Artagnan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your majesty takes it in
bad part, certainly.  I entertain nothing but the profoundest
respect for the king; and if I have been impolite, which might be
excused by my long sojourn in camps and barracks, your majesty is
too much above me to be offended at a word that innocently
escapes from a soldier."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In fact, I know you
performed a brilliant action in England, monsieur.  I only regret
that you have broken your promise."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I!" cried D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Doubtless.  You engaged
your word not to serve any other prince on quitting my service. 
Now it was for King Charles II. that you undertook the marvelous
carrying off of M. Monk."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Pardon me, sire; it was for
myself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And did you succeed?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Like the captains of the
fifteenth century, <i>coups-de-main</i> and adventures."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What do you call
succeeding? - a fortune?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A hundred thousand crowns,
sire, which I now possess - that is, in one week three times as
much money as I ever had in fifty years."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is a handsome sum.  But
you are ambitious, I perceive."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I, sire?  The quarter of
that would be a treasure; and I swear to you I have no thought of
augmenting it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What! you contemplate
remaining idle?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You mean to drop the
sword?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That I have already
done."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Impossible, Monsieur
d'Artagnan," said Louis, firmly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But, sire - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And why, sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Because it is <i>my</i>
wish you should not!" said the young prince, in a voice so stern
and imperious that D'Artagnan evinced surprise and even
uneasiness.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Will your majesty allow me
one word of reply?" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Speak."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I formed that resolution
when I was poor and destitute."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So be it.  Go on."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Now, when by my energy I
have acquired a comfortable means of subsistence, would your
majesty despoil me of my liberty?  Your majesty would condemn me
to the lowest, when I have gained the highest?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who gave you permission,
monsieur, to fathom my designs, or to reckon with me?" replied
Louis, in a voice almost angry; "who told you what I shall do or
what you will yourself do?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire," said the musketeer,
quietly, "as far as I see, freedom is not the order of the
conversation, as it was on the day we came to an explanation at
Blois."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, monsieur; everything is
changed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I tender your majesty my
sincere compliments upon that, but - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But you don't believe
it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am not a great statesman,
and yet I have my eye upon affairs; it seldom fails; now, I do
not see exactly as your majesty does, sire.  The reign of Mazarin
is over, but that of the financiers is begun.  They have the
money; your majesty will not often see much of it.  To live under
the paw of these hungry wolves is hard for a man who reckoned
upon independence."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                At this moment someone
scratched at the door of the cabinet; the king raised his head
proudly.  "Your pardon, Monsieur d'Artagnan," said he; "it is M.
Colbert, who comes to make me a report.  Come in, M.
Colbert."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan drew back. 
Colbert entered with papers in his hand, and went up to the
king.  There can be little doubt that the Gascon did not lose the
opportunity of applying his keen, quick glance to the new figure
which presented itself.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is the inquiry made?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And the opinion of the
inquisitors?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is that the accused merit
confiscation and death."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! ah!" said the king,
without changing countenance, and casting an oblique look at
D'Artagnan.  "And your own opinion, M. Colbert?" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Colbert looked at D'Artagnan
is his turn.  That imposing countenance checked the words upon
his lips.  Louis perceived this.  "Do not disturb yourself," said
he; "it is M. d'Artagnan, - do you not know M. d'Artagnan
again?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                These two men looked at each
other - D'Artagnan, with eyes open and bright as the day -
Colbert, with his half closed, and dim.  The frank intrepidity of
the financier annoyed the other; the circumspection of the
financier disgusted the soldier.  "Ah! ah! this is the gentleman
who made that brilliant stroke in England," said Colbert.  And he
bowed slightly to D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! ah!" said the Gascon,
"this is the gentleman who clipped off the lace from the uniform
of the Swiss!  A praiseworthy piece of economy."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The financier thought to
pierce the musketeer; but the musketeer ran the financier
through.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur d'Artagnan,"
resumed the king, who had not remarked all the shades of which
Mazarin would have missed not one, "this concerns the farmers of
the revenue who have robbed me, whom I am hanging, and whose
death-warrants I am about to sign."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! oh!" said D'Artagnan,
starting.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What did you say?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! nothing, sire.  This is
no business of mine."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king had already taken
up the pen, and was applying it to the paper.  "Sire," said
Colbert in a subdued voice, "I beg to warn your majesty, that if
an example be necessary, there will be difficulty in the
execution of your orders."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What do you say?" said
Louis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You must not conceal from
yourself," continued Colbert quietly, "that attacking the
farmers-general is attacking the superintendence.  The two
unfortunate guilty men in question are the particular friends of
a powerful personage, and the punishment, which otherwise might
be comfortably confined to the Ch&acirc;tlet, will doubtless be a
signal for disturbances!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis colored and turned
towards D'Artagnan, who took a slight bite at his mustache, not
without a smile of pity for the financier, and for the king who
had to listen to him so long.  But Louis seized the pen, and with
a movement so rapid that his hand shook, he affixed his signature
at the bottom of the two papers presented by Colbert, - then
looking the latter in the face, - "Monsieur Colbert," said he,
"when you speak to me on business, exclude more frequently the
word difficulty from your reasonings and opinions; as to the word
impossibility, never pronounce it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Colbert bowed, much
humiliated at having to undergo such a lesson before the
musketeer; he was about to go out, but, jealous to repair his
check: "I forgot to announce to your majesty," said he, "that the
confiscations amount to the sum of five millions of livres."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That's pretty well!"
thought D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Which makes in my coffers?"
said the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eighteen millions of
livres, sire," replied Colbert, bowing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Mordioux!</i>" growled
D'Artagnan, "that's glorious!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur Colbert," added
the king, "you will, if you please, go through the gallery where
M. Lyonne is waiting, and will tell him to bring hither what he
has drawn up - by my order."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Directly, sire; if your
majesty wants me no more this evening?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, monsieur: good-night!" 
And Colbert went out.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Now, let us return to our
affair, M. d'Artagnan," said the king, as if nothing had
happened.  "You see that, with respect to money, there is already
a notable change."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Something to the tune of
from zero to eighteen millions," replied the musketeer gayly. 
"Ah! that was what your majesty wanted the day King Charles II.
came to Blois.  The two states would not have been embroiled
to-day; for I <i>must</i> say, that there also I see another
stumbling-block."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, in the first place,"
replied Louis, "you are unjust, monsieur; for, if Providence had
made me able to give my brother the million that day, you would
not have quitted my service, and, consequently, you would not
have made your fortune, as you told me just now you have done. 
But, in addition to this, I have had another piece of good
fortune; and my difference with Great Britain need not alarm
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                A <i>valet de chambre</i>
interrupted the king by announcing M. Lyonne.  "Come in,
monsieur," said the king; "you are punctual; that is like a good
servant.  Let us see your letter to my brother Charles II."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan pricked up his
ears.  "A moment, monsieur," said Louis carelessly to the Gascon;
"I must expedite to London my consent to the marriage of my
brother, M. le Duc d'Anjou, with the Princess Henrietta
Stuart."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He is knocking me about, it
seems," murmured D'Artagnan, whilst the king signed the letter,
and dismissed M. de Lyonne; "but <i>ma foi!</i> the more he
knocks me about in this manner, the better I like it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king followed M. de
Lyonne with his eyes, till the door was closed behind him; he
even made three steps, as if he would follow the minister; but,
after these three steps, stopping, passing, and coming back to
the musketeer, - "Now, monsieur," said he, "let us hasten to
terminate our affair.  You told me the other day, at Blois, that
you were not rich?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But I am now, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, but that does not
concern me; you have your own money, not mine; <i>that</i> does
not enter into my account."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I do not well understand
what your majesty means."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then, instead of leaving
you to draw out words, speak spontaneously.  Should you be
satisfied with twenty thousand livres a year as a fixed
income?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But, sire" said D'Artagnan,
opening his eyes to the utmost.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Would you be satisfied with
four horses furnished and kept, and with a supplement of funds
such as you might require, according to occasions and needs, or
would you prefer a fixed sum which would be, for example, forty
thousand livres?  Answer."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, your majesty - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, you are surprised;
that is natural, and I expected it.  Answer me, come! or I shall
think you have no longer that rapidity of judgment I have so much
admired in you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is certain, sire, that
twenty thousand livres a year make a handsome sum; but - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No buts!  Yes or no, is it
an honorable indemnity?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! very certainly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You will be satisfied with
it?  That is well.  It will be better to reckon the extra
expenses separately; you can arrange that with Colbert.  Now let
us pass to something more important."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But, sire, I told your
majesty - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That you wanted rest, I
know you did: only I replied that I would not allow it - I am
master, I suppose?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is well.  You were
formerly in the way of becoming captain of the musketeers?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, here is your
commission signed.  I place it in this drawer.  The day on which
you return from a certain expedition which I have to confide to
you, on that day you may yourself take the commission from the
drawer."  D'Artagnan still hesitated, and hung down his head. 
"Come, monsieur," said the king, "one would believe, to look at
you, that you did not know that at the court of the most
Christian king, the captain-general of the musketeers takes
precedence of the mar&eacute;chals of France."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, I know he does."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then, am I to think you do
put no faith in my word?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! sire, never - never
dream of such a thing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have wished to prove to
you, that you, so good a servant, had lost a good master; am I
anything like the master that will suit you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I begin to think you are,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then, monsieur, you will
resume your functions.  Your company is quite disorganized since
your departure, and the men go about drinking and rioting in the
<i>cabarets</i>, where they fight, in spite of my edicts, and
those of my father.  You will reorganize the service as soon as
possible."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You will not again quit my
person."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very well, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You will march with me to
the army, you will encamp round my tent."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then, sire," said
D'Artagnan, "if it is only to impose upon me a service like that,
your majesty need not give me twenty thousand livres a year.  I
shall not earn them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I desire that you shall
keep open house; I desire that you should keep a liberal table; I
desire that my captain of musketeers should be a personage."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And I," said D'Artagnan,
bluntly; "I do not like easily found money; I like money won! 
Your majesty gives me an idle trade, which the first comer would
perform for four thousand livres."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis XIV. began to laugh. 
"You are a true Gascon, Monsieur d'Artagnan; you will draw my
heart's secret from me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bah! has your majesty a
secret, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well! then I accept the
twenty thousand livres, for I will keep that secret, and
discretion is above all price, in these times.  Will your majesty
speak now?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Boot yourself, Monsieur
d'Artagnan, and to horse!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Directly, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Within two days."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is well, sire: for I
have my affairs to settle before I set out; particularly if it is
likely there should be any blows stirring."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That <i>may</i>
happen."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "We can receive them!  But,
sire, you have addressed yourself to avarice, to ambition; you
have addressed yourself to the heart of M. d'Artagnan, but you
have forgotten one thing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What is that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You have said nothing to
his vanity; when shall I be a knight of the king's orders?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Does that interest
you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, yes, sire.  My friend
Athos is quite covered with orders, and that dazzles me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You shall be a knight of my
order a month after you have taken your commission of
captain."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! ah!" said the officer,
thoughtfully, "after the expedition."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Precisely."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Where is your majesty going
to send me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Are you acquainted with
Bretagne?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Have you any friends
there?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In Bretagne?  No, <i>ma
foi!</i>"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So much the better.  Do you
know anything about fortifications?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I believe I do, sire," said
D'Artagnan, smiling.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is to say you can
readily distinguish a fortress from a simple fortification, such
as is allowed to <i>ch&acirc;telains</i> or vassals?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I distinguish a fort from a
rampart as I distinguish a cuirass from a raised pie-crust,
sire.  Is that sufficient?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur.  You will
set out, then."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "For Bretagne?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Alone?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Absolutely alone.  That is
to say, you must not even take a lackey with you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "May I ask your majesty for
what reason?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Because, monsieur, it will
be necessary to disguise yourself sometimes, as the servant of a
good family.  Your face is very well known in France, M.
d'Artagnan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And then, sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And then you will travel
slowly through Bretagne, and will examine the fortifications of
that country."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The coasts?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, and the isles;
commencing by Belle-&Icirc;le-en-Mer."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! which belongs to M.
Fouquet!" said D'Artagnan, in a serious tone, raising his
intelligent eye to Louis XIV.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I fancy you are right,
monsieur, and that Bell-Isle <i>does</i> belong to M. Fouquet, in
fact."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then your majesty wishes me
to ascertain if Belle-Isle is a strong place?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "If the fortifications of it
are new or old?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Precisely."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And if the vassals of M.
Fouquet are sufficiently numerous to form a garrison?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is what I want to
know; you have placed your finger on the question."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And if they are not
fortifying, sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You will travel about
Bretagne, listening and judging."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then  I am a king's spy?"
said D'Artagnan, bluntly, twisting his mustache.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your pardon sire; I spy on
your majesty's account."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You start on a voyage of
discovery, monsieur.  Would you march at the head of your
musketeers, with your sword in your hand, to observe any spot
whatever, or an enemy's position?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                At this word D'Artagnan
started.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do you," continued the
king, "imagine yourself to be a spy?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, no," said D'Artagnan,
but pensively; "the thing changes its face when one observes an
enemy: one is but a soldier.  And if they are fortifying
Belle-Isle?" added he, quickly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You will take an exact plan
of the fortifications."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Will they permit me to
enter?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That does not concern me;
that is <i>your</i> affair.  Did you not understand that I
reserved for you a supplement of twenty thousand livres per
annum, if you wished it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire; but if they are
not fortifying?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You will return quietly,
without fatiguing your horse."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, I am ready."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You will begin to-morrow by
going to monsieur le surintendant's to take the first quarter of
the pension I give you.  Do you know M. Fouquet?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very little, sire; but I
beg your majesty to observe that I don't think it immediately
necessary that I <i>should</i> know him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your pardon, monsieur; for
he will refuse you the money I wish you to take; and it is that
refusal I look for."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah!" said D'Artagnan. 
"Then, sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The money being refused,
you will go and seek it at M. Colbert's.  <i>A propos</i>, have
you a good horse?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "An excellent one,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How much did it cost
you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A hundred and fifty
pistoles."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I will buy it of you.  Here
is a note for two hundred pistoles."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But I want a horse for my
journey, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, and you take mine
from me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Not at all.  On the
contrary, I give it you.  Only as it is now mine and not yours, I
am sure you will not spare it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your majesty is in a hurry,
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A great hurry."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then what compels me to
wait two days?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Reasons known to
myself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That's a different affair. 
The horse may make up the two days, in the eight he has to
travel; and then there is the post."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, no, the post
compromises, Monsieur d'Artagnan.  Begone and do not forget you
are my servant."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, it is not my duty to
forget it!  At what hour to-morrow shall I take my leave of your
majesty?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Whence do you lodge?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I must henceforward lodge
at the Louvre."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That must not be now - keep
your lodgings in the city: I will pay for them.  As to your
departure, it must take place at night; you must set out without
being seen by any one, or, if you are seen, it must not be known
that you belong to me.  Keep your mouth shut, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your majesty spoils all you
have said by that single word."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I asked where you lodged,
for I cannot always send to M. le Comte de la F&egrave;re to seek
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I lodge with M. Planchet, a
grocer, Rue des Lombards, at the sign of the Pilon d'Or."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Go out but little, show
yourself less, and await my orders."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And yet, sire, I must go
for the money."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is true, but when
going to the superintendence, where so many people are constantly
going, you must mingle with the crowd."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I want the notes, sire, for
the money."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Here they are."  The king
signed them, and D'Artagnan looked on, to assure himself of their
regularity.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Adieu!  Monsieur
d'Artagnan," added the king; "I think you have perfectly
understood me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I?  I understand that your
majesty sends me to Belle-&Icirc;le-en-Mer, that is all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To learn?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To learn how M. Fouquet's
works are going on; that is all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very well: I admit you may
be taken."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And I do not admit it,"
replied the Gascon, boldly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I admit you may be killed,"
continued the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is not probable,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In the first case, you must
not speak; in the second there must be no papers found upon
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan shrugged his
shoulders without ceremony, and took leave of the king, saying to
himself: - "The English shower continues - let us remain under
the spout!"</p>

D'Artagnan was returning to Planchet's house, his head aching and
bewildered with all that had happened to him, there was passing a
scene of quite a different character, and which, nevertheless, is
not foreign to the conversation our musketeer had just had with
the king; only this scene took place out of Paris, in a house
possessed by the superintendent Fouquet in the village of
Saint-Mand&eacute;.  The minister had just arrived at this
country-house, followed by his principal clerk, who carried an
enormous portfolio full of papers to be examined, and others
waiting for signature.  As it might be about five o'clock in the
afternoon, the masters had dined: supper was being prepared for
twenty subaltern guests.  The superintendent did not stop: on
alighting from his carriage, he, at the same bound, sprang
through the doorway, traversed the apartments and gained his
cabinet, where he declared he would shut himself up to work,
commanding that he should not be disturbed for anything but an
order from the king.  As soon as this order was given, Fouquet
shut himself up, and two footmen were placed as sentinels at his
door.  Then Fouquet pushed a bolt which displaced a panel that
walled up the entrance, and prevented everything that passed in
this apartment from being either seen or heard.  But, against all
probability, it was only for the sake of shutting himself up that
Fouquet shut himself up thus, for he went straight to a bureau,
seated himself at it, opened the portfolio, and began to make a
choice amongst the enormous mass of papers it contained.  It was
not more than ten minutes after he had entered, and taken all the
precautions we have described, when the repeated noise of several
slight equal knocks struck his ear, and appeared to fix his
utmost attention.  Fouquet raised his head, turned his ear, and
listened.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The strokes continued.  Then
the worker arose with a slight movement of impatience and walked
straight up to a glass behind which the blows were struck by a
hand, or by some invisible mechanism.  It was a large glass let
into a panel.  Three other glasses, exactly similar to it,
completed the symmetry of the apartment.  Nothing distinguished
that one from the others.  Without doubt, these reiterated knocks
were a signal; for, at the moment Fouquet approached the glass
listening, the same noise was renewed, and in the same measure. 
"Oh! oh!" murmured the <i>intendant</i>, with surprise, "who is
yonder?  I did not expect anybody to-day."  And without doubt, to
respond to the signal, he pulled out a gilded nail near the
glass, and shook it thrice.  Then returning to his place, and
seating himself again, "<i>Ma foi!</i> let them wait," said he. 
And plunging again into the ocean of papers unrolled before him,
he appeared to think of nothing now but work.  In fact, with
incredible rapidity and marvelous lucidity, Fouquet deciphered
the largest papers and most complicated writings, correcting
them, annotating them with a pen moved as if by a fever, and the
work melting under his hands, signatures, figures, references,
became multiplied as if ten clerks - that is to say, a hundred
fingers and ten brains had performed the duties, instead of the
five fingers and single brain of this man.  From time to time,
only, Fouquet, absorbed by his work, raised his head to cast a
furtive glance upon a clock placed before him.  The reason of
this was, Fouquet set himself a task, and when this task was once
set, in one hour's work he, by himself, did what another would
not have accomplished in a day; always certain, consequently,
provided he was not disturbed, of arriving at the close in the
time his devouring activity had fixed.  But in the midst of his
ardent labor, the soft strokes upon the little bell placed behind
the glass sounded again, hasty, and, consequently, more
urgent.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The lady appears to be
impatient," said Fouquet.  "Humph! a calm!  That must be the
comtesse; but, no, the comtesse is gone to Rambouillet for three
days.  The pr&eacute;sidente, then?  Oh! no, the
pr&eacute;sidente would not assume such grand airs; she would
ring very humbly, then she would wait my good pleasure.  The
greatest certainty is, that I do not know who it can be, but that
I know who it cannot be.  And since it is not you, marquise,
since it cannot be you, deuce take the rest!"  And he went on
with his work in spite of the reiterated appeals of the bell.  At
the end of a quarter of an hour, however, impatience prevailed
over Fouquet in his turn: he might be said to consume, rather
than to complete the rest of his work; he thrust his papers into
his portfolio, and giving a glance at the mirror, whilst the taps
continued faster than ever: "Oh! oh!" said he, "whence comes all
this racket?  What has happened, and who can the Ariadne be who
expects me so impatiently.  Let us see!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                He then applied the tip of
his finger to the nail parallel to the one he had drawn. 
Immediately the glass moved like a folding-door and discovered a
secret closet, rather deep, into which the superintendent
disappeared as if going into a vast box.  When there, he touched
another spring, which opened, not a board, but a block of the
wall, and he went out by that opening, leaving the door to shut
of itself.  Then Fouquet descended about a score of steps which
sank, winding, underground, and came to a long, subterranean
passage, lighted by imperceptible loopholes.  The walls of this
vault were covered with slabs or tiles, and the floor with
carpeting.  This passage was under the street itself, which
separated Fouquet's house from the Park of Vincennes.  At the end
of the passage ascended a winding staircase parallel with that by
which Fouquet had entered.  He mounted these other stairs,
entered by means of a spring placed in a closet similar to that
in his cabinet, and from this closet an untenanted chamber
furnished with the utmost elegance.  As soon as he entered, he
examined carefully whether the glass closed without leaving any
trace, and, doubtless satisfied with his observation, he opened
by means of a small gold key the triple fastenings of a door in
front of him.  This time the door opened upon a handsome cabinet,
sumptuously furnished, in which was seated upon cushions a lady
of surpassing beauty, who at the sound of the lock sprang towards
Fouquet.  "Ah! good heavens!" cried the latter, starting back
with astonishment.  "Madame la Marquise de Belli&egrave;re, you
here?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes," murmured la
marquise.  "Yes; it is I, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Marquise! dear marquise!"
added Fouquet, ready to prostrate himself.  "Ah! my God! how did
you come here?  And I, to keep you waiting!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A long time, monsieur; yes,
a very long time!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am happy in thinking this
waiting has appeared long to you, marquise!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! an eternity, monsieur;
oh!  I rang more than twenty times.  Did you not hear me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Marquise, you are pale, you
tremble."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Did you not hear, then,
that you were summoned?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, yes; I heard plainly
enough, madame; but I could not come.  After your rigors and your
refusals, how could I dream it was you?  If I could have had any
suspicion of the happiness that awaited me, believe me, madame, I
would have quitted everything to fall at your feet, as I do at
this moment."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Are we quite alone,
monsieur?" asked the marquise, looking round the room.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, yes, madame, I can
assure you of that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Really?" said the marquise,
in a melancholy tone.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You sigh!" said
Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What mysteries! what
precautions!" said the marquise, with a slight bitterness of
expression; "and how evident it is that you fear the least
suspicion of your amours to escape."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Would you prefer their
being made public?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, no; you act like a
delicate man," said the marquise, smiling.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Come, dear marquise, punish
me not with reproaches, I implore you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Reproaches!  Have I a right
to make you any?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, unfortunately, no; but
tell me, you, who during a year I have loved without return or
hope - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are mistaken - without
hope it is true, but not without return."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What! for me, of my love!
there is but one proof, and that proof I still want."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am here to bring it,
monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Fouquet wished to clasp her
in his arms, but she disengaged herself with a gesture.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You persist in deceiving
yourself, monsieur, and will never accept of me the only thing I
am willing to give you - devotion."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, then, you do not love
me?  Devotion is but a virtue, love is a passion."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Listen to me, I implore
you: I should not have come hither without a serious motive: you
are well assured of that, are you not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The motive is of very
little consequence, so that you are but here - so that I see you
- so that I speak to you!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are right; the
principal thing is that I am here without any one having seen me,
and that I can speak to you." - Fouquet sank on his knees before
her.  "Speak! speak, madame!" said he, "I listen to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The marquise looked at
Fouquet, on his knees at her feet, and there was in the looks of
the woman a strange mixture of love and melancholy.  "Oh!" at
length murmured she, "would that I were she who has the right of
seeing you every minute, of speaking to you every instant! would
that I were she who might watch over you, she who would have no
need of mysterious springs to summon and cause to appear, like a
sylph, the man she loves, to look at him for an hour, and then
see him disappear in the darkness of a mystery, still more
strange at his going out than at his coming in.  Oh! that would
be to live like a happy woman!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do you happen, marquise,"
said Fouquet, smiling, "to be speaking of my wife?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, certainly, of her I
spoke."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, you need not envy her
lot, marquise; of all the women with whom I have had any
relations, Madame Fouquet is the one I see the least of, and who
has the least intercourse with me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "At least, monsieur, she is
not reduced to place, as I have done, her hand upon the ornament
of a glass to call you to her; at least you do not reply to her
by the mysterious, alarming sound of a bell, the spring of which
comes from I don't know where; at least you have not forbidden
her to endeavor to discover the secret of these communications
under pain of breaking off forever your connections with her, as
you have forbidden all who come here before me, and who will come
after me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Dear marquise, how unjust
you are, and how little do you know what you are doing in thus
exclaiming against mystery; it is with mystery alone we can love
without trouble; it is with love without trouble alone that we
can be happy.  But let us return to ourselves, to that devotion
of which you were speaking, or rather let me labor under a
pleasing delusion, and believe this devotion is love."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Just now," repeated the
marquise, passing over her eyes a hand that might have been a
model for the graceful contours of antiquity; "just now I was
prepared to speak, my ideas were clear and bold; now I am quite
confused, quite troubled; I fear I bring you bad news."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "If it is to that bad news I
owe your presence, marquise, welcome be even that bad news! or
rather, marquise, since you allow that I am not quite indifferent
to you, let me hear nothing of the bad news, but speak of
yourself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, no, on the contrary,
demand it of me; require me to tell it to you instantly, and not
to allow myself to be turned aside by any feeling whatever. 
Fouquet, my friend! it is of immense importance."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You astonish me, marquise;
I will even say you almost frighten me.  You, so serious, so
collected; you who know the world we live in so well.  Is it,
then, important?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! very important."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In the first place, how did
you come here?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You shall know that
presently; but first to something of more consequence."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Speak, marquise, speak!  I
implore you, have pity on my impatience."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do you know that Colbert is
made intendant of the finances?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bah! Colbert, little
Colbert."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, Colbert, <i>little</i>
Colbert."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Mazarin's factotum?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The same."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well! what do you see so
terrific in that, dear marquise? little Colbert is intendant;
that is astonishing I confess, but is not terrible."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do you think the king has
given, without pressing motive, such a place to one you call a
little <i>cuistre?</i>"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In the first place, is it
positively true that the king has given it to him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is so said."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ay, but who says so?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Everybody."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Everybody, that's nobody;
mention some one likely to be well informed who says so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Madame Vanel."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! now you begin to
frighten me in earnest," said Fouquet, laughing; "if any one is
well informed, or ought to be well informed, it is the person you
name."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do not speak ill of poor
Marguerite, Monsieur Fouquet, for she still loves you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bah! indeed?  That is
scarcely credible.  I thought little Colbert, as you said just
now, had passed over that love, and left the impression upon it
of a spot of ink or a stain of grease."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Fouquet!  Fouquet!  Is this
the way you always treat the poor creatures you desert?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, you surely are not
going to undertake the defense of Madame Vanel?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, I will undertake it;
for, I repeat, she loves you still, and the proof is she saves
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But your interposition,
marquise; that is very cunning on her part.  No angel could be
more agreeable to me, or could lead me more certainly to
salvation.  But, let me ask you, do you know Marguerite?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "She was my convent
friend."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you say that she has
informed you that Monsieur Colbert was named intendant?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, she did."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, enlighten me,
marquise; granted Monsieur Colbert is intendant - so be it.  In
what can an intendant, that is to say my subordinate, my clerk,
give me umbrage or injure me, even if he <i>is</i> Monsieur
Colbert?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You do not reflect,
monsieur, apparently," replied the marquise.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Upon what?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This: that Monsieur Colbert
hates you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Hates me?" cried Fouquet. 
"Good heavens! marquise, whence do you come? where can you live? 
Hates me! why all the world hates me, he, of course, as others
do."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He more than others."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "More than others - let
him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He is ambitious."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who is not, marquise."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, but with him ambition
has no bounds."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am quite aware of that,
since he made it a point to succeed me with Madame Vanel."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And obtained his end; look
at that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do you mean to say he has
the presumption to pass from intendant to superintendent?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Have you not yourself
already had the same fear?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! oh!" said Fouquet, "to
succeed with Madame Vanel is one thing, to succeed me with the
king is another.  France is not to be purchased so easily as the
wife of a <i>ma&icirc;tre des comptes</i>."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eh! monsieur, everything is
to be bought; if not by gold, by intrigue."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Nobody knows to the
contrary better than you, madame, you to whom I have offered
millions."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Instead of millions,
Fouquet, you should have offered me a true, only and boundless
love: I might have accepted that.  So you see, still, everything
is to be bought, if not in one way, by another."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So, Colbert, in your
opinion, is in a fair way of bargaining for my place of
superintendent.  Make yourself easy on that head, my dear
marquise; he is not yet rich enough to purchase it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But if he should rob you of
it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! that is another thing. 
Unfortunately, before he can reach me, that is to say, the body
of the place, he must destroy, must make a breach in the advanced
works, and I am devilishly well fortified, marquise."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What you call your advanced
works are your creatures, are they not - your friends?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Exactly so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And is M. d'Eymeris one of
your creatures?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, he is."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is M. Lyodot one of your
friends?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Certainly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "M. de Vanin?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "M. de Vanin! ah! they may
do what they like with him, but - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But they must not touch the
others!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, if you are anxious
they should not touch MM. d'Eymeris and Lyodot, it is time to
look about you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who threatens them?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Will you listen to me
now?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Attentively, marquise."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Without interrupting
me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Speak."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, this morning
Marguerite sent for me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And what did she want with
you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "'I dare not see M. Fouquet
myself,' said she."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bah! why should she think I
would reproach her?  Poor woman, she vastly deceives
herself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "'See him yourself,' said
she, 'and tell him to beware of M. Colbert.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What! she warned me to
beware of her lover?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have told you she still
loves you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Go on, marquise."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "'M. Colbert,' she added,
'came to me two hours ago, to inform me he was appointed
intendant.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have already told you,
marquise, that M. Colbert would only be the more in my power for
that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, but that is not all:
Marguerite is intimate, as you know, with Madame d'Eymeris and
Madame Lyodot."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I know it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, M. Colbert put many
questions to her, relative to the fortunes of these two
gentlemen, and as to the devotion they had for you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, as to those two, I can
answer for them; they must be killed before they will cease to be
mine."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then, as Madame Vanel was
obliged to quit M. Colbert for an instant to receive a visitor,
and as M. Colbert is industrious, scarcely was the new intendant
left alone, before he took a pencil from his pocket, and, there
was paper on the table, began to make notes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Notes concerning d'Eymeris
and Lyodot?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Exactly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I should like to know what
those notes were about."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And that is just what I
have brought you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Madame Vanel has taken
Colbert's notes and sent them to me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No; but by a chance which
resembles a miracle, she has a duplicate of those notes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How could she get
that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Listen; I told you that
Colbert found paper on the table."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That he took a pencil from
his pocket."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And wrote upon that
paper."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, this pencil was a
lead-pencil, consequently hard; so, it marked in black upon the
first sheet, and in white upon the second."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Go on."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Colbert, when tearing off
the first sheet, took no notice of the second."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, on the second was to
be read what had been written on the first; Madame Vanel read it,
and sent for me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then, when she was assured
I was your devoted friend, she gave me the paper, and told me the
secret of this house."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And this paper?" said
Fouquet, in some degree of agitation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Here it is, monsieur - read
it," said the marquise.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Fouquet read:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Names of the farmers of
revenue to be condemned by the Chamber of Justice: D'Eymeris,
friend of M. F.; Lyodot, friend of M. F.; De Vanin, indif."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "D'Eymeris and Lyodot!"
cried Fouquet, reading the paper eagerly again.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Friends of M. F.," pointed
the marquise with her finger.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But what is the meaning of
these words: 'To be condemned by the Chamber of Justice'?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Dame!</i>" said the
marquise, "that is clear enough, I think.  Besides, that is not
all.  Read on, read on;" and Fouquet continued, - "The two first
to death, the third to be dismissed, with MM. d'Hautemont and de
la Vallette, who will only have their property confiscated."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Great God!" cried Fouquet,
"to death, to death!  Lyodot and D'Eymeris.  But even if the
Chamber of Justice should condemn them to death, the king will
never ratify their condemnation, and they cannot be executed
without the king's signature."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The king has made M.
Colbert intendant."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!" cried Fouquet, as if
he caught a glimpse of the abyss that yawned beneath his feet,
"impossible! impossible!  But who passed a pencil over the marks
made by Colbert?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I did.  I was afraid the
first would be effaced."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! I will know all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You will know nothing,
monsieur; you despise your enemy too much for that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Pardon me, my dear
marquise; excuse me; yes, M. Colbert is my enemy, I believe him
to be so; yes, M. Colbert is a man to be dreaded, I admit.  But
I!  I have time, and as you are here, as you have assured me of
your devotion, as you have allowed me to hope for your love, as
we are alone - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I came here to save you,
Monsieur Fouquet, and not to ruin myself," said the marquise,
rising - "therefore, beware! - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Marquise, in truth you
terrify yourself too much at least, unless this terror is but a
pretext - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He is very deep, very deep;
this M. Colbert: beware!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Fouquet, in his turn, drew
himself up.  "And I?" asked he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you, you have only a
noble heart.  Beware! beware!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have done what was right,
my friend, at the risk of my reputation.  Adieu!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Not adieu, <i>au
revoir!</i>"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Perhaps," said the
marquise, giving her hand to Fouquet to kiss, and walking towards
the door with so firm a step, that he did not dare to bar her
passage.  As to Fouquet, he retook, with his head hanging down
and a fixed cloud on his brow, the path of the subterranean
passage along which ran the metal wires that communicated from
one house to the other, transmitting, through two glasses, the
wishes and signals of hidden correspondents.</p>

hastened back to his apartment by the subterranean passage, and
immediately closed the mirror with the spring.  He was scarcely
in his closet, when he heard some one knocking violently at the
door, and a well-known voice crying: - "Open the door,
monseigneur, I entreat you, open the door!"  Fouquet quickly
restored a little order to everything that might have revealed
either his absence or his agitation: he spread his papers over
the desk, took up a pen, and, to gain time, said, through the
closed door, - "Who is there?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What, monseigneur, do you
not know me?" replied the voice.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, yes," said Fouquet to
himself, "yes, my friend, I know you well enough."  And then,
aloud: "Is it not Gourville?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, yes, monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Fouquet arose, cast a look
at one of his glasses, went to the door, pushed back the bolt,
and Gourville entered.  "Ah! monseigneur! monseigneur!" cried he,
"what cruelty!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In what?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have been a quarter of an
hour imploring you to open the door, and you would not even
answer me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Once and for all, you know
that I will not be disturbed when I am busy.  Now, although I
might make you an exception, Gourville, I insist upon my orders
being respected by others."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monseigneur, at this
moment, orders, doors, bolts, locks, and walls I could have
broken, forced and overthrown!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! ah! it relates to some
great event, then?" asked Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! I assure you it does,
monseigneur," replied Gourville.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And what is this event?"
said Fouquet, a little troubled by the evident agitation of his
most intimate confidant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "There is a secret chamber
of justice instituted, monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I know there is, but do the
members meet, Gourville?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "They not only meet, but
they have passed a sentence, monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A sentence?" said the
superintendent, with a shudder and pallor he could not conceal. 
"A sentence! - and on whom?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Two of your best
friends."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Lyodot and D'Eymeris, do
you mean?  But what sort of a sentence?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sentence of death."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Passed?  Oh! you must be
mistaken, Gourville; that is impossible."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Here is a copy of the
sentence which the king is to sign to-day, if he has not already
signed it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Fouquet seized the paper
eagerly, read it, and returned it to Gourville.  "The king will
never sign that," said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Gourville shook his
head.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monseigneur, M. Colbert is
a bold councilor: do not be too confident!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur Colbert again!"
cried Fouquet.  "How is it that that name rises upon all
occasions to torment my ears, during the last two or three days? 
You make so trifling a subject of too much importance,
Gourville.  Let M. Colbert appear, I will face him; let him raise
his head, I will crush him; but you understand, there must be an
outline upon which my look may fall, there must be a surface upon
which my feet may be placed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Patience, monseigneur; for
you do not know what Colbert is - study him quickly; it is with
this dark financier as it is with meteors, which the eye never
sees completely before their disastrous invasion; when we feel
them we are dead."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! Gourville, this is
going too far," replied Fouquet, smiling; "allow me, my friend,
not to be so easily frightened; M. Colbert a meteor! 
<i>Corbleu</i>, we confront the meteor.  Let us see acts, and not
words.  What has he done?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He has ordered two gibbets
of the executioner of Paris," answered Gourville.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Fouquet raised his head, and
a flash gleamed from his eyes.  "Are you sure of what you say?"
cried he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Here is the proof,
monseigneur."  And Gourville held out to the superintendent a
note communicated by a certain secretary of the H&ocirc;tel de
Ville, who was one of Fouquet's creatures.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, that is true,"
murmured the minister; "the scaffold may be prepared, but the
king has not signed; Gourville, the king will not sign."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I shall soon know," said
Gourville.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "If the king has signed, the
gibbets will be sent this evening to the H&ocirc;tel de Ville, in
order to be got up and ready by to-morrow morning."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! no, no!" cried the
superintendent, once again; "you are all deceived, and deceive me
in my turn; Lyodot came to see me only the day before yesterday;
only three days ago I received a present of some Syracuse wine
from poor D'Eymeris."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What does that prove?"
replied Gourville, "except that the chamber of justice has been
secretly assembled, has deliberated in the absence of the
accused, and that the whole proceeding was complete when they
were arrested."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What! are they, then,
arrested?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No doubt they are."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But where, when, and how
have they been arrested?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Lyodot, yesterday at
daybreak; D'Eymeris, the day before yesterday, in the evening, as
he was returning from the house of his mistress; their
disappearances had disturbed nobody; but at length M. Colbert all
at once raised the mask, and caused the affair to be published;
it is being cried by sound of trumpet, at this moment in Paris,
and, in truth, monseigneur, there is scarcely anybody but
yourself ignorant of the event."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Fouquet began to walk about
in his chamber with an uneasiness that became more and more
serious.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What do you decide upon,
monseigneur?" said Gourville.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "If it were really as easy
as you say, I would go to the king," cried Fouquet.  "But as I go
to the Louvre, I will pass by the H&ocirc;tel de Ville.  We shall
see if the sentence is signed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Incredulity! thou art the
pest of all great minds," said Gourville, shrugging his
shoulders.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Gourville!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes," continued he, "and
incredulity! thou ruinest, as contagion destroys the most robust
health; that is to say, in an instant."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Let us go," cried Fouquet;
"desire the door to be opened, Gourville."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Be cautious," said the
latter, "the Abb&eacute; Fouquet is there."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! my brother," replied
Fouquet, in a tone of annoyance; "he is there, is he? he knows
all the ill news, then, and is rejoiced to bring it to me, as
usual.  The devil! if my brother is there, my affairs are bad,
Gourville; why did you not tell me that sooner: I should have
been the more readily convinced."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monseigneur calumniates
him," said Gourville, laughing; "if he is come, it is not with a
bad intention."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What, do you excuse him?"
cried Fouquet; "a fellow without a heart, without ideas; a
devourer of wealth."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He knows you are rich."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And would ruin me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, but he would have your
purse.  That is all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Enough! enough!  A hundred
thousand crowns per month, during two years.  <i>Corbleu!</i> it
is I that pay, Gourville, and I know my figures."  Gourville
laughed in a silent, sly manner.  "Yes, yes, you mean to say it
is the king pays," said the superintendent.  "Ah, Gourville, that
is a vile joke; this is not the place."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monseigneur, do not be
angry."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, then, send away the
Abb&eacute; Fouquet; I have not a sou."  Gourville made a step
towards the door.  "He has been a month without seeing me,"
continued Fouquet, "why could he not be <i>two</i> months?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Because he repents of
living in bad company," said Gourville, "and prefers you to all
his bandits."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thanks for the preference! 
You make a strange advocate, Gourville, to-day - the advocate of
the Abb&eacute; Fouquet!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eh! but everything and
every man has a good side - their useful side, monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The bandits whom the
abb&eacute; keeps in pay and drink have their useful side, have
they?  Prove that, if you please."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Let the circumstance arise,
monseigneur, and you will be very glad to have these bandits
under your hand."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You advise me, then, to be
reconciled to the abb&eacute;?" said Fouquet, ironically.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I advise you, monseigneur,
not to quarrel with a hundred or a hundred and twenty loose
fellows, who, by putting their rapiers end to end, would form a
cordon of steel capable of surrounding three thousand men."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Fouquet darted a searching
glance at Gourville, and passing before him, - "That is all very
well; let M. l'Abb&eacute; Fouquet be introduced," said he to the
footman.  "You are right, Gourville."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Two minutes after, the
Abb&eacute; Fouquet appeared in the doorway, with profound
reverence.  He was a man of from forty to forty-five years of
age, half churchman, half soldier, - a <i>spadassin</i> grafted
upon an abb&eacute;; upon seeing that he had not a sword by his
side, you might be sure he had pistols.  Fouquet saluted him more
as elder brother than as a minister.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What can I do to serve you,
monsieur l'abb&eacute;?" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! oh! how coldly you
speak to me, brother!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I speak like a man who is
in a hurry, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The abb&eacute; looked
maliciously at Gourville, and anxiously at Fouquet, and said, "I
have three hundred pistoles to pay to M. de Bregi this evening. 
A play debt, a sacred debt."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What next?" said Fouquet
bravely, for he comprehended that the Abb&eacute; Fouquet would
not have disturbed him for such a want.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A thousand to my butcher,
who will supply no more meat."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Next?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Twelve hundred to my
tailor," continued the abb&eacute;; "the fellow has made me take
back seven suits of my people's, which compromises my liveries,
and my mistress talks of replacing me by a farmer of the revenue,
which would be a humiliation for the church."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What else?" said
Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You will please to remark,"
said the abb&eacute;, humbly, "that I have asked nothing for
myself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is delicate,
monsieur," replied Fouquet; "so, as you see, I wait."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And I ask nothing, oh! no,
- it is not for want of need, though, I assure you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The minister reflected for a
minute.  "Twelve hundred pistoles to the tailor; that seems a
great deal for clothes," said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I maintain a hundred men,"
said the abb&eacute;, proudly; "that is a charge, I believe."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why a hundred men?" said
Fouquet.  "Are you a Richelieu or a Mazarin, to require a hundred
men as a guard?  What use do you make of these men? - speak."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And do you ask me that?"
cried the Abb&eacute; Fouquet; "ah! how can you put such a
question, - why I maintain a hundred men?  Ah!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, yes, I do put that
question to you.  What have you to do with a hundred men? -
answer."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ingrate!" continued the
abb&eacute;, more and more affected.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Explain yourself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, monsieur the
superintendent, I only want one <i>valet de chambre</i>, for
<i>my</i> part, and even if I were alone, could help myself very
well; but you, you who have so many enemies - a hundred men are
not enough for me to defend you with.  A hundred men! - you ought
to have ten thousand.  I maintain, then, these men in order that
in public places, in assemblies, no voice may be raised against
you; and without them, monsieur, you would be loaded with
imprecations, you would be torn to pieces, you would not last a
week; no, not a week, do you understand?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! I did not know you were
my champion to such an extent, monsieur le abb&eacute;."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You doubt it!" cried the
abb&eacute;.  "Listen, then, to what happened, no longer ago than
yesterday, in the Rue de la Hochette.  A man was cheapening a
fowl."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, how could that injure
me, abb&eacute;?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This way.  The fowl was not
fat.  The purchaser refused to give eighteen sous for it, saying
that he could not afford eighteen sous for the skin of a fowl
from which M. Fouquet had sucked all the fat."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Go on."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The joke caused a deal of
laughter," continued the abb&eacute;; "laughter at your expense,
death to the devils! and the <i>canaille</i> were delighted.  The
joker added, 'Give me a fowl fed by M. Colbert, if you like! and
I will pay all you ask.'  And immediately there was a clapping of
hands.  A frightful scandal! you understand; a scandal which
forces a brother to hide his face."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Fouquet colored.  "And you
veiled it?" said the superintendent.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, for so it happened I
had one of my men in the crowd; a new recruit from the provinces,
one M. Menneville, whom I like very much.  He made his way
through the press, saying to the joker: '<i>Mille barbes!</i> 
Monsieur the false joker, here's a thrust for  Colbert!'  'And
one for Fouquet,' replied the joker.  Upon which they drew in
front of the cook's shop, with a hedge of the curious round them,
and five hundred as curious at the windows."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well?" said Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, monsieur, my
Menneville spitted the joker, to the great astonishment of the
spectators, and said to the cook: - 'Take this goose, my friend,
for it is fatter than your fowl.'  That is the way, monsieur,"
ended the abb&eacute; , triumphantly, "in which I spend my
revenues; I maintain the honor of the family, monsieur."  Fouquet
hung his head.  "And I have a hundred as good as he," continued
the abb&eacute;.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very well," said Fouquet,
"give the account to Gourville, and remain here this
evening."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Shall we have supper?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, there will be
supper."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But the chest is
closed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Gourville will open it for
you.  Leave us, monsieur l'abb&eacute;, leave us."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then we are friends?" said
the abb&eacute;, with a bow.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, yes, friends.  Come,
Gourville."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Are you going out?  You
will not stay to supper, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I shall be back in an hour;
rest easy, abb&eacute;."  Then aside to Gourville, - "Let them
put to my English horses," said he, "and direct the coachman to
stop at the H&ocirc;tel de Ville de Paris."</p>

already the whole house was getting warm with the preparations

upon the roads to Paris, and going by the quays, in order to meet
fewer people on the way, soon reached the H&ocirc;tel de Ville. 
It wanted a quarter to eight.  Fouquet alighted at the corner of
the Rue de Long-Pont, and, on foot, directed his course towards
the Place de Gr&egrave;ve, accompanied by Gourville.  At the
turning of the Place they saw a man dressed in black and violet,
of dignified mien, who was preparing to stop at Vincennes.  He
had before him a large hamper filled with bottles, which he had
just purchased at the <i>cabaret</i> with the sign of

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monseigneur," replied
the latter.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What can he have been doing
at the sign of L'Image-de-Notre-Dame?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Buying wine, no doubt."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What! buy wine for me, at a
<i>cabaret?</i>" said Fouquet.  "My cellar, then, must be in a
miserable condition!" and he advanced towards the <i>ma&icirc;tre
d'h&ocirc;tel</i>, who was arranging his bottles in the carriage
with the most minute care.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Hol&agrave;!</i> 
Vatel," said he, in the voice of a master.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Take care, monseigneur!"
said Gourville, "you will be recognized."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very well!  Of what
consequence? - Vatel!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The man dressed in black and
violet turned round.  He had a good and mild countenance, without
expression - a mathematician minus the pride.  A certain fire
sparkled in the eyes of this personage, a rather sly smile played
round his lips; but the observer might soon have remarked that
this fire and this smile applied to nothing, enlightened
nothing.  Vatel laughed like an absent man, and amused himself
like a child.  At the sound of his master's voice he turned
round, exclaiming: "Oh! monseigneur!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, it is I.  What the
devil are you doing here, Vatel?  Wine!  You are buying wine at a
<i>cabaret</i> in the Place de Gr&egrave;ve!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But, monseigneur," said
Vatel, quietly after having darted a hostile glance at Gourville,
"why am I interfered with here?  Is my cellar kept in bad
order?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, certes, Vatel, no; but
- "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But what?" replied Vatel. 
Gourville touched Fouquet's elbow.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Don't be angry, Vatel; I
thought my cellar - your cellar - sufficiently well stocked for
us to be able to dispense with recourse to the cellar of
L'Image-de-Notre-Dame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eh, monsieur," said Vatel,
shrinking from monseigneur to monsieur with a degree of disdain:
"your cellar is so well stocked that when certain of your guests
dine with you they have nothing to drink."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Fouquet, in great surprise,
looked at Gourville.  "What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I mean that your butler had
not wine for all tastes, monsieur; and that M. de la Fontaine, M.
P&eacute;lisson, and M. Conrart, do not drink when they come to
the house - these gentlemen do not like strong wine.  What is to
be done, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, and therefore?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, then, I have found
here a <i>vin de Joigny</i>, which they like.  I know they come
here once a week to drink at the Image-de-Notre-Dame.  That is
the reason I am making this provision."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Fouquet had no more to say;
he was convinced.  Vatel, on his part, had much more to say,
without doubt, and it was plain he was getting warm.  "It is just
as if you would reproach me, monseigneur, for going to the Rue
Planche Milbray, to fetch, myself, the cider M. Loret drinks when
he comes to dine at your house."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Loret drinks cider at my
house!" cried Fouquet, laughing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Certainly he does,
monsieur, and that is the reason why he dines there with
pleasure."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Vatel," cried Fouquet,
pressing the hand of his <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>, "you
are a man!  I thank you, Vatel, for having understood that at my
house M. de la Fontaine, M. Conrart, and M. Loret are as great as
dukes and peers, as great as princes, greater than myself. 
Vatel, you are a good servant, and I double your salary."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Vatel did not even thank his
master, he merely shrugged his shoulders a little, murmuring this
superb sentiment: "To be thanked for having done one's duty is
humiliating."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He is right," said
Gourville, as he drew Fouquet's attention, by a gesture, to
another point.  He showed him a low-built tumbrel, drawn by two
horses, upon which rocked two strong gibbets, bound together,
back to back, by chains, whilst an archer, seated upon the
cross-beam, suffered, as well as he could, with his head cast
down, the comments of a hundred vagabonds, who guessed the
destination of the gibbets, and were escorting them to the
H&ocirc;tel de Ville.  Fouquet started.  "It is decided, you
see," said Gourville.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But it is not done,"
replied Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, do not flatter
yourself, monseigneur; if they have thus lulled your friendship
and suspicions - if things have gone so far, you will be able to
undo nothing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But I have not given my
sanction."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "M. de Lyonne has ratified
for you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I will go to the
Louvre."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, no, you will not."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Would you advise such
baseness?" cried Fouquet, "would you advise me to abandon my
friends? would you advise me, whilst able to fight, to throw the
arms I hold in my hand to the ground?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I do not advise you to do
anything of the kind, monseigneur.  Are you in a position to quit
the post of superintendent at this moment?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, if the king wishes to
displace you - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He will displace me absent
as well as present."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, but you will not have
insulted him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, but I shall have been
base; now I am not willing that my friends should die; and they
shall <i>not</i> die!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "For that it is necessary
you should go to the Louvre, is it not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Gourville!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Beware! once at the Louvre,
you will be forced to defend your friends openly, that is to say,
to make a profession of faith; or you will be forced to abandon
them irrevocably."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Never!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Pardon me; - the king will
propose the alternative to you, rigorously, or else you will
propose it to him yourself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is true."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is the reason why
conflict must be avoided.  Let us return to Saint-Mand&eacute;,
monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Gourville, I will not stir
from this place, where the crime is to be carried out, where my
disgrace is to be accomplished; I will not stir, I say, till I
have found some means of combating my enemies."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monseigneur," replied
Gourville, "you would excite my pity, if I did not know you for
one of the great spirits of this world.  You possess a hundred
and fifty millions, you are equal to the king in position, and a
hundred and fifty millions his superior in money.  M. Colbert has
not even had the wit to have the will of Mazarin accepted.  Now,
when a man is the richest person in a kingdom, and will take the
trouble to spend the money, if things are done he does not like,
it is because he is a poor man.  Let us return to
Saint-Mand&eacute;, I say."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To consult with
P&eacute;lisson? - we will."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, monseigneur, to count
your money."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So be it," said Fouquet,
with angry eyes; - "yes, yes, to Saint-Mand&eacute;!"  He got
into his carriage again, and Gourville with him.  Upon their
road, at the end of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, they overtook the
humble equipage of Vatel, who was quietly conveying home his
<i>vin de Joigny</i>.  The black horses, going at a swift pace,
alarmed, as they passed, the timid hack of the <i>ma&icirc;tre
d'h&ocirc;tel</i>, who, putting his head out at the window,
cried, in a fright, "Take care of my bottles!"

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>F</span>ifty persons
were waiting for the superintendent.  He did not even take the
time to place himself in the hands of his <i>valet de chambre</i>
for a minute, but from the <i>perron</i> went straight into the
<i>premier salon</i>.  There his friends were assembled in full
chat.  The intendant was about to order supper to be served, but,
above all, the Abb&eacute; Fouquet watched for the return of his
brother, and was endeavoring to do the honors of the house in his
absence.  Upon the arrival of the superintendent, a murmur of joy
and affection was heard; Fouquet, full of affability, good humor,
and munificence, was beloved by his poets, his artists, and his
men of business.  His brow, upon which his little court read, as
upon that of a god, all the movements of his soul, and thence
drew rules of conduct, - his brow, upon which affairs of state
never impressed a wrinkle, was this evening paler than usual, and
more than one friendly eye remarked that pallor.  Fouquet placed
himself at the head of the table, and presided gayly during
supper.  He recounted Vatel's expedition to La Fontaine, he
related the history of Menneville and the skinny fowl to
P&eacute;lisson, in such a manner that all the table heard it.  A
tempest of laughter and jokes ensued, which was only checked by a
serious and even sad gesture from P&eacute;lisson.  The
Abb&eacute; Fouquet, not being able to comprehend why his brother
should have led the conversation in that direction, listened with
all his ears, and sought in the countenance of Gourville, or in
that of his brother, an explanation which nothing afforded him. 
P&eacute;lisson took up the matter: - "Did they mention M.
Colbert, then?" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why not?" replied Fouquet;
"if true, as it is said to be, that the king has made him his
intendant?"  Scarcely had Fouquet uttered these words, with a
marked intention, than an explosion broke forth among the
guests.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The miser!" said one.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The mean, pitiful fellow!"
said another.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The hypocrite!" said a
third.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                P&eacute;lisson exchanged a
meaning look with Fouquet.  "Messieurs," said he, "in truth we
are abusing a man whom no one knows: it is neither charitable nor
reasonable; and here is monsieur le surintendant, who, I am sure,
agrees with me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Entirely," replied
Fouquet.  "Let the fat fowls of M. Colbert alone; our business
to-day is with the <i>faisans truff&eacute;s</i> of M. Vatel." 
This speech stopped the dark cloud which was beginning to throw
its shade over the guests.  Gourville succeeded so well in
animating the poets with the <i>vin de Joigny</i>; the
abb&eacute;, intelligent as a man who stands in need of his
host's money, so enlivened the financiers and the men of the
sword, that, amidst the vapors of this joy and the noise of
conversation, inquietudes disappeared completely.  The will of
Cardinal Mazarin was the text of the conversation at the second
course and dessert; then Fouquet ordered bowls of sweetmeats and
fountains of liquor to be carried into the <i>salon</i> adjoining
the gallery.  He led the way thither, conducting by the hand a
lady, the queen, by his preference, of the evening.  The
musicians then supped, and the promenades in the gallery and the
gardens commenced, beneath a spring sky, mild and
flower-scented.  P&eacute;lisson then approached the
superintendent, and said: "Something troubles monseigneur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Greatly," replied the
minister; "ask Gourville to tell you what it is." 
P&eacute;lisson, on turning round, found La Fontaine treading
upon his heels.  He was obliged to listen to a Latin verse, which
the poet had composed upon Vatel.  La Fontaine had, for an hour,
been scanning this verse in all corners, seeking some one to pour
it out upon advantageously.  He thought he had caught
P&eacute;lisson, but the latter escaped him; he turned towards
Sorel, who had, himself, just composed a <i>quatrain</i> in honor
of the supper, and the <i>Amphytrion</i>.  La Fontaine in vain
endeavored to gain attention to his verses; Sorel wanted to
obtain a hearing for his <i>quatrain</i>.  He was obliged to
retreat before M. le Comte de Charost, whose arm Fouquet had just
taken.  L'Abb&eacute; Fouquet perceived that the poet,
absent-minded, as usual, was about to follow the two talkers; and
he interposed.  La Fontaine seized upon him, and recited his
verses.  The abb&eacute;, who was quite innocent of Latin, nodded
his head, in cadence, at every roll which La Fontaine impressed
upon his body, according to the undulations of the dactyls and
spondees.  While this was going on, behind the confiture-basins,
Fouquet related the event of the day to his son-in-law, M. de
Charost.  "We will send the idle and useless to look at the
fireworks," said P&eacute;lisson to Gourville, "whilst we
converse here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So be it," said Gourville,
addressing four words to Vatel.  The latter then led towards the
gardens the major part of the beaux, the ladies and the
chatterers, whilst the men walked in the gallery, lighted by
three hundred wax-lights, in the sight of all; the admirers of
fireworks all ran away towards the garden.  Gourville approached
Fouquet, and said: "Monsieur, we are here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "All?" said Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, - count."  The
superintendent counted; there were eight persons. 
P&eacute;lisson and Gourville walked arm in arm, as if conversing
upon vague and frivolous subjects.  Sorel and two officers
imitated them, and in an opposite direction.  The Abb&eacute;
Fouquet walked alone.  Fouquet, with M. de Charost, walked as if
entirely absorbed in the conversation of his son-in-law. 
"Messieurs," said he, "let no one of you raise his head as he
walks, or appear to pay attention to me; continue walking, we are
alone, listen to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                A perfect silence ensued,
disturbed only by the distant cries of the joyous guests, from
the groves whence they beheld the fireworks. It was a whimsical
spectacle this, of these men walking in groups, as if each one
was occupied about something, whilst lending attention really
only to one amongst them, who, himself, seemed to be speaking
only to his companion.  "Messieurs," said Fouquet, "you have,
without doubt, remarked the absence of two of my friends this
evening, who were with us on Wednesday.  For God's sake,
abb&eacute;, do not stop, - it is not necessary to enable you to
listen; walk on, carrying your head in a natural way, and as you
have excellent sight, place yourself at the window, and if any
one returns towards the gallery, give us notice by coughing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The abb&eacute; obeyed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have not observed their
absence," said P&eacute;lisson, who, at this moment, was turning
his back to Fouquet, and walking the other way.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I do not see M. Lyodot,"
said Sorel, "who pays me my pension."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And I," said the
abb&eacute;, at the window, "do not see M. d'Eymeris, who owes me
eleven hundred livres from our last game of brelan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sorel," continued Fouquet,
walking bent, and gloomily, "you will never receive your pension
any more from M. Lyodot; and you, abb&eacute;, will never be paid
you eleven hundred livres by M. d'Eymeris; for both are doomed to
die."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To die!" exclaimed the
whole assembly, arrested, in spite of themselves, in the comedy
they were playing, by that terrible word.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Recover yourselves,
messieurs," said Fouquet, "for perhaps we are watched - I said:
to die!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To die!" repeated
P&eacute;lisson; "what, the men I saw six days ago, full of
health, gayety, and the spirit of the future!  What then is man,
good God! that disease should thus bring him down all at
once!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is not a disease," said
Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then there is a remedy,"
said Sorel.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No remedy.  Messieurs de
Lyodot and D'Eymeris are on the eve of their last day."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Of what are these gentlemen
dying, then?" asked an officer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ask of him who kills them,"
replied Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who kills them?  Are they
being killed, then?" cried the terrified chorus.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "They do better still; the
are hanging them," murmured Fouquet, in a sinister voice, which
sounded like a funeral knell in that rich gallery, splendid with
pictures, flowers, velvet, and gold.  Involuntarily every one
stopped; the abb&eacute; quitted his window; the first fuses of
the fireworks began to mount above the trees.  A prolonged cry
from the gardens attracted the superintendent to enjoy the
spectacle.  He drew near to a window, and his friends placed
themselves behind him, attentive to his least wish.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Messieurs," said
he, "M. Colbert has caused to be arrested, tried and will execute
my two friends; what does it become me to do?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Mordieu!</i>" exclaimed
the abb&eacute;, the first one to speak, "run M. Colbert through
the body."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monseigneur," said
P&eacute;lisson, "you must speak to his majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The king, my dear
P&eacute;lisson, himself signed the order for the execution."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well!" said the Comte de
Charost, "the execution must not take place, then; that is
all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Impossible," said
Gourville, "unless we could corrupt the jailers."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Or the governor," said
Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This night the prisoners
might be allowed to escape."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Which of you will take
charge of the transaction?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I," said the abb&eacute;,
"will carry the money."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And I," said
P&eacute;lisson, "will be the bearer of the words."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Words and money," said
Fouquet, "five hundred thousand livres to the governor of the
<i>conciergerie</i>, that is sufficient; nevertheless, it shall
be a million, if necessary."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>               </i> "A million!" cried
the abb&eacute;; "why, for less than half, I would have half
Paris sacked."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "There must be no disorder,"
said P&eacute;lisson.  "The governor being gained, the two
prisoners escape; once clear of the fangs of the law, they will
call together the enemies of Colbert, and prove to the king that
his young justice, like all other monstrosities, is not
infallible."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Go to Paris, then,
P&eacute;lisson," said Fouquet, "and bring hither the two
victims; to-morrow we shall see."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Gourville gave
P&eacute;lisson the five hundred thousand livres.  "Take care the
wind does not carry you away," said the abb&eacute;; "what a
responsibility.  <i>Peste!</i>  Let me help you a little."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Silence!" said Fouquet,
"somebody is coming.  Ah! the fireworks are producing a magical
effect."  At this moment a shower of sparks fell rustling among
the branches of the neighboring trees.  P&eacute;lisson and
Gourville went out together by the door of the gallery; Fouquet
descended to the garden with the five last plotters.</p>

giving, or appearing to give, all his attention to the brilliant
illuminations, the languishing music of the violins and hautboys,
the sparkling sheaves of the artificial fires, which, inflaming
the heavens with glowing reflections, marked behind the trees the
dark profile of the donjon of Vincennes; as, we say, the
superintendent was smiling on the ladies and the poets, the
<i>f&ecirc;te</i> was every whit as gay as usual; and Vatel,
whose restless, even jealous look, earnestly consulted the aspect
of Fouquet, did not appear dissatisfied with the welcome given to
the ordering of the evening's entertainment.  The fireworks over,
the company dispersed about the gardens and beneath the marble
porticoes with the delightful liberty which reveals in the master
of the house so much forgetfulness of greatness, so much
courteous hospitality, so much magnificent carelessness.  The
poets wandered about, arm in arm, through the groves; some
reclined upon beds of moss, to the great damage of velvet clothes
and curled heads, into which little dried leaves and blades of
grass insinuated themselves.  The ladies, in small numbers,
listened to the songs of the singers and the verses of the poets;
others listened to the prose, spoken with much art, by men who
were neither actors nor poets, but to whom youth and solitude
gave an unaccustomed eloquence, which appeared to them better
than everything else in the world.  "Why," said La Fontaine,
"does not our master Epicurus descend into the garden?  Epicurus
never abandoned his pupils; the master is wrong."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," said Conrart,
"you yourself are in the wrong persisting in decorating yourself
with the name of an Epicurean; indeed, nothing here reminds me of
the doctrine of the philosopher of Gargetta."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bah!" said La Fontaine, "is
it not written that Epicurus purchased a large garden and lived
in it tranquilly with his friends?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is true."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, has not M. Fouquet
purchased a large garden at Saint-Mand&eacute;, and do we not
live here very tranquilly with him and his friends?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, without doubt;
unfortunately it is neither the garden nor the friends which
constitute the resemblance.  Now, what likeness is there between
the doctrine of Epicurus and that of M. Fouquet?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This - pleasure gives
happiness."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Next?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, I do not think we
ought to consider ourselves unfortunate, for my part, at least. 
A good repast - <i>vin de Joigny</i>, which they have the
delicacy to go and fetch for me from my favorite <i>cabaret</i> -
not one impertinence heard during a supper an hour long, in spite
of the presence of ten millionaires and twenty poets."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I stop you there.  You
mentioned <i>vin de Joigny</i>, and a good repast; do you persist
in that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I persist, - <i>anteco</i>,
as they say at Port Royal."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then please to recollect
that the great Epicurus lived, and made his pupils live, upon
bread, vegetables, and water."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is not certain," said
La Fontaine; "and you appear to me to be confounding Epicurus
with Pythagoras, my dear Conrart."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Remember, likewise, that
the ancient philosopher was rather a bad friend of the gods and
the magistrates."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! that is what I will not
admit," replied La Fontaine.  "Epicurus was like M. Fouquet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do not compare him to
monsieur le surintendant," said Conrart, in an agitated voice,
"or you would accredit the reports which are circulating
concerning him and us."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What reports?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That we are bad Frenchmen,
lukewarm with regard to the king, deaf to the law."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I return, then, to my
text," said La Fontaine.  "Listen, Conrart, this is the morality
of Epicurus, whom, besides, I consider, if I must tell you so, as
a myth.  Antiquity is mostly mythical.  Jupiter, if we give a
little attention to it, is life.  Alcides is strength.  The words
are there to bear me out; Zeus, that is, <i>zen</i>, to live. 
Alcides, that is, <i>alc&eacute;</i>, vigor.  Well, Epicurus,
that is mild watchfulness, that is protection; now who watches
better over the state, or who protects individuals better than M.
Fouquet does?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You talk etymology and not
morality; I say that we modern Epicureans are indifferent
citizens."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!" cried La Fontaine," if
we become bad citizens, it is not through following the maxims of
our master.  Listen to one of his principal aphorisms."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I - will."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Pray for good leaders."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well! what does M. Fouquet
say to us every day?  'When shall we be governed?'  Does he say
so?  Come, Conrart, be frank."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He says so, that is
true."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, that is a doctrine of
Epicurus."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes; but that is a little
seditious, observe."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What! seditious to wish to
be governed by good heads or leaders?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Certainly, when those who
govern are bad."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Patience, I have a reply
for all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Even for what I have just
said to you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Listen! would you submit to
those who govern ill?  Oh! it is written: <i>Cac&ocirc;s
politeuousi</i>.  You grant me the text?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Pardieu!</i>  I think
so.  Do you know, you speak Greek as well as &AElig;sop did, my
dear La Fontaine."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is there any wickedness in
that, my dear Conrart?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "God forbid I should say
so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then let us return to M.
Fouquet.  What did he repeat to us all the day?  Was it not
this?  'What a <i>cuistre</i> is that Mazarin! what an ass! what
a leech!  We must, however, submit to that fellow.'  Now,
Conrart, did he say so, or did he not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I confess that he said it,
and even perhaps too often."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Like Epicurus, my friend,
still like Epicurus; I repeat, we are Epicureans, and that is
very amusing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes; but I am afraid there
will rise up, by the side of us, a sect like that of Epictetus;
you know him well; the philosopher of Hierapolis, he who called
bread luxury, vegetables prodigality, and clear water
drunkenness; he who, being beaten by his master, said to him,
grumbling a little it is true, but without being angry, 'I will
lay a wager you have broken my leg!' - and who won his
wager."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He was a goose, that fellow
Epictetus."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Granted, but he might
easily become the fashion by only changing his name into that of
Colbert."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bah!" replied La Fontaine,
"that is impossible.  Never will you find Colbert in
Epictetus."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are right, I shall find
- <i>Coluber</i> there, at the most."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! you are beaten,
Conrart; you are reduced to a play upon words.  M. Arnaud
pretends that I have no logic; I have more than M. Nicole."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes," replied Conrart, "you
have logic, but you are a Jansenist."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This peroration was hailed
with a boisterous shout of laughter; by degrees the promenaders
had been attracted by the exclamations of the two disputants
around the arbor under which they were arguing.  The discussion
had been religiously listened to, and Fouquet himself, scarcely
able to suppress his laughter, had given an example of
moderation.  But with the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> of the scene
he threw off all restraint, and laughed aloud.  Everybody laughed
as he did, and the two philosophers were saluted with unanimous
felicitations.  La Fontaine, however, was declared conqueror, on
account of his profound erudition and his irrefragable logic. 
Conrart obtained the compensation due to an unsuccessful
combatant; he was praised for the loyalty of his intentions, and
the purity of his conscience.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                At the moment when this
jollity was manifesting itself by the most lively demonstrations,
when the ladies were reproaching the two adversaries with not
having admitted women into the system of Epicurean happiness,
Gourville was seen hastening from the other end of the garden,
approaching Fouquet, and detaching him, by his presence alone,
from the group.  The superintendent preserved on his face the
smile and character of carelessness; but scarcely was he out of
sight than he threw off the mask.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well!" said he, eagerly,
"where is P&eacute;lisson!  What is he doing?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "P&eacute;lisson has
returned from Paris."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Has he brought back the
prisoners?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He has not even seen the
<i>concierge</i> of the prison."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What! did he not tell him
he came from me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He told him so, but the
<i>concierge</i> sent him this reply: 'If any one came to me from
M. Fouquet, he would have a letter from M. Fouquet.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!" cried the latter, "if
a letter is all he wants - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is useless, monsieur!"
said P&eacute;lisson, showing himself at the corner of the little
wood, "useless!  Go yourself, and speak in your own name."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are right.  I will go
in, as if to work; let the horses remain harnessed,
P&eacute;lisson.  Entertain my friends, Gourville."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "One last word of advice,
monseigneur," replied the latter.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Speak, Gourville."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do not go to the
<i>concierge</i> save at the last minute; it is brave, but it is
not wise.  Excuse me, Monsieur P&eacute;lisson, if I am not of
the same opinion as you; but take my advice, monseigneur, send
again a message to this <i>concierge</i>, - he is a worthy man,
but do not carry it yourself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I will think of it," said
Fouquet; "besides, we have all the night before us."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do not reckon too much on
time; were the hours we have twice as many as they are, they
would not be too much," replied P&eacute;lisson; "it is never a
fault to arrive too soon."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Adieu!" said the
superintendent; "come with me, P&eacute;lisson.  Gourville, I
commend my guests to your care."  And he set off.  The Epicureans
did not perceive that the head of the school had left them; the
violins continued playing all night long.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=

leaving his house for the second time that day, felt himself less
heavy and less disturbed than might have been expected.  He
turned towards P&eacute;lisson, who was meditating in the corner
of the carriage some good arguments against the violent
proceedings of Colbert.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My dear P&eacute;lisson,"
said Fouquet, "it is a great pity you are not a woman."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I think, on the contrary,
it is very fortunate," replied P&eacute;lisson, "for,
monseigneur, I am excessively ugly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "P&eacute;lisson! 
P&eacute;lisson!" said the superintendent, laughing: "You repeat
too often, you are 'ugly', not to leave people to believe that it
gives you much pain."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In fact it does,
monseigneur, much pain; there is no man more unfortunate than I:
I was handsome, the small-pox rendered me hideous; I am deprived
of a great means of attraction; now, I am your principal clerk,
or something of that sort; I take great interest in your affairs,
and if, at this moment, I were a pretty woman, I could render you
an important service."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I would go and find the
<i>concierge</i> of the Palais.  I would seduce him, for he is a
gallant man, extravagantly partial to women; then I would get
away our two prisoners."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I hope to be able to do so
myself, although I am not a pretty woman," replied Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Granted, monseigneur; but
you are compromising yourself very much."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!" cried Fouquet,
suddenly, with one of those secret transports which the generous
blood of youth, or the remembrance of some sweet emotion, infuses
into the heart.  "Oh!  I know a woman who will enact the
personage we stand in need of, with the lieutenant-governor of
the <i>concierge</i>."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And, on my part, I know
fifty, monseigneur; fifty trumpets, which will inform the
universe of your generosity, of your devotion to your friends,
and, consequently, will ruin you sooner or later in ruining
themselves."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I do not speak of such
women, P&eacute;lisson; I speak of a noble and beautiful creature
who joins to the intelligence and wit of her sex the valor and
coolness of ours; I speak of a woman, handsome enough to make the
walls of a prison bow down to salute her, discreet enough to let
no one suspect by whom she has been sent."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A treasure!" said
P&eacute;lisson; "you would make a famous present to monsieur the
governor of the <i>concierge!  Peste!</i> monseigneur, he might
have his head cut off; but he would, before dying, have had such
happiness as no man had enjoyed before him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And I add," said Fouquet,
"that the <i>concierge</i> of the Palais would not have his head
cut off, for he would receive of me my horses, to effect his
escape, and five hundred thousand livres wherewith to live
comfortably in England: I add, that this lady, my friend, would
give him nothing but the horses and the money.  Let us go and
seek her, P&eacute;lisson."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The superintendent reached
forth his hand towards the golden and silken cord placed in the
interior of his carriage, but P&eacute;lisson stopped him. 
"Monseigneur," said he, "you are going to lose as much time in
seeking this lady as Columbus took to discover the new world. 
Now, we have but two hours in which we can possibly succeed; the
<i>concierge</i> once gone to bed, how shall we get at him
without making a disturbance?  When daylight dawns, how can we
conceal our proceedings?  Go, go yourself, monseigneur, and do
not seek either woman or angel to-night."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But, my dear
P&eacute;lisson, here we are before her door."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What! before the angel's
door?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This is the hotel of Madame
de Belli&egrave;re!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Hush!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah!  Good Lord!" exclaimed
P&eacute;lisson.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What have you to say
against her?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Nothing, alas! and it is
that which causes my despair.  Nothing, absolutely nothing.  Why
can I not, on the contrary, say ill enough of her to prevent your
going to her?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                But Fouquet had already
given orders to stop, and the carriage was motionless.  "Prevent
me!" cried Fouquet; "why, no power on earth should prevent my
going to pay my compliments to Madame de Plessis-Belli&egrave;re;
besides, who knows that we shall not stand in need of her!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, monseigneur, no!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But I do not wish you to
wait for me, P&eacute;lisson," replied Fouquet, sincerely
courteous.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The more reason I should,
monseigneur; knowing that you are keeping me waiting, you will,
perhaps, stay a shorter time.  Take care!  You see there is a
carriage in the courtyard: she has some one with her."  Fouquet
leaned towards the steps of the carriage.  "One word more," cried
P&eacute;lisson; "do not go to this lady till you have been to
the <i>concierge</i>, for Heaven's sake!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eh! five minutes,
P&eacute;lisson," replied Fouquet, alighting at the steps of the
hotel, leaving P&eacute;lisson in the carriage, in a very
ill-humor.  Fouquet ran upstairs, told his name to the footman,
which excited an eagerness and a respect that showed the habit
the mistress of the house had of honoring that name in her
family.  "Monsieur le surintendant," cried the marquise,
advancing, very pale, to meet him; "what an honor! what an
unexpected pleasure!" said she.  Then, in a low voice, "Take
care!" added the marquise, "Marguerite Vanel is here!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Madame," replied Fouquet,
rather agitated, "I came on business.  One single word, and
quickly, if you please!"  And he entered the <i>salon</i>. 
Madame Vanel had risen, paler, more livid, than Envy herself. 
Fouquet in vain addressed her, with the most agreeable, most
pacific salutation; she only replied by a terrible glance darted
at the marquise and Fouquet.  This keen glance of a jealous woman
is a stiletto which pierces every cuirass; Marguerite Vanel
plunged it straight into the hearts of the two confidants.  She
made a courtesy to <i>her friend</i>, a more profound one to
Fouquet, and took leave, under pretense of having a number of
visits to make, without the marquise trying to prevent her, or
Fouquet, a prey to anxiety, thinking further about her.  She was
scarcely out of the room, and Fouquet left alone with the
marquise, before he threw himself on his knees, without saying a
word.  "I expected you," said the marquise, with a tender
sigh.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! no," cried he, "or you
would have sent away that woman."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "She has been here little
more than half an hour, and I had no expectation she would come
this evening."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You love me just a little,
then, marquise?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is not the question
now; it is of your danger; how are your affairs going on?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am going this evening to
get my friends out of the prisons of the Palais."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How will you do that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "By buying and bribing the
governor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He is a friend of mine; can
I assist you, without injuring you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! marquise, it would be a
signal service; but how can you be employed without your being
compromised?  Now, never shall my life, my power, or even my
liberty, be purchased at the expense of a single tear from your
eyes, or of one frown of pain upon your brow."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monseigneur, no more such
words, they bewilder me; I have been culpable in trying to serve
you, without calculating the extent of what I was doing.  I love
you in reality, as a tender friend; and as a friend, I am
grateful for your delicate attentions - but, alas! - alas! you
will never find a mistress in me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Marquise!" cried Fouquet,
in a tone of despair; "why not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Because you are too much
beloved," said the young woman, in a low voice; "because you are
too much beloved by too many people - because the splendor of
glory and fortune wound my eyes, whilst the darkness of sorrow
attracts them; because, in short, I, who have repulsed you in
your proud magnificence; I who scarcely looked at you in your
splendor, I came, like a mad woman, to throw myself, as it were,
into your arms, when I saw a misfortune hovering over your head. 
You understand me now, monseigneur?  Become happy again, that I
may remain chaste in heart and in thought: your misfortune
entails my ruin."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! madame," said Fouquet,
with an emotion he had never before felt; "were I to fall to the
lowest degree of human misery, and hear from your mouth that word
which you now refuse me, that day, madame, you will be mistaken
in your noble egotism; that day you will fancy you are consoling
the most unfortunate of men, and you will have said, <i>I love
you</i>, to the most illustrious, the most delighted, the most
triumphant of the happy beings of this world."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                He was still at her feet,
kissing her hand, when P&eacute;lisson entered precipitately,
crying, in very ill-humor, "Monseigneur! madame! for Heaven's
sake! excuse me.  Monseigneur, you have been here half an hour. 
Oh! do not both look at me so reproachfully.  Madame, pray who is
that lady who left your house soon after monseigneur came
in?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Madame Vanel," said
Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ha!" cried P&eacute;lisson,
"I was sure of that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well! what then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, she got into her
carriage, looking deadly pale."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What consequence is that to
me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, but what she said to
her coachman is of consequence to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Kind heaven!" cried the
marquise, "what was that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To M. Colbert's!" said
P&eacute;lisson, in a hoarse voice.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Bon Dieu!</i> - begone,
begone, monseigneur!" replied the marquise, pushing Fouquet out
of the <i>salon</i>, whilst P&eacute;lisson dragged him by the
hand.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Am I, then, indeed," said
the superintendent, "become a child, to be frightened by a
shadow?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are a giant," said the
marquise, "whom a viper is trying to bite in the heel."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                P&eacute;lisson continued to
drag Fouquet to the carriage.  "To the Palais at full speed!"
cried P&eacute;lisson to the coachman.  The horses set off like
lightening; no obstacle relaxed their pace for an instant.  Only,
at the arcade Saint-Jean, as they were coming out upon the Place
de Gr&egrave;ve, a long file of horsemen, barring the narrow
passage, stopped the carriage of the superintendent.  There was
no means of forcing this barrier; it was necessary to wait till
the mounted archers of the watch, for it was they who stopped the
way, had passed with the heavy carriage they were escorting, and
which ascended rapidly towards the Place Baudoyer.  Fouquet and
P&eacute;lisson took no further account of this circumstance
beyond deploring the minute's delay they had thus to submit to. 
They entered the habitation of the <i>concierge du Palais</i>
five minutes after.  That officer was still walking about in the
front court.  At the name of Fouquet, whispered in his ear by
P&eacute;lisson, the governor eagerly approached the carriage,
and, hat in hand, was profuse in his attentions.  "What an honor
for me, monseigneur," said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "One word, monsieur le
governeur, will you take the trouble to get into my carriage?" 
The officer placed himself opposite Fouquet in the coach.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," said Fouquet, "I
have a service to ask of you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Speak, monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A service that will be
compromising for you, monsieur, but which will assure to you
forever my protection and my friendship."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Were it to cast myself into
the fire for you, monseigneur, I would do it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is well," said
Fouquet; "what I require is much more simple."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That being so, monseigneur,
what is it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To conduct me to the
chamber of Messieurs Lyodot and D'Eymeris."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Will monseigneur have the
kindness to say for what purpose?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I will tell you that in
their presence, monsieur; at the same time that I will give you
ample means of palliating this escape."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Escape!  Why, then,
monseigneur does not know?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That Messieurs Lyodot and
D'Eymeris are no longer here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Since when?" cried Fouquet,
in great agitation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "About a quarter of an
hour."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Whither have they gone,
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To Vincennes - to the
donjon."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who took them from
here?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "An order from the
king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! woe! woe!" exclaimed
Fouquet, striking his forehead.  "Woe!" and without saying a
single word more to the governor, he threw himself back into his
carriage, despair in his heart, and death on his countenance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well!" said
P&eacute;lisson, with great anxiety.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Our friends are lost. 
Colbert is conveying them to the donjon.  They crossed our path
under the arcade Saint-Jean."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                P&eacute;lisson, struck as
by a thunderbolt, made no reply.  With a single reproach he would

already far advanced when the Abb&eacute; Fouquet joined his
brother.  Gourville had accompanied him.  These three men, pale
with dread of future events, resembled less three powers of the
day than three conspirators, united by one single thought of
violence.  Fouquet walked for a long time, with his eyes fixed
upon the floor, striking his hands one against the other.  At
length, taking courage, in the midst of a deep sigh:
"Abb&eacute;," said he, "you were speaking to me only to-day of
certain people you maintain."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur," replied the
abb&eacute;.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Tell me precisely who are
these people."  The abb&eacute; hesitated.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Come! no fear, I am not
threatening; no romancing, for I am not joking."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Since you demand the truth,
monseigneur, here it is: - I have a hundred and twenty friends or
companions of pleasure, who are sworn to me as the thief is to
the gallows."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you think you can
depend on them?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Entirely."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you will not compromise
yourself?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I will not even make my
appearance."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Are they men of
resolution?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "They would burn Paris, if I
promised them they should not be burnt in turn."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The thing I ask of you,
abb&eacute;," said Fouquet, wiping the sweat which fell from his
brow, "is to throw your hundred and twenty men upon the people I
will point out to you, at a certain moment given - is it
possible?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It will not be the first
time such a thing has happened to them, monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is well: but would
these bandits attack an armed force?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "They are used to that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then get your hundred and
twenty men together, abb&eacute;."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Directly.  But where?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "On the road to Vincennes,
to-morrow, at two o'clock precisely."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To carry off Lyodot and
D'Eymeris?  There will be blows to be got!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A number, no doubt; are you
afraid?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Not for myself, but for
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your men will know, then,
what they have to do?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "They are too intelligent
not to guess it.  Now, a minister who gets up a riot against his
king - exposes himself - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Of what importance is that
to you, I pray?  Besides, if I fall, you fall with me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It would then be more
prudent, monsieur, not to stir in the affair, and leave the king
to take this little satisfaction."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Think well of this,
abb&eacute;, Lyodot and D'Eymeris at Vincennes are a prelude of
ruin for my house.  I repeat it - I arrested, you will be
imprisoned - I imprisoned, you will be exiled."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, I am at your
orders; have you any to give me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What I told you - I wish
that, to-morrow, the two financiers of whom they mean to make
victims, whilst there remain so many criminals unpunished, should
be snatched from the fury of my enemies.  Take your measures
accordingly.  Is it possible?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is possible."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Describe your plan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is of rich simplicity. 
The ordinary guard at executions consists of twelve archers."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "There will be a hundred
to-morrow."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I reckon so.  I even say
more - there will be two hundred."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then your hundred and
twenty men will not be enough."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Pardon me.  In every crowd
composed of a hundred thousand spectators, there are ten thousand
bandits or cut-purses - only they dare not take the
initiative."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "There will then be,
to-morrow, on the Place de Gr&egrave;ve, which I choose as my
battle-field, ten thousand auxiliaries to my hundred and twenty
men.  The attack commenced by the latter, the others will finish
it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That all appears feasible. 
But what will be done with regard to the prisoners upon the Place
de Gr&egrave;ve?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This: they must be thrust
into some house - that will make a siege necessary to get them
out again.  And stop! here is another idea, more sublime still:
certain houses have two issues - one upon the Place, and the
other into the Rue de la Mortellerie, or la Vannerie, or la
Tixeranderie.  The prisoners entering by one door will go out at
another."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes; but fix upon something
positive."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am seeking to do so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And I," cried Fouquet, "I
have found it.  Listen to what has occurred to me at this
moment."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am listening."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Fouquet made a sign to
Gourville, who appeared to understand.  "One of my friends lends
me sometimes the keys of a house which he rents, Rue Baudoyer,
the spacious gardens of which extend behind a certain house on
the Place de Gr&egrave;ve."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is the place for us,"
said the abb&eacute;.  "What house?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A <i>cabaret</i>, pretty
well frequented, whose sign represents the image of Notre
Dame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I know it," said the
abb&eacute;.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This <i>cabaret</i> has
windows opening upon the Place, a place of exit into the court,
which must abut upon the gardens of my friend by a door of
communication."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good!" said the
abb&eacute;.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Enter by the
<i>cabaret</i>, take the prisoners in; defend the door while you
enable them to fly by the garden and the Place Baudoyer."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is all plain. 
Monsieur, you would make an excellent general, like monsieur le
prince."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Have you understood
me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Perfectly well."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How much will it amount to,
to make your bandits all drunk with wine, and to satisfy them
with gold?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, monsieur, what an
expression!  Oh! monsieur, if they heard you! some of them are
very susceptible."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I mean to say they must be
brought to the point where they cannot tell the heavens from the
earth; for I shall to-morrow contend with the king; and when I
fight I mean to conquer - please to understand."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It shall be done,
monsieur.  Give me your other ideas."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is your business."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then give me your
purse."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Gourville, count a hundred
thousand livres for the abb&eacute;."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good! and spare nothing,
did you not say?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Nothing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is well."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monseigneur," objected
Gourville, "if this should be known, we should lose our
heads."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eh!  Gourville," replied
Fouquet, purple with anger, "you excite my pity.  Speak for
yourself, if you please.  My head does not shake in that manner
upon my shoulders.  Now, abb&eacute;, is everything
arranged?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Everything."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "At two o'clock
to-morrow."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "At twelve, because it will
be necessary to prepare our auxiliaries in a secret manner."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is true; do not spare
the wine of the <i>cabaretier</i>."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I will spare neither his
wine nor his house," replied the abb&eacute;, with a sneering
laugh.  "I have my plan, I tell you; leave me to set it in
operation, and you shall see."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Where shall you be
yourself?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Everywhere; nowhere."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And how shall I receive
information?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "By a courier whose horse
shall be kept in the very same garden of your friend.  <i>A

<p class="MsoNormal" style='punctuation-wrap:hanging'>
                Fouquet looked again at Gourville.  The latter
came to the succor of his master, saying, ["The name is of no
importance."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Fouquet continued,
"Accompany] monsieur l'abb&eacute;, for several reasons, but the
house is easily to be known - the 'Image-de-Notre-Dame' in the
front, a garden, the only one in the quarter, behind."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good, good!  I will go and
give notice to my soldiers."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Accompany him, Gourville,"
said Fouquet, "and count him down the money.  One moment,
abb&eacute; - one moment, Gourville - what name will be given to
this carrying off?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A very natural one,
monsieur - the Riot."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The riot on account of
what?  For, if ever the people of Paris are disposed to pay their
court to the king, it is when he hangs financiers."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I will manage that," said
the abb&eacute;.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes; but you may manage it
badly, and people will guess."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Not at all, - not at all. 
I have another idea."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What is that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My men shall cry out,
'<i>Colbert, vive Colbert!</i>' and shall throw themselves upon
the prisoners as if they would tear them in pieces, and shall
force them from the gibbets, as too mild a punishment."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! that is an idea," said
Gourville.  "<i>Peste!</i> monsieur l'abb&eacute;, what an
imagination you have!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, we are worthy of
our family," replied the abb&eacute;, proudly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Strange fellow," murmured
Fouquet.  Then he added, "That is ingenious.  Carry it out, but
shed no blood."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Gourville and the
abb&eacute; set off together, with their heads full of the
meditated riot.  The superintendent laid himself down upon some
cushions, half valiant with respect to the sinister projects of
the morrow, half dreaming of love.</p>

the next day fifty thousand spectators had taken their position
upon the Place, around the two gibbets which had been elevated
between the Quai de la Gr&egrave;ve and the Quai Pelletier; one
close to the other, with their backs to the embankment of the
river.  In the morning also, all the sworn criers of the good
city of Paris had traversed the quarters of the city,
particularly the <i>halles</i> and the <i>faubourgs</i>,
announcing with their hoarse and indefatigable voices the great
justice done by the king upon two speculators, two thieves,
devourers of the people.  And these people, whose interests were
so warmly looked after, in order not to fail in respect for their
king, quitted shops, stalls, and <i>atliers</i>, to go and evince
a little gratitude to Louis XIV., absolutely like invited guests,
who feared to commit an impoliteness in not repairing to the
house of him who had invited them.  According to the tenor of the
sentence, which the criers read aloud and incorrectly, two
farmers of the revenues, monopolists of money, dilapidators of
the royal provisions, extortioners, and forgers, were about to
undergo capital punishment on the Place de Gr&egrave;ve, with
their names blazoned over their heads, according to their
sentence.  As to those names, the sentence made no mention of
them.  The curiosity of the Parisians was at its height, and, as
we have said, an immense crowd waited with feverish impatience
the hour fixed for the execution.  The news had already spread
that the prisoners, transferred to the Ch&acirc;teau of
Vincennes, would be conducted from that prison to the Place de
Gr&egrave;ve.  Consequently, the faubourg and the Rue Saint
Antoine were crowded; for the population of Paris in those days
of great executions was divided into two categories: those who
came to see the condemned pass - these were of timid and mild
hearts, but philosophically curious - and those who wished to see
the condemned die - these had hearts that hungered for
sensation.  On this day M. d'Artagnan received his last
instructions from the king, and made his adieus to his friends,
the number of whom was, at the moment, reduced to Planchet; then
he traced the plan of his day, as every busy man whose moments
are counted ought to do, because he appreciates their
importance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My departure is to be,"
said he, "at break of day, three o'clock in the morning; I have
then fifteen hours before me.  Take from them the six hours of
sleep which are indispensable for me - six; one hour for repasts
- seven; one hour for a farewell visit to Athos - eight; two
hours for chance circumstances - total, ten.  There are then five
hours left.  One hour to get my money, - that is, to have payment
refused by M. Fouquet; another hour to go and receive my money of
M. Colbert, together with his questions and grimaces; one hour to
look over my clothes and arms, and get my boots cleaned.  I still
have two hours left.  <i>Mordioux!</i> how rich I am."  And so
saying, D'Artagnan felt a strange joy, a joy of youth, a perfume
of those great and happy years of former times mount into his
brain and intoxicate him.  "During these two hours I will go,"
said the musketeer, "and take my quarter's rent of the
Image-de-Notre-Dame.  That will be pleasant.  Three hundred and
seventy-five livres!  <i>Mordioux!</i> but that is astonishing! 
If the poor man who has but one livre in his pocket, found a
livre and twelve deniers, that would be justice, that would be
excellent; but never does such a godsend fall to the lot of the
poor man.  The rich man, on the contrary, makes himself revenue
with his money, which he does not even touch.  Here are three
hundred and seventy-five livres which fall to me from heaven.  I
will go then to the Image-de-Notre-Dame, and drink a glass of
Spanish wine with my tenant, which he cannot fail to offer me. 
But order must be observed, Monsieur d'Artagnan, order must be
observed!  Let us organize our time, then, and distribute the
employment of it!  Art. 1st, Athos; Art. 2d, the
Image-de-Notre-Dame; Art. 3rd, M. Fouquet; Art. 4th, M. Colbert;
Art. 5th, supper; Art. 6th, clothes, boots, horse, portmanteau;
Art. 7th and last, sleep."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                In consequence of this
arrangement, D'Artagnan went straight to the Comte de la
F&egrave;re, to whom, modestly and ingenuously, he related a part
of his fortunate adventures.  Athos had not been without
uneasiness on the subject of D'Artagnan's visit to the king; but
few words sufficed for an explanation of that.  Athos divined
that Louis had charged D'Artagnan with some important mission,
and did not even make an effort to draw the secret from him.  He
only recommended him to take care of himself, and offered
discreetly to accompany him if that were desirable.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But, my dear friend," said
D'Artagnan, " I am going nowhere."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What! you come and bid me
adieu, and are going nowhere?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! yes, yes," replied
D'Artagnan, coloring a little, "I am going to make an
acquisition."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is quite another
thing.  Then I change my formula.  Instead of 'Do not get
yourself killed,' I will say, - 'Do not get yourself
robbed.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My friend, I will inform
you if I set eyes on any property that pleases me, and shall
expect you will favor me with your opinion."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, yes," said Athos, too
delicate to permit himself even the consolation of a smile. 
Raoul imitated the paternal reserve.  But D'Artagnan thought it
would appear too mysterious to leave his friends under a
pretense, without even telling them the route he was about to
take."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have chosen Le Mans,"
said he to Athos.  "It is a good country?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Excellent, my friend,"
replied the count, without making him observe that Le Mans was in
the same directions as La Touraine, and that by waiting two days,
at most, he might travel with a friend.  But D'Artagnan, more
embarrassed than the count, dug, at every explanation, deeper
into the mud, into which he sank by degrees.  "I shall set out
to-morrow at daybreak," said he at last.  "Till that time, will
you come with me, Raoul?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur le
chevalier," said the young man, "if monsieur le comte does not
want me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, Raoul; I am to have an
audience to-day of Monsieur, the king's brother; that is all I
have to do."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Raoul asked Grimaud for his
sword, which the old man brought him immediately.  "Now then,"
added D'Artagnan, opening his arms to Athos, "adieu, my dear
friend!"  Athos held him in a long embrace, and the musketeer,
who knew his discretion so well, murmured in his ear - "An affair
of state," to which Athos only replied by a pressure of the hand,
still more significant.  They then separated.  Raoul took the arm
of his old friend, who led him along the Rue
Saint-Honor&eacute;.  "I an conducting you to the abode of the
god Plutus," said D'Artagnan to the young man; "prepare
yourself.  The whole day you will witness the piling up of
crowns.  Heavens! how I am changed!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! what numbers of people
there are in the street!" said Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is there a procession
to-day?" asked D'Artagnan of a passer-by.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, it is a hanging,"
replied the man.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What! a hanging at the
Gr&egrave;ve?" said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The devil take the rogue
who gets himself hung the day I want to go and take my rent!"
cried D'Artagnan.  "Raoul, did you ever see anybody hung?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Never, monsieur - thank
God!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! how young that sounds! 
If you were on guard in the trenches, as I was, and a spy!  But,
pardon me, Raoul, I am doting - you are quite right, it is a
hideous sight to see a person hung!  At what hour do they hang
them, monsieur, if you please?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," replied the
stranger respectfully, delighted at joining conversation with two
men of the sword, "it will take place at about three
o'clock."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Aha! it is now only
half-past one; let us step out, we shall be there in time to
touch my three hundred and seventy-five livres, and get away
before the arrival of the malefactor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Malefactors, monsieur,"
continued the <i>bourgeois</i>; "there are two of them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, I return to you
many thanks," said D'Artagnan, who as he grew older, had become
polite to a degree.  Drawing Raoul along, he directed his course
rapidly in the direction of La Gr&egrave;ve.  Without that great
experience musketeers have of a crowd, to which were joined an
irresistible strength of wrist, and an uncommon suppleness of
shoulders, our two travelers would not have arrived at their
place of destination.  They followed the line of the <i>Quai</i>,
which they had gained on quitting the Rue Saint-Honor&eacute;,
where they left Athos.  D'Artagnan went first; his elbow, his
wrist, his shoulder formed three wedges which he knew how to
insinuate with skill into the groups, to make them split and
separate like firewood.  He made use sometimes of the hilt of his
sword as an additional help: introducing it between ribs that
were too rebellious, making it take the part of a lever or
crowbar, to separate husband from wife, uncle from nephew, and
brother from brother.  And all that was done so naturally, and
with such gracious smiles, that people must have had ribs of
bronze not to cry thank you when the wrist made its play, or
hearts of diamond not to be enchanted when such a bland smile
enlivened the lips of the musketeer.  Raoul, following his
friend, cajoled the women who admired his beauty, pushed back the
men who felt the rigidity of his muscles, and both opened, thanks
to these maneuvers, the compact and muddy tide of the populace. 
They arrived in sight of the two gibbets, from which Raoul turned
away his eyes in disgust.  As for D'Artagnan, he did not even see
them; his house with its gabled roof, its windows crowded with
the curious, attracted and even absorbed all the attention he was
capable of.  He distinguished in the Place and around the houses
a good number of musketeers on leave, who, some with women,
others with friends, awaited the crowning ceremony.  What
rejoiced him above all was to see that his tenant, the
<i>cabaretier</i>, was so busy he hardly knew which way to turn. 
Three lads could not supply the drinkers.  They filled the shop,
the chambers, and the court, even.  D'Artagnan called Raoul's
attention to this concourse, adding: "The fellow will have no
excuse for not paying his rent.  Look at those drinkers, Raoul,
one would say they were jolly companions.  <i>Mordioux!</i> why,
there is no room anywhere!"  D'Artagnan, however, contrived to
catch hold of the master by the corner of his apron, and to make
himself known to him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, monsieur le chevalier,"
said the <i>cabaretier</i>, half distracted, "one minute if you
please.  I have here a hundred mad devils turning my cellar
upside down."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The cellar, if you like,
but not the money-box."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, monsieur, your
thirty-seven and a half pistoles are all counted out ready for
you, upstairs in my chamber; but there are in that chamber thirty
customers, who are sucking the staves of a little barrel of
Oporto which I tapped for them this very morning.  Give me a
minute, - only a minute?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So be it; so be it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I will go," said Raoul, in
a low voice, to D'Artagnan; "this hilarity is vile!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," replied
D'Artagnan, sternly, "you will please to remain where you are. 
The soldier ought to familiarize himself with all kinds of
spectacles.  There are in the eye, when it is young, fibers which
we must learn how to harden; and we are not truly generous and
good save from the moment when the eye has become hardened, and
the heart remains tender.  Besides, my little Raoul, would you
leave me alone here?  That would be very wrong of you.  Look,
there is yonder in the lower court a tree, and under the shade of
that tree we shall breathe more freely than in this hot
atmosphere of spilt wine."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                From the spot on which they
had placed themselves the two new guests of the
Image-de-Notre-Dame heard the ever-increasing hubbub of the tide
of people, and lost neither a cry nor a gesture of the drinkers,
at tables in the <i>cabaret</i>, or disseminated in the
chambers.  If D'Artagnan had wished to place himself as a
<i>vidette</i> for an expedition, he could not have succeeded
better.  The tree under which he and Raoul were seated covered
them with its already thick foliage; it was a low, thick
chestnut-tree, with inclined branches, that cast their shade over
a table so dilapidated the drinkers had abandoned it.  We said
that from this post D'Artagnan saw everything.  He observed the
goings and comings of the waiters; the arrival of fresh drinkers;
the welcome, sometimes friendly, sometimes hostile, given to the
newcomers by others already installed.  He observed all this to
amuse himself, for the thirty-seven and a half pistoles were a
long time coming.  Raoul recalled his attention to it. 
"Monsieur," said he, "you do not hurry your tenant, and the
condemned will soon be here.  There will then be such a press we
shall not be able to get out."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are right," said the
musketeer; "<i>Hol&agrave;!</i> oh! somebody there! 
<i>Mordioux!</i>"  But it was in vain he cried and knocked upon
the wreck of the old table, which fell to pieces beneath his
fist; nobody came.  D'Artagnan was preparing to go and seek the
<i>cabaretier</i> himself, to force him to a definite
explanation, when the door of the court in which he was with
Raoul, a door which communicated with the garden situated at the
back, opened, and a man dressed as a cavalier, with his sword in
the sheath, but not at his belt, crossed the court without
closing the door; and having cast an oblique glance at D'Artagnan
and his companion, directed his course towards the <i>cabaret</i>
itself, looking about in all directions with his eyes capable of
piercing walls of consciences.  "Humph!" said D'Artagnan, "my
tenants are communicating.  That, no doubt, now, is some amateur
in hanging matters."  At the same moment the cries and
disturbance in the upper chambers ceased.  Silence, under such
circumstances, surprises more than a twofold increase of noise. 
D'Artagnan wished to see what was the cause of this sudden
silence.  He then perceived that this man, dressed as a cavalier,
had just entered the principal chamber, and was haranguing the
tipplers, who all listened to him with the greatest attention. 
D'Artagnan would perhaps have heard his speech but for the
dominant noise of the popular clamors, which made a formidable
accompaniment to the harangue of the orator.  But it was soon
finished, and all the people the <i>cabaret</i> contained came
out, one after the other, in little groups, so that there only
remained six in the chamber; one of these six, the man with the
sword, took the <i>cabaretier</i> aside, engaging him in
discourse more or less serious, whilst the others lit a great
fire in the chimney-place - a circumstance rendered strange by
the fine weather and the heat.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is very singular," said
D'Artagnan to Raoul, "but I think I know those faces yonder."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Don't you think you can
smell the smoke here?" said Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I rather think I can smell
a conspiracy," replied D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                He had not finished
speaking, when four of these men came down into the court, and
without the appearance of any bad design, mounted guard at the
door of communication, casting, at intervals, glances at
D'Artagnan, which signified many things.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Mordioux!</i>" said
D'Artagnan, in a low voice," there is something going on.  Are
you curious, Raoul?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "According to the subject,
chevalier."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, I am as curious as an
old woman.  Come a little more in front; we shall get a better
view of the place.  I would lay a wager that view will be
something curious."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But you know, monsieur le
chevalier, that I am not willing to become a passive and
indifferent spectator of the death of the two poor devils."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And I, then - do you think
I am a savage?  We will go in again, when it is time to do so. 
Come along!"  And they made their way towards the front of the
house, and placed themselves near the window which, still more
strangely than the rest, remained unoccupied.  The two last
drinkers, instead of looking out at this window, kept up the
fire.  On seeing D'Artagnan and his friend enter: - "Ah! ah! a
reinforcement," murmured they.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan jogged Raoul's
elbow.  "Yes, my braves, a reinforcement," said he;
"<i>cordieu!</i> there is a famous fire.  Whom are you going to
cook?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The two men uttered a shout
of jovial laughter, and, instead of answering, threw on more
wood.  D'Artagnan could not take his eyes off them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I suppose," said one of the
fire-makers, "they sent you to tell us the time - did not
they?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Without doubt they have,"
said D'Artagnan, anxious to know what was going on; "why should I
be here else, if it were not for that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then place yourself at the
window, if you please, and observe."  D'Artagnan smiled in his
mustache, made a sign to Raoul, and placed himself at the
window.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>T</span>he spectacle
which the Gr&egrave;ve now presented was a frightful one.  The
heads, leveled by the perspective, extended afar, thick and
agitated as the ears of corn in a vast plain.  From time to time
a fresh report, or a distant rumor, made the heads oscillate and
thousands of eyes flash.  Now and then there were great
movements.  All those ears of corn bent, and became waves more
agitated than those of the ocean, which rolled from the
extremities to the center, and beat, like the tides, against the
hedge of archers who surrounded the gibbets.  Then the handles of
the halberds were let fall upon the heads and shoulders of the
rash invaders; at times, also, it was the steel as well as the
wood, and, in that case, a large empty circle was formed around
the guard; a space conquered upon the extremities, which
underwent, in their turn the oppression of the sudden movement,
which drove them against the parapets of the Seine.  From the
window, that commanded a view of the whole Place, D'Artagnan saw,
with interior satisfaction, that such of the musketeers and
guards as found themselves involved in the crowd, were able, with
blows of their fists and the hilts of theirs swords, to keep
room.  He even remarked that they had succeeded, by that
<i>esprit de corps</i> which doubles the strength of the soldier,
in getting together in one group to the amount of about fifty
men; and that, with the exception of a dozen stragglers whom he
still saw rolling here and there, the nucleus was complete, and
within reach of his voice.  But it was not the musketeers and
guards that drew the attention of D'Artagnan.  Around the
gibbets, and particularly at the entrances to the arcade of
Saint-Jean, moved a noisy mass, a busy mass; daring faces,
resolute demeanors were to be seen here and there, mingled with
silly faces and indifferent demeanors; signals were exchanged,
hands given and taken.  D'Artagnan remarked among the groups, and
those groups the most animated, the face of the cavalier whom he
had seen enter by the door of communication from his garden, and
who had gone upstairs to harangue the drinkers.  That man was
organizing troops and giving orders.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Mordioux!</i>" said
D'Artagnan to himself, "I was not deceived; I know that man, - it
is Menneville.  What the devil is he doing here?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                A distant murmur, which
became more distinct by degrees, stopped this reflection, and
drew his attention another way.  This murmur was occasioned by
the arrival of the culprits; a strong picket of archers preceded
them, and appeared at the angle of the arcade.  The entire crowd
now joined as if in one cry; all the cries united formed one
immense howl.  D'Artagnan saw Raoul was becoming pale, and he
slapped him roughly on the shoulder.  The fire-keepers turned
round on hearing the great cry, and asked what was going on. 
"The condemned are arrived," said D'Artagnan.  "That's well,"
replied they, again replenishing the fire.  D'Artagnan looked at
them with much uneasiness; it was evident that these men who were
making such a fire for no apparent purpose had some strange
intentions.  The condemned appeared upon the Place.  They were
walking, the executioner before them, whilst fifty archers formed
a hedge on their right and their left.  Both were dressed in
black; they appeared pale, but firm.  They looked impatiently
over the people's heads, standing on tip-toe at every step. 
D'Artagnan remarked this.  "<i>Mordioux!</i>" cried he, "they are
in a great hurry to get a sight of the gibbet!"  Raoul drew back,
without, however, having the power to leave the window.  Terror
even has its attractions.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To the death! to the
death!" cried fifty thousand voices.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes; to the death!" howled
a hundred frantic others, as if the great mass had given them the
reply.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To the halter! to the
halter!" cried the great whole; "<i>Vive le roi!</i>"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well," said D'Artagnan,
"this is droll; I should have thought it was M. Colbert who had
caused them to be hung."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                There was, at this moment, a
great rolling movement in the crowd, which stopped for a moment
the march of the condemned.  The people of a bold and resolute
mien, whom D'Artagnan had observed, by dint of pressing, pushing,
and lifting themselves up, had succeeded in almost touching the
hedge of archers.  The <i>cort&eacute;ge</i> resumed its march. 
All at once, to cries of "<i>Vive Colbert!</i>" those men, of
whom D'Artagnan never lost sight, fell upon the escort, which in
vain endeavored to stand against them.  Behind these men was the
crowd.  Then commenced, amidst a frightful tumult, as frightful a
confusion.  This time there was something more than cries of
expectation or cries of joy, there were cries of pain.  Halberds
struck men down, swords ran through them, muskets were discharged
at them.  The confusion became then so great that D'Artagnan
could no longer distinguish anything.  Then, from this chaos,
suddenly surged something like a visible intention, like a will
pronounced.  The condemned had been torn from the hands of the
guards, and were being dragged towards the house of
L'Image-de-Notre-Dame.  Those who dragged them shouted,
"<i>Vive</i> <i>Colbert!</i>"  The people hesitated, not knowing
which they ought to fall upon, the archers or the aggressors. 
What stopped the people was, that those who cried "<i>Vive
Colbert!</i>" began to cry, at the same time, "No halter! no
halter! to the fire! to the fire! burn the thieves! burn the
extortioners!"  This cry, shouted with an <i>ensemble</i>,
obtained enthusiastic success.  The populace had come to witness
an execution, and here was an opportunity offered them of
performing one themselves.  It was this that must be most
agreeable to the populace: therefore, they ranged themselves
immediately on the party of the aggressors against the archers,
crying with the minority, which had become, thanks to them, the
most compact majority: "Yes, yes: to the fire with the thieves! 
<i>Vive</i> <i>Colbert!</i>"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Mordioux!</i>" exclaimed
D'Artagnan, "this begins to look serious."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                One of the men who remained
near the chimney approached the window, a firebrand in his hand. 
"Ah, ah!" said he, "it gets warm."  Then, turning to his
companion: "There is the signal," added he; and he immediately
applied the burning brand to the wainscoting.  Now, this
<i>cabaret</i> of the Image-de-Notre-Dame was not a very newly
built house, and therefore, did not require much entreating to
take fire.  In a second the boards began to crackle, and the
flames arose sparkling to the ceiling.  A howling from without
replied to the shouts of the incendiaries.  D'Artagnan, who had
not seen what passed, from being engaged at the window, felt, at
the same time, the smoke which choked him and the fire that
scorched him.  "<i>Hol&agrave;!</i>" cried he, turning round, "is
the fire here?  Are you drunk or mad, my masters?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The two men looked at each
other with an air of astonishment.  "In what?" asked they of
D'Artagnan; "was it not a thing agreed upon?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A thing agreed upon that
you should burn my house!" vociferated D'Artagnan, snatching the
brand from the hand of the incendiary, and striking him with it
across the face.  The second wanted to assist his comrade, but
Raoul, seizing him by the middle, threw him out of the window,
whilst D'Artagnan pushed his man down the stairs.  Raoul, first
disengaged, tore the burning wainscoting down, and threw it
flaming into the chamber.  At a glance D'Artagnan saw there was
nothing to be feared from the fire, and sprang to the window. 
The disorder was at its height.  The air was filled with
simultaneous cries of "To the fire!"  "To the death!"  "To the
halter!"  "To the stake!"  "<i>Vive</i> <i>Colbert!</i>" 
"<i>Vive le roi!</i>"  The group which had forced the culprits
from the hands of the archers had drawn close to the house, which
appeared to be the goal towards which they dragged them. 
Menneville was at the head of this group, shouting louder than
all the others, "To the fire! to the fire!  <i>Vive</i>
<i>Colbert!</i>"  D'Artagnan began to comprehend what was meant. 
They wanted to burn the condemned, and his house was to serve as
a funeral pile.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Halt, there!" cried he,
sword in hand, and one foot upon the window.  "Menneville, what
do you want to do?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur d'Artagnan," cried
the latter; "give way, give way!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To the fire! to the fire
with the thieves!  <i>Vive Colbert!</i>"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                These cries exasperated
D'Artagnan.  "<i>Mordioux!</i>" said he.  "What! burn the poor
devils who are only condemned to be hung? that is infamous!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Before the door, however,
the mass of anxious spectators, rolled back against the walls,
had become more thick, and closed up the way.  Menneville and his
men, who were dragging along the culprits, were within ten paces
of the door.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Menneville made a last
effort.  "Passage! passage!" cried he, pistol in hand.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Burn them! burn them!"
repeated the crowd.  "The Image-de-Notre-Dame is on fire!  Burn
the thieves! burn the monopolists in the
Image-de-Notre-Dame!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                There now remained no doubt,
it was plainly D'Artagnan's house that was their object. 
D'Artagnan remembered the old cry, always so effective from his
mouth: "<i>Amoi! mousquetaires!</i>" shouted he, with the voice
of a giant, with one of those voices which dominate over cannon,
the sea, the tempest.  "<i>A</i><i>moi! mousquetaires!</i>"  And
suspending himself by the arm from the balcony, he allowed
himself to drop amidst the crowd, which began to draw back form a
house that rained men.  Raoul was on the ground as soon as he,
both sword in hand.  All the musketeers on the Place heard that
challenging cry - all turned round at that cry, and recognized
D'Artagnan.  "To the captain, to the captain!" cried they, in
their turn.  And the crowd opened before them as though before
the prow of a vessel.  At that moment D'Artagnan and Menneville
found themselves face to face.  "Passage, passage!" cried
Menneville, seeing that he was within an arm's length from the
door.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No one passes here," said
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Take that, then!" said
Menneville, firing his pistol almost within an arm's length.  But
before the cock fell, D'Artagnan had struck up Menneville's arm
with the hilt of his sword and passed the blade through his
body.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I told you plainly to keep
yourself quiet," said D'Artagnan to Menneville, who rolled at his
feet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Passage! passage!" cried
the companions of Menneville, at first terrified, but soon
recovering, when they found they had only to do with two men. 
But those two men were hundred-armed giants; the swords flew
about in their hands like the burning <i>glaive</i> of the
archangel.  They pierce with its point, strike with the flat, cut
with the edge; every stroke brings down a man.  "For the king!"
cried D'Artagnan, to every man he struck at, that is to say, to
every man that fell.  This cry became the charging word for the
musketeers, who, guided by it, joined D'Artagnan.  During this
time the archers, recovering from the panic they had undergone,
charge the aggressors in the rear, and regular as mill strokes,
overturn or knock down all that opposed them.  The crowd, which
sees swords gleaming, and drops of blood flying in the air - the
crowd falls back and crushes itself.  At length cries for mercy
and of despair resound; that is, the farewell of the vanquished. 
The two condemned are again in the hands of the archers. 
D'Artagnan approaches them, seeing them pale and sinking:
"Console yourselves, poor men," said he, "you will not undergo
the frightful torture with which these wretches threatened you. 
The king has condemned you to be hung: you shall only be hung. 
Go on, hang them, and it will be over."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                There is no longer anything
going on at the Image-de-Notre-Dame.  The fire has been
extinguished with two tuns of wine in default of water.  The
conspirators have fled by the garden.  The archers are dragging
the culprits to the gibbets.  From this moment the affair did not
occupy much time.  The executioner, heedless about operating
according to the rules of the art, made such haste that he
dispatched the condemned in a couple of minutes.  In the meantime
the people gathered around D'Artagnan, - they felicitated, they
cheered him.  He wiped his brow, streaming with sweat, and his
sword, streaming with blood.  He shrugged his shoulders at seeing
Menneville writhing at his feet in the last convulsions.  And,
while Raoul turned away his eyes in compassion, he pointed to the
musketeers the gibbets laden with their melancholy fruit.  "Poor
devils!" said he, "I hope they died blessing me, for I saved them
with great difficulty."  These words caught the ear of Menneville
at the moment when he himself was breathing his last sigh.  A
dark, ironical smile flitted across his lips; he wished to reply,
but the effort hastened the snapping of the chord of life - he
expired.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! all this is very
frightful!" murmured Raoul: "let us begone, monsieur le
chevalier."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are not wounded?" asked
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Not at all; thank you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That's well!  Thou art a
brave fellow, <i>mordioux!</i>  The head of the father, and the
arm of Porthos.  Ah! if he had been here, good Porthos, you would
have seen something worth looking at."  Then as if by way of
remembrance -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But where the devil can
that brave Porthos be?" murmured D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Come, chevalier, pray come
away," urged Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "One minute, my friend; let
me take my thirty-seven and a half pistols, and I am at your
service.  The house is a good property," added D'Artagnan, as he
entered the Image-de-Notre-Dame, "but decidedly, even if it were
less profitable, I should prefer its being in another
quarter."</p>

violent, noisy, and bloody scene was passing on the Gr&egrave;ve,
several men, barricaded behind the gate of communication with the
garden, replaced their swords in their sheaths, assisted one
among them to mount a ready saddled horse which was waiting in
the garden, and like a flock of startled birds, fled in all
directions, some climbing the walls, others rushing out at the
gates with all the fury of a panic.  He who mounted the horse,
and gave him the spur so sharply that the animal was near leaping
the wall, this cavalier, we say, crossed the Place Baudoyer,
passed like lightening before the crowd in the streets, riding
against, running over and knocking down all that came in his way,
and, ten minutes after, arrived at the gates of the
superintendent, more out of breath than his horse.  The
Abb&eacute; Fouquet, at the clatter of hoofs on the pavement,
appeared at a window of the court, and before even the cavalier
had set foot to the ground, "Well!  Danicamp?" cried he, leaning
half out of the window.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, it is all over,"
replied the cavalier.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "All over!" cried the

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, monsieur," replied the

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Hung!" repeated the
abb&eacute;, turning pale.  A lateral door suddenly opened, and
Fouquet appeared in the chamber, pale, distracted, with lips half
opened, breathing a cry of grief and anger.  He stopped upon the
threshold to listen to what was addressed from the court to the
window.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Miserable wretches!" said

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A hundred men accustomed to
war, sword in hand, are worth ten thousand archers in a
surprise.  Where is Menneville, that boaster, that braggart, who
was to come back either dead or a conqueror?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, monsieur, he kept his
word.  He is dead!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Dead!  Who killed him?"</p>

a giant armed with ten flaming swords - a madman, who at one blow
extinguished the fire, put down the riot, and caused a hundred
musketeers to rise up out of the pavement of the

<p class="MsoNormal">                Fouquet raised his brow,
streaming with sweat, murmuring, "Oh!  Lyodot and D'Eymeris!
dead! dead! dead! and I dishonored."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The abb&eacute; turned
round, and perceiving his brother, despairing and livid, "Come,

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Be silent, abb&eacute;! be

event."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But, brother - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Obey, monsieur!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The abb&eacute; made a sign,
and in half a minute the man's step was heard upon the stairs. 
At the same time Gourville appeared behind Fouquet, like the
guardian angel of the superintendent, pressing one finger on his
lips to enjoin observation even amidst the bursts of his grief. 
The minister resumed all the serenity that human strength left at
the disposal of a heart half broken with sorrow.  Danicamp
appeared.  "Make your report," said Gourville.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," replied the
messenger, "we received orders to carry off the prisoners, and to
cry '<i>Vive Colbert!</i>' whilst carrying them off."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To burn them alive, was it
not, abb&eacute;?" interrupted Gourville.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, yes, the order was
given to Menneville.  Menneville knew what was to be done, and
Menneville is dead."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This news appeared rather to
reassure Gourville than to sadden him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, certainly to burn them
alive," said the abb&eacute;, eagerly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Granted, monsieur,
granted," said the man, looking into the eyes and the faces of
the two interlocutors, to ascertain what there was profitable or
disadvantageous to himself in telling the truth.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Now, proceed," said
Gourville.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The prisoners," cried
Danicamp, "were brought to the Gr&egrave;ve, and the people, in a
fury, insisted upon their being burnt instead of being hung."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And the people were right,"
said the abb&eacute;.  "Go on."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But," resumed the man, "at
the moment the archers were broken, at the moment the fire was
set to one of the houses of the Place destined to serve as a
funeral-pile for the guilty, this fury, this demon, this giant of
whom I told you, and who, we had been informed, was the
proprietor of the house in question, aided by a young man who
accompanied him, threw out of the window those who kept the fire,
called to his assistance the musketeers who were in the crowd,
leaped himself from the window of the first story into the Place,
and plied his sword so desperately that the victory was restored
to the archers, the prisoners were retaken, and Menneville
killed.  When once recaptured, the condemned were executed in
three minutes."  Fouquet, in spite of his self-command, could not
prevent a deep groan escaping him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And this man, the
proprietor of the house, what is his name?" said the
abb&eacute;.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I cannot tell you, not
having even been able to get sight of him; my post had been
appointed in the garden, and I remained at my post: only the
affair was related to me as I repeat it.  I was ordered, when
once the affair was at an end, to come at best speed and announce
to you the manner in which it finished.  According to this order,
I set out, full gallop, and here I am."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very well, monsieur, we
have nothing else to ask of you," said the abb&eacute;, more and
more dejected, in proportion as the moment approached for finding
himself alone with his brother.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Have you been paid?" asked
Gourville.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Partly, monsieur," replied
Danicamp.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Here are twenty pistols. 
Begone, monsieur, and never forget to defend, as this time has
been done, the true interests of the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur," said the
man, bowing and pocketing the money.  After which he went out. 
Scarcely had the door closed after him when Fouquet, who had
remained motionless, advanced with a rapid step and stood between
the abb&eacute; and Gourville.  Both of them at the same time
opened their mouths to speak to him.  "No excuses," said he, "no
recriminations against anybody.  If I had not been a false friend
I should not have confided to any one the care of delivering
Lyodot and D'Eymeris.  I alone am guilty; to me alone are
reproaches and remorse due.  Leave me, abb&eacute;."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And yet, monsieur, you will
not prevent me," replied the latter, "from endeavoring to find
out the miserable fellow who has intervened to the advantage of
M. Colbert in this so well-arranged affair; for, if it is good
policy to love our friends dearly, I do not believe that is bad
which consists in obstinately pursuing our enemies."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A truce to policy,
abb&eacute;; begone, I beg of you, and do not let me hear any
more of you till I send for you; what we most need is
circumspection and silence.  You have a terrible example before
you, gentlemen: no reprisals, I forbid them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "There are no orders,"
grumbled the abb&eacute;, "which will prevent me from avenging a
family affront upon the guilty person."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And I," cried Fouquet, in
that imperative tone to which one feels there is nothing to
reply, "if you entertain one thought, one single thought, which
is not the absolute expression of my will, I will have you cast
into the Bastile two hours after that thought has manifested
itself.  Regulate your conduct accordingly, abb&eacute;."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The abb&eacute; colored and
bowed.  Fouquet made a sign to Gourville to follow him, and was
already directing his steps towards his cabinet, when the usher
announced with a loud voice: "Monsieur le Chevalier
d'Artagnan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who is he?" said Fouquet,
negligently, to Gourville.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "An ex-lieutenant of his
majesty's musketeers," replied Gourville, in the same tone. 
Fouquet did not even take the trouble to reflect, and resumed his
walk.  "I beg your pardon, monseigneur!" said Gourville, "but I
have remembered; this brave man has quitted the king's service,
and probably comes to receive an installment of some pension or
other."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Devil take him!" said
Fouquet, "why does he choose his opportunity so ill?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Permit me then,
monseigneur, to announce your refusal to him; for he is one of my
acquaintance, and is a man whom, in our present circumstances, it
would be better to have as a friend than an enemy."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Answer him as you please,"
said Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eh! good Lord!" said the
abb&eacute;, still full of malice, like an egotistical man; "tell
him there is no money, particularly for musketeers."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                But scarcely had the
abb&eacute; uttered this imprudent speech, when the partly open
door was thrown back, and D'Artagnan appeared.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eh!  Monsieur Fouquet,"
said he, "I was well aware there was no money for musketeers
here.  Therefore I did not come to obtain any, but to have it
refused.  That being done, receive my thanks.  I give you
good-day, and will go and seek it at M. Colbert's."  And he went
out, making an easy bow.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Gourville," said Fouquet,
"run after that man and bring him back."  Gourville obeyed, and
overtook D'Artagnan on the stairs.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan, hearing steps
behind him, turned round and perceived Gourville. 
"<i>Mordioux!</i> my dear monsieur," said he, "there are sad
lessons which you gentlemen of finance teach us; I come to M.
Fouquet to receive a sum accorded by his majesty, and I am
received like a mendicant who comes to ask charity, or a thief
who comes to steal a piece of plate."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But you pronounced the name
of M. Colbert, my dear M. d'Artagnan; you said you were going to
M. Colbert's?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I certainly am going there,
were it only to ask satisfaction of the people who try to burn
houses, crying '<i>Vive Colbert!</i>'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Gourville pricked up his
ears.  "Oh, oh!" said he, "you allude to what has just happened
at the Gr&egrave;ve?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, certainly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And in what did that which
has taken place concern you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What! do you ask me whether
it concerns me or does not concern me, if M. Colbert pleases to
make a funeral-pile of my house?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So, ho, <i>your</i> house -
was it <i>your</i> house they wanted to burn?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Pardieu!</i> was
it!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is the <i>cabaret</i> of
the Image-de-Notre-Dame yours, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It has been this week."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, then, are you the
brave captain, are you the valiant blade who dispersed those who
wished to burn the condemned?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My dear Monsieur Gourville,
put yourself in my place.  I was an agent of the public force and
a landlord, too.  As a captain, it is my duty to have the orders
of the king accomplished.  As a proprietor, it is to my interest
my house should not be burnt.  I have at the same time attended
to the laws of interest and duty in replacing Messieurs Lyodot
and D'Eymeris in the hands of the archers."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then it was you who threw
the man out of the window?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It was I, myself," replied
D'Artagnan, modestly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you who killed
Menneville?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I had that misfortune,"
said D'Artagnan, bowing like a man who is being
congratulated.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It was you, then, in short,
who caused the two condemned persons to be hung?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Instead of being burnt,
yes, monsieur, and I am proud of it.  I saved the poor devils
from horrible tortures.  Understand, my dear Monsieur de
Gourville, that they wanted to burn them alive.  It exceeds
imagination!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Go, my dear Monsieur
d'Artagnan, go," said Gourville, anxious to spare Fouquet the
sight of the man who had just caused him such profound grief.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No," said Fouquet, who had
heard all from the door of the ante-chamber; "not so; on the
contrary, Monsieur d'Artagnan, come in."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan wiped from the
hilt of his sword a last bloody trace, which had escaped his
notice, and returned.  He then found himself face to face with
these three men, whose countenances wore very different
expressions.  With the abb&eacute; it was anger, with Gourville
stupor, with Fouquet it was dejection.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I beg your pardon, monsieur
le ministre," said D'Artagnan, "but my time is short; I have to
go to the office of the intendant, to have an explanation with
Monsieur Colbert, and to receive my quarter's pension."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But, monsieur," said
Fouquet, "there is money here."  D'Artagnan looked at the
superintendent with astonishment.  "You have been answered
inconsiderately, monsieur, I know, because I heard it," said the
minister; "a man of your merit ought to be known by everybody." 
D'Artagnan bowed.  "Have you an order?" added Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Give it me, I will pay you
myself; come with me."  He made a sign to Gourville and the
abb&eacute;, who remained in the chamber where they were.  He led
D'Artagnan into his cabinet.  As soon as the door was shut, -
"how much is due to you, monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, something like five
thousand livres, monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "For arrears of pay?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "For a quarter's pay."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A quarter consisting of
five thousand livres!" said Fouquet, fixing upon the musketeer a
searching look.  "Does the king, then, give you twenty thousand
livres a year?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monseigneur, twenty
thousand livres a year.  Do you think it is too much?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I?" cried Fouquet, and he
smiled bitterly.  "If I had any knowledge of mankind, if I were -
instead of being a frivolous, inconsequent, and vain spirit - of
a prudent and reflective spirit; if, in a word, I had, as certain
persons have known how, regulated my life, you would not receive
twenty thousand livres a year, but a hundred thousand, and you
would belong not to the king but to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan colored
slightly.  There is sometimes in the manner in which a eulogium
is given, in the voice, in the affectionate tone, a poison so
sweet, that the strongest mind is intoxicated by it.  The
superintendent terminated his speech by opening a drawer, and
taking from it four <i>rouleaux</i>, which he placed before
D'Artagnan.  The Gascon opened one.  "Gold!" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It will be less burdensome,
monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But, then, monsieur, these
make twenty thousand livres."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No doubt they do."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But only five are due to
me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I wish to spare you the
trouble of coming four times to my office."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You overwhelm me,
monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I do only what I ought to
do, monsieur le chevalier; and I hope you will not bear me any
malice on account of the rude reception my brother gave you.  He
is of a sour, capricious disposition."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," said D'Artagnan,
"believe me, nothing would grieve me more than an excuse from
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Therefore I will make no
more, and will content myself with asking you a favor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Fouquet drew from his finger
a ring worth about three thousand pistoles.  "Monsieur," said he,
"this stone was given me by a friend of my childhood, by a man to
whom you have rendered a great service."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A service - I?" said the
musketeer; "I have rendered a service to one of your
friends?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You cannot have forgotten
it, monsieur, for it dates this very day."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And that friend's name was
- "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "M. d'Eymeris."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "One of the condemned?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, one of the victims. 
Well!  Monsieur d'Artagnan, in return for the service you have
rendered him, I beg you to accept this diamond.  Do so for my
sake."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur! you - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Accept it, I say.  To-day
is with me a day of mourning; hereafter you will, perhaps, learn
why; to-day I have lost one friend; well, I will try to get
another."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But, Monsieur Fouquet -
"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Adieu!  Monsieur
d'Artagnan, adieu!"  cried Fouquet, with much emotion; "or
rather, <i>au revoir</i>."  And the minister quitted the cabinet,
leaving in the hands of the musketeer the ring and the twenty
thousand livres.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!" said D'Artagnan, after
a moment's dark reflection.  "How on earth am I to understand
what this means?  <i>Mordioux!</i>  I can understand this much,
only: he is a gallant man!  I will go and explain matters to M.
Colbert."  And he went out.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>M</span>. Colbert
resided in the Rue Neuve des Petits-Champs, in a house which had
belonged to Beautru.  D'Artagnan's legs cleared the distance in a
short quarter of an hour.  When he arrived at the residence of
the new favorite, the court was full of archers and police, who
came to congratulate him, or to excuse themselves, according to
whether he should choose to praise or blame.  The sentiment of
flattery is instinctive with people of abject condition; they
have the sense of it, as the wild animal has that of hearing and
smell.  These people, or their leader, understood that there was
a pleasure to offer to M. Colbert, in rendering him an account of
the fashion in which his name had been pronounced during the rash
enterprise of the morning.  D'Artagnan made his appearance just
as the chief of the watch was giving his report.  He stood close
to the door, behind the archers.  That officer took Colbert on
one side, in spite of his resistance and the contradiction of his
bushy eyebrows.  "In case," said he, "you really desired,
monsieur, that the people should do justice on the two traitors,
it would have been wise to warn us of it; for, indeed, monsieur,
in spite of our regret at displeasing you, or thwarting your
views, we had our orders to execute."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Triple fool!" replied
Colbert, furiously shaking his hair, thick and black as a mane;
"what are you telling me?  What! that <i>I</i> could have had an
idea of a riot!  Are you mad or drunk?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But, monsieur, they cried
'<i>Vive Colbert!</i>'" replied the trembling watch.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A handful of conspirators -
"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, no; a mass of
people."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! indeed," said Colbert,
expanding.  "A mass of people cried '<i>Vive</i>
<i>Colbert!</i>'  Are you certain of what you say, monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "We had nothing to do but
open our ears, or rather to close them, so terrible were the
cries."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And this was from the
people, the real people?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Certainly, monsieur; only
these real people beat us."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! very well," continued
Colbert, thoughtfully.  "Then you suppose it was the people alone
who wished to burn the condemned?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! yes, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is quite another
thing.  You strongly resisted, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "We had three of our men
crushed to death, monsieur!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But you killed nobody
yourselves?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, a few of the
rioters were left upon the square, and one among them who was not
a common man."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who was he?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A certain Menneville, upon
whom the police have a long time had an eye."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Menneville!" cried Colbert,
"what, he who killed Rue de la Huchette, a worthy man who wanted
a fat fowl?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur; the
same."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And did this Menneville
also cry, '<i>Vive</i> <i>Colbert</i>'?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Louder than all the rest;
like a madman."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Colbert's brow grew dark and
wrinkled.  A kind of ambitious glory which had lighted his face
was extinguished, like the light of glow-worms we crush beneath
the grass.  "Then you say," resumed the deceived intendant, "that
the initiative came from the people?  Menneville was my enemy; I
would have had him hung, and he knew it well.  Menneville
belonged to the Abb&eacute; Fouquet - the affair originated with
Fouquet; does not everybody know that the condemned were his
friends from childhood?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is true," thought
D'Artagnan, "and thus are all my doubts cleared up.  I repeat it,
Monsieur Fouquet may be called what they please, but he is a very
gentlemanly man."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And," continued Colbert,
"are you quite sure Menneville is dead?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan thought the time
was come for him to make his appearance.  "Perfectly, monsieur;"
replied he, advancing suddenly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! is that you, monsieur?"
said Colbert.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In person," replied the
musketeer with his deliberate tone; "it appears that you had in
Menneville a pretty enemy."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It was not I, monsieur, who
had an enemy," replied Colbert; "it was the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Double brute!" thought
D'Artagnan, "to think to play the great man and the hypocrite
with me.  Well," continued he to Colbert, "I am very happy to
have rendered so good a service to the king; will you take upon
you to tell his majesty, monsieur l'intendant?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What commission is this you
give me, and what do you charge me to tell his majesty,
monsieur?  Be precise, if you please," said Colbert, in a sharp
voice, tuned beforehand to hostility.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I give you no commission,"
replied D'Artagnan, with that calmness which never abandons the
banterer; "I thought it would be easy for you to announce to his
majesty that it was I who, being there by chance, did justice
upon Menneville and restored order to things."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Colbert opened his eyes and
interrogated the chief of the watch with a look - "Ah! it is very
true," said the latter, "that this gentleman saved us."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why did you not tell me,
monsieur, that you came to relate me this?" said Colbert with
envy; "everything is explained, and more favorably for you than
for anybody else."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are in error, monsieur
l'intendant, I did not at all come for the purpose of relating
that to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is an exploit,
nevertheless."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!" said the musketeer
carelessly, "constant habit blunts the mind."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To what do I owe the honor
of your visit, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Simply to this: the king
ordered me to come to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah!" said Colbert,
recovering himself when he saw D'Artagnan draw a paper from his
pocket; "it is to demand some money of me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Precisely, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Have the goodness to wait,
if you please, monsieur, till I have dispatched the report of the
watch."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan turned upon his
heel, insolently enough, and finding himself face to face with
Colbert, after his first turn, he bowed to him as a harlequin
would have done; then, after a second evolution, he directed his
steps towards the door in quick time.  Colbert was struck with
this pointed rudeness, to which he was not accustomed.  In
general, men of the sword, when they came to his office, had such
a want of money, that though their feet seemed to take root in
the marble, they hardly lost their patience.  Was D'Artagnan
going straight to the king?  Would he go and describe his rough
reception, or recount his exploit?  This was a matter for grave
consideration.  At all events, the moment was badly chosen to
send D'Artagnan away, whether he came from the king, or on his
own account.  The musketeer had rendered too great a service, and
that too recently, for it to be already forgotten.  Therefore
Colbert thought it would be better to shake off his arrogance and
call D'Artagnan back.  "Ho!  Monsieur d'Artagnan," cried Colbert,
"what! are you leaving me thus?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan turned round:
"Why not?" said he, quietly, "we have no more to say to each
other, have we?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You have, at least, money
to receive, as you have an order?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who, I?  Oh! not at all, my
dear Monsieur Colbert."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But, monsieur, you have an
order.  And, in the same manner as you give a sword-thrust, when
you are required, I, on my part, pay when an order is presented
to me.  Present yours."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is useless, my dear
Monsieur Colbert," said D'Artagnan, who inwardly enjoyed this
confusion in the ideas of Colbert; "my order is paid."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Paid, by whom?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "By monsieur le
surintendant."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Colbert grew pale.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Explain yourself," said he,
in a stifled voice - "if you are paid why do you show me that
paper?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In consequence of the word
of order of which you spoke to me so ingeniously just now, dear
M. Colbert; the king told me to take a quarter of the pension he
is pleased to make me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Of me?" said Colbert.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Not exactly.  The king said
to me: 'Go to M. Fouquet; the superintendent will, perhaps, have
no money, then you will go and draw it of M. Colbert.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The countenance of M.
Colbert brightened for a moment; but it was with his unfortunate
physiognomy as with a stormy sky, sometimes radiant, sometimes
dark as night, according as the lightening gleams or the cloud
passes.  "Eh! and was there any money in the superintendent's
coffers?" asked he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, yes, he could not be
badly off for money," replied D'Artagnan - "it may be believed,
since M. Fouquet, instead of paying me a quarter or five thousand
livres - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A quarter or five thousand
livres!" cried Colbert, struck, as Fouquet had been, with the
generosity of the sum for a soldier's pension, "why, that would
be a pension of twenty thousand livres?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Exactly, M. Colbert. 
<i>Peste!</i> you reckon like old Pythagoras; yes, twenty
thousand livres."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ten times the appointment
of an intendant of the finances.  I beg to offer you my
compliments," said Colbert, with a vicious smile.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!" said D'Artagnan, "the
king apologized for giving me so little; but he promised to make
it more hereafter, when he should be rich; but I must be gone,
having much to do - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So, then, notwithstanding
the expectation of the king, the superintendent paid you, did
he?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In the same manner, as, in
opposition to the king's expectation, you refused to pay me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I did not refuse, monsieur,
I only begged you to wait.  And you say that M. Fouquet paid you
your five thousand livres?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, as <i>you</i> might
have done; but he did even better than that, M. Colbert."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And what did he do?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He politely counted me down
the sum-total, saying, that for the king, his coffers were always
full."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The sum-total!  M. Fouquet
has given you twenty thousand livres instead of five
thousand?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And what for?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In order to spare me three
visits to the money-chest of the superintendent, so that I have
the twenty thousand livres in my pocket in good new coin.  You
see, then, that I am able to go away without standing in need of
you, having come here only for form's sake."  And D'Artagnan
slapped his hand upon his pocket, with a laugh which disclosed to
Colbert thirty-two magnificent teeth, as white as teeth of
twenty-five years old, and which seemed to say in their language:
"Serve up to us thirty-two little Colberts, and we will chew them
willingly."  The serpent is as brave as the lion, the hawk as
courageous as the eagle, that cannot be contested.  It can only
be said of animals that are decidedly cowardly, and are so
called, that they will be brave only when they have to defend
themselves.  Colbert was not frightened at the thirty-two teeth
of D'Artagnan.  He recovered, and suddenly, - "Monsieur," said
he, "monsieur le surintendant has done what he had no right to
do."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What do you mean by that?"
replied D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I mean that your note -
will you let me see your note, if you please?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very willingly; here it
is."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Colbert seized the paper
with an eagerness which the musketeer did not remark without
uneasiness, and particularly without a certain degree of regret
at having trusted him with it.  "Well, monsieur, the royal order
says thus: - 'At sight, I command that there be paid to M.
d'Artagnan the sum of five thousand livres, forming a quarter of
the pension I have made him.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So, in fact, it is
written," said D'Artagnan, affecting calmness.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very well; the king only
owed you five thousand livres; why has more been given to
you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Because there was more; and
M. Fouquet was willing to give me more; that does not concern
anybody."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is natural," said
Colbert with a proud ease, "that you should be ignorant of the
usages of state-finance; but, monsieur, when you have a thousand
livres to pay, what do you do?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I never have a thousand
livres to pay," replied D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Once more," said Colbert,
irritated - "once more, if you had any sum to pay, would you not
pay what you ought?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That only proves one
thing," said D'Artagnan; "and that is, that you have your own
particular customs in finance, and M. Fouquet has his own."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Mine, monsieur, are the
correct ones."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I do not say that they are
not."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you have accepted what
was not due to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan's eyes flashed. 
"What is not due to me <i>yet</i>, you meant to say, M. Colbert;
for if I have received what was not due to me at all, I should
have committed a theft."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Colbert made no reply to
this subtlety.  "You then owe fifteen thousand livres to the
public chest," said he, carried away by his jealous ardor.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then you must give me
credit for them," replied D'Artagnan, with his imperceptible
irony.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Not at all, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well! what will you do,
then?  You will not take my <i>rouleaux</i> from me, will
you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You must return them to my
chest."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I!  Oh!  Monsieur Colbert,
don't reckon upon that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The king wants his money,
monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And I, monsieur, I want the
king's money."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That may be so; but you
must return this."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Not a <i>sou</i>.  I have
always understood that in matters of <i>comptabilit&eacute;</i>,
as you call it, a good cashier never gives back or takes
back."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then, monsieur, we shall
see what the king will say about it.  I will show him this note,
which proves that M. Fouquet not only pays what he does not owe,
but that he does not even take care of vouchers for the sums that
he has paid."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! now I understand why
you have taken that paper, M. Colbert!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Colbert did not perceive all
that there was of a threatening character in his name pronounced
in a certain manner.  "You shall see hereafter what use I will
make of it," said he, holding up the paper in his fingers.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!" said D'Artagnan,
snatching the paper from him with a rapid movement; "I understand
perfectly well, M. Colbert; I have no occasion to wait for
that."  And he crumpled up the paper he had so cleverly
seized.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, monsieur!" cried
Colbert, "this is violence!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Nonsense!  You must not be
particular about a soldier's manners!" replied D'Artagnan.  "I
kiss your hands, my dear M. Colbert."  And he went out, laughing
in the face of the future minister.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That man, now," muttered
he, "was about to grow quite friendly; it is a great pity I was
obliged to cut his company so soon."</p>

'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>F</span>or a man who
had seen so many much more dangerous ones, the position of
D'Artagnan with respect to M. Colbert was only comic. 
D'Artagnan, therefore, did not deny himself the satisfaction of
laughing at the expense of monsieur l'intendant, from the Rue des
Petits-Champs to the Rue des Lombards.  It was a great while
since D'Artagnan had laughed so long together.  He was still
laughing when Planchet appeared, laughing likewise, at the door
of his house; for Planchet, since the return of his patron, since
the entrance of the English guineas, passed the greater part of
his life in doing what D'Artagnan had only done from the Rue
Neuve des Petits-Champs to the Rue des Lombards.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are home, then, my dear
master?" said Planchet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, my friend," replied the
musketeer; "I am off, and that quickly.  I will sup with you, go
to bed, sleep five hours, and at break of day leap into my
saddle.  Has my horse had an extra feed?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eh! my dear master,"
replied Planchet, "you know very well that your horse is the
jewel of the family; that my lads are caressing it all day, and
cramming it with sugar, nuts, and biscuits.  You ask me if he has
had an extra feed of oats; you should ask if he has not had
enough to burst him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very well, Planchet, that
is all right.  Now, then, I pass to what concerns me - my
supper?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ready.  A smoking roast
joint, white wine, crayfish, and fresh-gathered cherries.  All
ready, my master."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are a capital fellow,
Planchet; come on, then, let us sup, and I will go to bed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                During supper D'Artagnan
observed that Planchet kept rubbing his forehead, as if to
facilitate the issue of some idea closely pent within his brain. 
He looked with an air of kindness at this worthy companion of
former adventures and misadventures, and, clinking glass against
glass, "Come, Planchet," said he, "let us see what it is that
gives you so much trouble to bring forth.  <i>Mordioux!</i> 
Speak freely, and quickly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, this is it," replied
Planchet: "you appear to me to be going on some expedition or
another."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I don't say that I am
not."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then you have some new
idea?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is possible, too,
Planchet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then there will be fresh
capital to be ventured?  I will lay down fifty thousand livres
upon the idea you are about to carry out."  And so saying,
Planchet rubbed his hands one against the other with a rapidity
evincing great delight.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Planchet," said D'Artagnan,
"there is but one misfortune in it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And what is that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That the idea is not mine. 
I can risk nothing upon it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                These words drew a deep sigh
from the heart of Planchet.  That Avarice is an ardent counselor;
she carries away her man, as Satan did Jesus, to the mountain,
and when once she has shown to an unfortunate all the kingdoms of
the earth, she is able to repose herself, knowing full well that
she has left her companion, Envy, to gnaw at his heart.  Planchet
had tasted of riches easily acquired, and was never afterwards
likely to stop in his desires; but, as he had a good heart in
spite of his covetousness, as he adored D'Artagnan, he could not
refrain from making him a thousand recommendations, each more
affectionate than the others.  He would not have been sorry,
nevertheless, to have caught a little hint of the secret his
master concealed so well; tricks, turns, counsels, and traps were
all useless, D'Artagnan let nothing confidential escape him.  The
evening passed thus.  After supper the portmanteau occupied
D'Artagnan, he took a turn to the stable, patted his horse, and
examined his shoes and legs; then, having counted over his money,
he went to bed, sleeping as if only twenty, because he had
neither inquietude nor remorse; he closed his eyes five minutes
after he had blown out his lamp.  Many events might, however,
have kept him awake.  Thought boiled in his brain, conjectures
abounded, and D'Artagnan was a great drawer of horoscopes; but,
with that imperturbable phlegm which does more than genius for
the fortune and happiness of men of action, he put off reflection
till the next day, for fear, he said, not to be fresh when he
wanted to be so.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The day came.  The Rue des
Lombards had its share of the caresses of Aurora with the rosy
fingers, and D'Artagnan arose like Aurora.  He did not awaken
anybody, he placed his portmanteau under his arm, descended the
stairs without making one of them creak, and without disturbing
one of the sonorous snorings in every story from the garret to
the cellar, then, having saddled his horse, shut the stable and
house doors, he set off, at a foot-pace, on his expedition to
Bretagne.  He had done quite right not to trouble himself with
all the political and diplomatic affairs which solicited his
attention; for, in the morning, in freshness and mild twilight,
his ideas developed themselves in purity and abundance.  In the
first place, he passed before the house of Fouquet, and threw in
a large gaping box the fortunate order which, the evening before,
he had had so much trouble to recover from the hooked fingers of
the intendant.  Placed in an envelope, and addressed to Fouquet,
it had not even been divined by Planchet, who in divination was
equal to Calchas or the Pythian Apollo.  D'Artagnan thus sent
back the order to Fouquet, without compromising himself, and
without having thenceforward any reproaches to make himself. 
When he had effected this proper restitution, "Now," he said to
himself, "let us inhale much maternal air, much freedom from
cares, much health, let us allow the horse Zephyr, whose flanks
puff as if he had to respire an atmosphere, to breathe, and let
us be very ingenious in our little calculations.  It is time,"
said D'Artagnan, "to form a plan of the campaign, and, according
to the method of M. Turenne, who has a large head full of all
sorts of good counsels, before the plan of the campaign it is
advisable to draw a striking portrait of the generals to whom we
are opposed.  In the first place, M. Fouquet presents himself. 
What is M. Fouquet?  M. Fouquet," replied D'Artagnan to himself,
"is a handsome man, very much beloved by the women, a generous
man very much beloved by the poets; a man of wit, much execrated
by pretenders.  Well, now I am neither woman, poet, nor
pretender: I neither love not hate monsieur le surintendant.  I
find myself, therefore, in the same position in which M. Turenne
found himself when opposed to the Prince de Cond&eacute; at
Jargeau, Gien and the Faubourg Saint-Antoine.  He did not
execrate monsieur le prince, it is true, but he obeyed the king. 
Monsieur le prince is an agreeable man, but the king is king. 
Turenne heaved a deep sigh, called Cond&eacute; 'My cousin,' and
swept away his army.  Now what does the king wish?  That does not
concern me.  Now, what does M. Colbert wish?  Oh, that's another
thing.  M. Colbert wishes all that M. Fouquet does not wish. 
Then what does M. Fouquet wish?  Oh, that is serious.  M. Fouquet
wishes precisely for all the king wishes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This monologue ended,
D'Artagnan began to laugh, whilst making his whip whistle in the
air.  He was already on the high road, frightening the birds in
the hedges, listening to the livres chinking and dancing in his
leather pocket, at every step; and, let us confess it, every time
that D'Artagnan found himself in such conditions, tenderness was
not his dominant vice.  "Come," said he, "I cannot think the
expedition a very dangerous one; and it will fall out with my
voyage as with that piece M. Monk took me to see in London, which
was called, I think, 'Much Ado about Nothing.'"</p>

'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>I</span>t was perhaps
the fiftieth time since the day on which we open this history,
that this man, with a heart of bronze and muscles of steel, had
left house and friends, everything, in short, to go in search of
fortune and death.  The one - that is to say, death - had
constantly retreated before him, as if afraid of him; the other -
that is to say, fortune - for only a month past had really made
an alliance with him.  Although he was not a great philosopher,
after the fashion of either Epicurus or Socrates, he was a
powerful spirit, having knowledge of life, and endowed with
thought.  No one is as brave, as adventurous, or as skillful as
D'Artagnan, without at the same time being inclined to be a
<i>dreamer</i>.  He had picked up, here and there, some scraps of
M. de la Rochefoucault, worthy of being translated into Latin by
MM. de Port Royal; and he had made a collection, <i>en
passant</i>, in the society of Athos and Aramis, of many morsels
of Seneca and Cicero, translated by them, and applied to the uses
of common life.  That contempt of riches which our Gascon had
observed as an article of faith during the thirty-five first
years of his life, had for a long time been considered by him as
the first article of the code of bravery.  "Article first," said
he, "A man is brave because he has nothing.  A man has nothing
because he despises riches."  Therefore, with these principles,
which, as we have said, had regulated the thirty-five first years
of his life, D'Artagnan was no sooner possessed of riches, than
he felt it necessary to ask himself if, in spite of his riches,
he were still brave.  To this, for any other but D'Artagnan, the
events of the Place de Gr&egrave;ve might have served as a
reply.  Many consciences would have been satisfied with them, but
D'Artagnan was brave enough to ask himself sincerely and
conscientiously if he were brave.  Therefore to this: -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But it appears to me that I
drew promptly enough, and cut and thrust pretty freely on the
Place de Gr&egrave;ve, to be satisfied of my bravery," D'Artagnan
had himself replied.  "Gently, captain, that is not an answer.  I
was brave that day, because they were burning my house, and there
are a hundred, and even a thousand, to speak against one, that if
those gentlemen of the riots had not formed that unlucky idea,
their plan of attack would have succeeded, or, at least, it would
not have been I who would have opposed myself to it.  Now, what
will be brought against me?  I have no house to be burnt in
Bretagne; I have no treasure there that can be taken from me. -
No; but I have my skin; that precious skin of M. d'Artagnan,
which to him is worth more than all the houses and all the
treasures of the world.  That skin to which I cling above
everything, because it is, everything considered, the binding of
a body which encloses a heart very warm and ready to fight, and,
consequently, to live.  Then, I do desire to live: and, in
reality, I live much better, more completely, since I have become
rich.  Who the devil ever said that money spoiled life?  Upon my
soul, it is no such thing, on the contrary, it seems as if I
absorbed a double quantity of air and sun.  <i>Mordioux!</i> what
will it be then, if I double that fortune; and if, instead of the
switch I now hold in my hand, I should ever carry the b&acirc;ton
of a mar&eacute;chal?  Then I really don't know if there will be,
from that moment, enough of air and sun for me.  In fact, this is
not a dream, who the devil would oppose it, if the king made me a
mar&eacute;chal, as his father, King Louis XIII., made a duke and
constable of Albert de Luynes?  Am I not as brave, and much more
intelligent, than that imbecile De Vitry?  Ah! that's exactly
what will prevent my advancement: I have too much wit.  Luckily,
if there is any justice in this world, fortune owes me many
compensations.  She owes me certainly a recompense for all I did
for Anne of Austria, and an indemnification for all she has not
done for me.  Then, at the present, I am very well with a king,
and with a king who has the appearance of determining to reign. 
May God keep him in that illustrious road!  For, if he is
resolved to reign, he will want me; and if he wants me, he will
give me what he has promised me - warmth and light; so that I
march, comparatively, now, as I marched formerly, - from nothing
to everything.  Only the nothing of to-day is the all of former
days; there has only this little change taken place in my life. 
And now let us see! let us take the part of the heart, as I just
now was speaking of it.  But in truth, I only spoke of it from
memory."  And the Gascon applied his hand to his breast, as if he
were actually seeking the place where his heart was.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! wretch!" murmured he,
smiling with bitterness.  "Ah! poor mortal species!  You hoped,
for an instant, that you had not a heart, and now you find you
have one - bad courtier as thou art, - and even one of the most
seditious.  You have a heart which speaks to you in favor of M.
Fouquet.  And what is M. Fouquet, when the king is in question? -
A conspirator, a real conspirator, who did not even give himself
the trouble to conceal his being a conspirator; therefore, what a
weapon would you not have against him, if his good grace, and his
intelligence had not made a scabbard for that weapon.  An armed
revolt! - for, in fact, M. Fouquet has been guilty of an armed
revolt.  Thus, while the king vaguely suspects M. Fouquet of
rebellion, I know it - I could prove that M. Fouquet had caused
the shedding of the blood of his majesty's subjects.  Now, then,
let us see.  Knowing all that, and holding my tongue, what
further would this heart wish in return for a kind action of M.
Fouquet's, for an advance of fifteen thousand livres, for a
diamond worth a thousand pistoles, for a smile in which there was
as much bitterness as kindness? - I save his life."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Now, then, I hope,"
continued the musketeer, "that this imbecile of a heart is going
to preserve silence, and so be fairly quits with M. Fouquet. 
Now, then, the king becomes my sun, and as my heart is quits with
M. Fouquet, let him beware who places himself between me and my
sun!  Forward, for his majesty Louis XIV.! - Forward !"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                These reflections were the
only impediments which were able to retard the progress of
D'Artagnan.  These reflections once made, he increased the speed
of his horse.  But, however perfect his horse Zephyr might be, it
could not hold out at such a pace forever.  The day after his
departure from Paris, his mount was left at Chartres, at the
house of an old friend D'Artagnan had met with in an
<i>h&ocirc;telier</i> of that city.  From that moment the
musketeer travelled on post-horses.  Thanks to this mode of
locomotion, he traversed the space separating Chartres from
Ch&acirc;teaubriand.  In the last of these two cities, far enough
from the coast to prevent any one guessing that D'Artagnan wished
to reach the sea - far enough from Paris to prevent all suspicion
of his being a messenger from Louis XIV., whom D'Artagnan had
called his sun, without suspecting that he who was only at
present a rather poor star in the heaven of royalty, would, one
day, make that star his emblem; the messenger of Louis XIV., we
say, quitted his post and purchased a <i>bidet</i> of the meanest
appearance, - one of those animals which an officer of the
cavalry would never choose, for fear of being disgraced. 
Excepting the color, this new acquisition recalled to the mind of
D'Artagnan the famous orange-colored horse, with which, or rather
upon which, he had made his first appearance in the world.  Truth
to say, from the moment he crossed this new steed, it was no
longer D'Artagnan who was travelling, - it was a good man clothed
in an iron-gray <i>justaucorps</i>, brown
<i>haut-de-chausses</i>, holding the medium between a priest and
a layman; that which brought him nearest to the churchman was,
that D'Artagnan had placed on his head a <i>calotte</i> of
threadbare velvet, and over the <i>calotte</i>, a large black
hat; no more sword, a stick hung by a cord to his wrist, but to
which, he promised himself, as an unexpected auxiliary, to join,
upon occasion, a good dagger, ten inches long, concealed under
his cloak.  The <i>bidet</i> purchased at Ch&acirc;teaubriand
completed the metamorphosis; it was called, or rather D'Artagnan
called if, Furet (ferret).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "If I have changed Zephyr
into Furet," said D'Artagnan, "I must make some diminutive or
other of my own name.  So, instead of D'Artagnan, I will be
Agnan, short; that is a concession which I naturally owe to my
gray coat, my round hat, and my rusty <i>calotte</i>."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Monsieur d'Artagnan
traveled, then, pretty easily upon Furet, who ambled like a true
butter-woman's pad, and who, with his amble, managed cheerfully
about twelve leagues a day, upon four spindle-shanks, of which
the practiced eye of D'Artagnan had appreciated the strength and
safety beneath the thick mass of hair which covered them. 
Jogging along, the traveler took notes, studied the country,
which he traversed reserved and silent, ever seeking the most
plausible pretext for reaching Belle-&Icirc;le-en-Mer, and for
seeing everything without arousing suspicion.  In this manner, he
was enabled to convince himself of the importance the event
assumed in proportion as he drew near to it.  In this remote
country, in this ancient duchy of Bretagne, which was not France
at that period, and is not so even now, the people knew nothing
of the king of France.  They not only did not know him, but were
unwilling to know him.  One face - a single one - floated visibly
for them upon the political current.  Their ancient dukes no
longer ruled them; government was a void - nothing more.  In
place of the sovereign duke, the seigneurs of parishes reigned
without control; and, above these seigneurs, God, who has never
been forgotten in Bretagne.  Among these suzerains of
ch&acirc;teaux and belfries, the most powerful, the richest, the
most popular, was M. Fouquet, seigneur of Belle-Isle.  Even in
the country, even within sight of that mysterious isle, legends
and traditions consecrate its wonders.  Every one might not
penetrate it: the isle, of an extent of six leagues in length,
and six in breadth, was a seignorial property, which the people
had for a long time respected, covered as it was with the name of
Retz, so redoubtable in the country.  Shortly after the erection
of this seignory into a marquistate, Belle-Isle passed to M.
Fouquet.  The celebrity of the isle did not date from yesterday;
its name, or rather its qualification, is traced back to the
remotest antiquity.  The ancients called it Kalon&egrave;se, from
two Greek words, signifying beautiful isle.  Thus, at a distance
of eighteen hundred years, it had borne, in another idiom, the
same name it still bears.  There was, then, something in itself
in this property of M. Fouquet's, besides its position of six
leagues off the coast of France; a position which makes it a
sovereign in its maritime solitude, like a majestic ship which
disdains roads, and proudly casts anchor in mid-ocean.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan learnt all this
without appearing the least in the world astonished.  He also
learnt the best way to get intelligence was to go to La
Roche-Bernard, a tolerably important city at the mouth of the
Vilaine.  Perhaps there he could embark; if not, crossing the
salt marshes, he would repair to Gu&eacute;rande or Le Croisic,
to wait for an opportunity to cross over to Belle-Isle.  He had
discovered, besides, since his departure from
Ch&acirc;teaubriand, that nothing would be impossible for Furet
under the impulsion of M. Agnan, and nothing to M. Agnan through
the initiative of Furet.  He prepared, then, to sup off a teal
and a <i>torteau</i>, in a hotel of La Roche-Bernard, and ordered
to be brought from the cellar, to wash down these two Breton
dishes, some cider, which, the moment it touched his lips, he
perceived to be more Breton still.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>B</span>efore taking
his place at table, D'Artagnan acquired, as was his custom, all
the information he could; but it is an axiom of curiosity, that
every man who wishes to question well and fruitfully ought in the
first place to lay himself open to questions.  D'Artagnan sought,
then, with his usual skill, a promising questioner in the
hostelry of La Roche-Bernard.  At the moment, there were in the
house, on the first story, two travelers either preparing for
supper, or at supper itself.  D'Artagnan had seen their nags in
the stable, and their equipages in the <i>salle</i>.  One
traveled with a lackey, undoubtedly a person of consideration; -
two Perche mares, sleek, sound beasts, were suitable means of
locomotion.  The other, a little fellow, a traveler of meagre
appearance, wearing a dusty surtout, dirty linen, and boots more
worn by the pavement than the stirrup, had come from Nantes with
a cart drawn by a horse so like Furet in color, that D'Artagnan
might have gone a hundred miles without finding a better match. 
This cart contained divers large packets wrapped in pieces of old
stuff.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That traveler yonder," said
D'Artagnan to himself, "is the man for my money.  He will do, he
suits me; I ought to do for him and suit him; M. Agnan, with the
gray doublet and the rusty <i>calotte</i>, is not unworthy of
supping with the gentleman of the old boots and still older
horse."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This said, D'Artagnan called
the host, and desired him to send his teal, <i>tourteau</i>, and
cider up to the chamber of the gentleman of modest exterior.  He
himself climbed, a plate in his hand, the wooden staircase which
led to the chamber, and began to knock at the door.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Come in!" said the
unknown.  D'Artagnan entered, with a simper on his lips, his
plate under his arm, his hat in one hand, his candle in the
other.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Excuse me, monsieur," said
he, "I am as you are, a traveler; I know no one in the hotel, and
I have the bad habit of losing my spirits when I eat alone; so
that my repast appears a bad one to me, and does not nourish me. 
Your face, which I saw just now, when you came down to have some
oysters opened, - your face pleased me much.  Besides, I have
observed you have a horse just like mine, and that the host, no
doubt on account of that resemblance, has placed them side by
side in the stable, where they appear to agree amazingly well
together.  I therefore, monsieur, do not see any reason why the
masters should be separated when the horses are united. 
Accordingly, I am come to request the pleasure of being admitted
to your table.  My name is Agnan, at your service, monsieur, the
unworthy steward of a rich seigneur, who wishes to purchase some
salt-mines in this country, and sends me to examine his future
acquisitions.  In truth, monsieur, I should be well pleased if my
countenance were as agreeable to you as yours is to me; for, upon
my honor, I am quite at your service."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The stranger, whom
D'Artagnan saw for the first time, - for before he had only
caught a glimpse of him, - the stranger had black and brilliant
eyes, a yellow complexion, a brow a little wrinkled by the weight
of fifty years, <i>bonhomie</i> in his features collectively, but
some cunning in his look.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "One would say," thought
D'Artagnan, "that this merry fellow has never exercised more than
the upper part of his head, his eyes, and his brain.  He must be
a man of science: his mouth, nose, and chin signify absolutely
nothing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," replied the
latter, with whose mind and person we have been making so free,
"you do me much honor; not that I am ever <i>ennuy&eacute;</i>,
for I have," added he, smiling, "a company which amuses me
always: but, never mind that, I am happy to receive you."  But
when saying this, the man with the worn boots cast an uneasy look
at his table, from which the oysters had disappeared, and upon
which there was nothing left but a morsel of salt bacon.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," D'Artagnan
hastened to say, "the host is bringing me up a pretty piece of
roasted poultry and a superb <i>tourteau</i>."  D'Artagnan had
read in the look of his companion, however rapidly it
disappeared, the fear of an attack by a parasite: he divined
justly.  At this opening, the features of the man of modest
exterior relaxed; and, as if he had watched the moment for his
entrance, as D'Artagnan spoke, the host appeared, bearing the
announced dishes.  The <i>tourteau</i> and the teal were added to
the morsel of broiled bacon; D'Artagnan and his guest bowed, sat
down opposite to each other, and, like two brothers, shared the
bacon and the other dishes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," said D'Artagnan,
"you must confess that association is a wonderful thing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How so?" replied the
stranger, with his mouth full.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, I will tell you,"
replied D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The stranger gave a short
truce to the movement of his jaws, in order to hear the
better.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In the first place,"
continued D'Artagnan, "instead of one candle, which each of us
had, we have two."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is true!" said the
stranger, struck with the extreme lucidity of the
observation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then I see that you eat my
<i>tourteau</i> in preference, whilst I, in preference, eat your
bacon."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is true again."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And then, in addition to
being better lighted and eating what we prefer, I place the
pleasure of your company."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Truly, monsieur, you are
very jovial," said the unknown, cheerfully.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur; jovial, as
all people are who carry nothing on their minds, or, for that
matter, in their heads.  Oh!  I can see it is quite another sort
of thing with you," continued D'Artagnan; "I can read in your
eyes all sorts of genius."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, monsieur!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Come, confess one
thing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What is that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That you are a learned
man."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Ma foi!</i>
monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Hein?</i>"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Almost."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Come, then!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am an author."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "There!" cried D'Artagnan,
clapping his hands, "I knew I could not be deceived!  It is a
miracle!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What, shall I have the
honor of passing the evening in the society of an author, of a
celebrated author, perhaps?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!" said the unknown,
blushing, "celebrated, monsieur, celebrated is not the word."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Modest!" cried D'Artagnan,
transported, "he is modest!"  Then, turning towards the stranger,
with a character of blunt <i>bonhomie</i>: "But tell me at least
the name of your works, monsieur; for you will please to observe
you have not told me your name, and I have been forced to divine
your genius."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My name is Jupenet,
monsieur," said the author.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A fine name! a grand name!
upon my honor; and I do not know why - pardon me the mistake, if
it be one - but surely I have heard that name somewhere."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have made verses," said
the poet, modestly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! that is it, then; I
have heard them read."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A tragedy."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I must have seen it
played."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The poet blushed again, and
said: "I do not think that can be the case, for my verses have
never been printed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, then, it must have
been the tragedy which informed me of your name."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are again mistaken, for
MM. the comedians of the H&ocirc;tel de Bourgogne, would have
nothing to do with it," said the poet, with a smile, the receipt
for which certain sorts of pride alone knew the secret. 
D'Artagnan bit his lips.  "Thus, then, you see, monsieur,"
continued the poet, "you are in error on my account, and that not
being at all known to you, you have never heard tell of me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! that confounds me. 
That name, Jupenet, appears to me, nevertheless, a fine name, and
quite as worthy of being known as those of MM. Corneille, or
Rotrou, or Garnier.  I hope, monsieur, you will have the goodness
to repeat to me a part of your tragedy presently, by way of
dessert, for instance.  That will be sugared roast meat, -
<i>mordioux!</i>  Ah! pardon me, monsieur, that was a little oath
which escaped me, because it is a habit with my lord and master. 
I sometimes allow myself to usurp that little oath, as it seems
in pretty good taste.  I take this liberty only in his absence,
please to observe, for you may understand that in his presence -
but, in truth, monsieur, this cider is abominable; do you not
think so?  And besides, the pot is of such an irregular shape it
will not stand on the table."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Suppose we were to make it
level?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To be sure; but with
what?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "With this knife."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And the teal, with what
shall we cut that up?  Do you not, by chance, mean to touch the
teal?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Certainly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, then - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Wait."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                And the poet rummaged in his
pocket, and drew out a piece of brass, oblong, quadrangular,
about a line in thickness, and an inch and a half in length.  But
scarcely had this little piece of brass seen the light, than the
poet appeared to have committed an imprudence, and made a
movement to put it back again in his pocket.  D'Artagnan
perceived this, for he was a man that nothing escaped.  He
stretched forth his hand towards the piece of brass: "Humph! that
which you hold in your hand is pretty; will you allow me to look
at it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Certainly," said the poet,
who appeared to have yielded too soon to a first impulse. 
"Certainly, you may look at it: but it will be in vain for you to
look at it," added he, with a satisfied air; "if I were not to
tell you its use, you would never guess it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan had seized as an
avowal the hesitation of the poet, and his eagerness to conceal
the piece of brass which a first movement had induced him to take
out of his pocket.  His attention, therefore, once awakened on
this point, he surrounded himself with a circumspection which
gave him a superiority on all occasions.  Besides, whatever M.
Jupenet might say about it, by a simple inspection of the object,
he perfectly well knew what it was.  It was a character in
printing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Can you guess, now, what
this is?" continued the poet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No," said D'Artagnan, "no,
<i>ma foi!</i>"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, monsieur," said M.
Jupenet, "this little piece of metal is a printing letter."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bah!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A capital."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Stop, stop, stop," said
D'Artagnan, opening his eyes very innocently.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur, a capital;
the first letter of my name."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And this is a letter, is
it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, I will confess one
thing to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And what is that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, I will not, I was going
to say something stupid."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, no," said Master
Jupenet, with a patronizing air.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, then, I cannot
comprehend, if that is a letter, how you can make a word."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A word?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, a printed word."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, that's very easy."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Let me see."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Does it interest you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Enormously."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, I will explain the
thing to you.  Attend."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am attending."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This is it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Look attentively."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am looking."  D'Artagnan,
in fact, appeared absorbed in observations.  Jupenet drew from
his pocket seven or eight other pieces of brass smaller than the
first.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, ah," said
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You have, then, a whole
printing-office in your pocket.  <i>Peste!</i> that is curious,
indeed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is it not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good God, what a number of
things we learn by traveling."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To your health!" said
Jupenet, quite enchanted.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To yours, <i>mordioux</i>,
to yours.  But - an instant - not in this cider.  It is an
abominable drink, unworthy of a man who quenches his thirst at
the Hippocrene fountain - is not it so you call your fountain,
you poets?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur, our fountain
is so called.  That comes from two Greek words - <i>hippos</i>,
which means a horse, and - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," interrupted
D'Artagnan, "you shall drink of a liquor which comes from one
single French word, and is none the worse for that - from the
word <i>grape</i>; this cider gives me the heartburn.  Allow me
to inquire of your host if there is not a good bottle of
Beaugency, or of the Ceran growth, at the back of the large bins
in his cellar."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The host, being sent for,
immediately attended.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," interrupted the
poet, "take care, we shall not have time to drink the wine,
unless we make great haste, for I must take advantage of the tide
to secure the boat."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What boat?" asked
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why the boat which sets out
for Belle-Isle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah - for Belle-Isle," said
the musketeer, "that is good."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bah! you will have plenty
of time, monsieur," replied the <i>h&ocirc;telier</i>, uncorking
the bottle, "the boat will not leave this hour."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But who will give me
notice?" said the poet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your fellow-traveler,"
replied the host.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But I scarcely know
him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "When you hear him
departing, it will be time for you to go."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is he going to Belle-Isle,
likewise, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The traveler who has a
lackey?" asked D'Artagnan.  "He is some gentleman, no doubt?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I know nothing of him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What! - know nothing of
him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, all I know is, that he
is drinking the same wine as you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Peste!</i> - that is a
great honor for us," said D'Artagnan, filling his companion's
glass, whilst the host went out.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So," resumed the poet,
returning to his dominant ideas, "you never saw any printing
done?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Never."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, then, take the
letters thus, which compose the word, you see: A B; <i>ma
foi!</i> here is an R, two E E, then a G."  And he assembled the
letters with a swiftness and skill which did not escape the eye
of D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">               
"<i>Abr&eacute;g&eacute;</i>," said he, as he ended.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good!" said D'Artagnan;
"here are plenty of letters got together; but how are they kept
so?"  And he poured out a second glass for the poet.  M. Jupenet
smiled like a man who has an answer for everything; then he
pulled out - still from his pocket - a little metal ruler,
composed of two parts, like a carpenter's rule, against which he
put together, and in a line, the characters, holding them under
his left thumb.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And what do you call that
little metal ruler?" said D'Artagnan, "for, I suppose, all these
things have names."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This is called a
composing-stick," said Jupenet; "it is by the aid of this stick
that the lines are formed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Come, then, I was not
mistaken in what I said; you have a press in your pocket," said
D'Artagnan, laughing with an air of simplicity so stupid, that
the poet was completely his dupe.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No," replied he; "but I am
too lazy to write, and when I have a verse in my head, I print it
immediately.  That is a labor spared."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Mordioux!</i>" thought
D'Artagnan to himself, "this must be cleared up."  And under a
pretext, which did not embarrass the musketeer, who was fertile
in expedients, he left the table, went downstairs, ran to the
shed under which stood the poet's little cart, and poked the
point of his poniard into the stuff which enveloped one of the
packages, which he found full of types, like those which the poet
had in his pocket.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Humph!" said D'Artagnan, "I
do not yet know whether M. Fouquet wishes to fortify Belle-Isle;
but, at all events, here are some spiritual munitions for the
castle."  Then, enchanted with his rich discovery, he ran
upstairs again, and resumed his place at the table.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan had learnt what
he wished to know.  He, however, remained, none the less, face to
face with his partner, to the moment when they heard from the
next room symptoms of a person's being about to go out.  The
printer was immediately on foot; he had given orders for his
horse to be got ready.  His carriage was waiting at the door. 
The second traveler got into his saddle, in the courtyard, with
his lackey.  D'Artagnan followed Jupenet to the door; he embarked
his cart and horse on board the boat.  As to the opulent
traveler, he did the same with his two horses and servant.  But
all the wit D'Artagnan employed in endeavoring to find out his
name was lost - he could learn nothing.  Only he took such notice
of his countenance, that it was impressed upon his mind forever. 
D'Artagnan had a great inclination to embark with the two
travelers, but an interest more powerful than curiosity - that of
success - repelled him from the shore, and brought him back again
to the hostelry.  He entered with a sigh, and went to bed
directly in order to be ready early in the morning with fresh
ideas and the sage counsel of sufficing sleep.</p>

D'Artagnan saddled Furet, who had fared sumptuously all night,
devouring the remainder of the oats and hay left by his
companions.  The musketeer sifted all he possibly could out of
the host, who he found cunning, mistrustful, and devoted, body
and soul, to M. Fouquet.  In order not to awaken the suspicions
of this man, he carried on his fable of being a probable
purchaser of some salt-mines.  To have embarked for Belle-Isle at
Roche-Bernard, would have been to expose himself still further to
comments which had, perhaps, been already made, and would be
carried to the castle.  Moreover, it was singular that this
traveler and his lackey should have remained a mystery to
D'Artagnan, in spite of all the questions addressed by him to the
host, who appeared to know him perfectly well.  The musketeer
then made some inquiries concerning the salt-mines, and took the
road to the marshes, leaving the sea on his right, and
penetrating into that vast and desolate plain which resembles a
sea of mud, of which, here and there, a few crests of salt silver
the undulations.  Furet walked admirably, with his little nervous
legs, along the foot-wide causeways which separate the
salt-mines.  D'Artagnan, aware of the consequences of a fall,
which would result in a cold bath, allowed him to go as he liked,
contenting himself with looking at, on the horizon, three rocks,
that rose up like lance-blades from the bosom of the plain,
destitute of verdure.  Piriac, the bourgs of Batz and Le Croisic,
exactly resembling each other, attracted and suspended his
attention.  If the traveler turned round, the better to make his
observations, he saw on the other side an horizon of three other
steeples, Gu&eacute;rande, Le Pouliguen, and Saint-Joachim,
which, in their circumference, represented a set of skittles, of
which he and Furet were but the wandering ball.  Piriac was the
first little port on his right.  He went thither, with the names
of the principal salters on his lips.  At the moment he reached
the little port of Piriac, five large barges, laden with stone,
were leaving it.  It appeared strange to D'Artagnan, that stones
should be leaving a country where none are found.  He had
recourse to all the amenity of M. Agnan to learn from the people
of the port the cause of this singular arrangement.  An old
fisherman replied to M. Agnan, that the stones very certainly did
not come from Piriac or the marshes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Where do they come from,
then?" asked the musketeer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, they come from
Nantes and Paimb&oelig;uf."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Where are they going,
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, to
Belle-Isle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! ah!" said D'Artagnan,
in the same tone he had assumed to tell the printer that his
character interested him; "are they building at Belle-Isle,
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, yes, monsieur, M.
Fouquet has the walls of the castle repaired every year."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is in ruins, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is old."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thank you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The fact is," said
D'Artagnan to himself, "nothing is more natural; every proprietor
has a right to repair his own property.  It would be like telling
me I was fortifying the Image-de-Notre-Dame, when I was simply
obliged to make repairs.  In good truth, I believe false reports
have been made to his majesty, and he is very likely to be in the
wrong."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You must confess,"
continued he then, aloud, and addressing the fisherman - for his
part of a suspicious man was imposed upon him by the object even
of his mission - "you must confess, my dear monsieur, that these
stones travel in a very curious fashion."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How so?" said the
fisherman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "They come from Nantes or
Paimb&oelig;uf by the Loire, do they not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "With the tide."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is convenient, - I
don't say it is not; but why do they not go straight from
Saint-Nazaire to Belle-Isle?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eh! because the
<i>chalands</i> (barges) are fresh-water boats, and take the sea
badly," replied the fisherman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is not sufficient
reason."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Pardon me, monsieur, one
may see that you have never been a sailor," added the fisherman,
not without a sort of disdain.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Explain to me, if you
please, my good man.  It appears to me that to come from
Paimb&oelig;uf to Piriac, and go from Piriac to Belle-Isle, is as
if we went from Roche-Bernard to Nantes, and from Nantes to
Piriac."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "By water that would be the
nearest way," replied the fisherman imperturbably.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But there is an elbow?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The fisherman shook his
head.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The shortest road from one
place to another is a straight line," continued D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You forget the tide,
monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well! take the tide."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And the wind."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, and the wind."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Without doubt; the current
of the Loire carries barks almost as far as Le Croisic.  If they
want to lie by a little, or to refresh the crew, they come to
Piriac along the coast; from Piriac they find another inverse
current, which carries them to the Isle-Dumal, two leagues and a
half."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Granted."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "There the current of the
Vilaine throws them upon another isle, the Isle of Hoedic."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I agree with that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, monsieur, from that
isle to Belle-Isle the way is quite straight.  The sea, broken
both above and below, passes like a canal - like a mirror between
the two isles; the <i>chalands</i> glide along upon it like ducks
upon the Loire; that's how it is."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It does not signify," said
the obstinate M. Agnan; "it is a long way round."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! yes; but M. Fouquet
will  have it so," replied, as conclusive, the fisherman, taking
off his woolen cap at the enunciation of that respected name.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                A look from D'Artagnan, a
look as keen and piercing as a sword-blade, found nothing in the
heart of the old man but a simple confidence - on his features,
nothing but satisfaction and indifference.  He said, "M. Fouquet
will have it so," as he would have said, "God has willed it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan had already
advanced too far in this direction; besides, the <i>chalands</i>
being gone, there remained nothing at Piriac but a single bark -
that of the old man, and it did not look fit for sea without
great preparation.  D'Artagnan therefore patted Furet, who, as a
new proof of his charming character, resumed his march with his
feet in the salt-mines, and his nose to the dry wind, which bends
the furze and the broom of this country.  They reached Le Croisic
about five o'clock.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                If D'Artagnan had been a
poet, it was a beautiful spectacle: the immense strand of a
league or more, the sea covers at high tide, and which, at the
reflux, appears gray and desolate, strewed with polypi and
seaweed, with pebbles sparse and white, like bones in some vast
old cemetery.  But the soldier, the politician, and the ambitious
man, had no longer the sweet consolation of looking towards
heaven to read there a hope or a warning.  A red sky signifies
nothing to such people but wind and disturbance.  White and
fleecy clouds upon the azure only say that the sea will be smooth
and peaceful.  D'Artagnan found the sky blue, the breeze embalmed
with saline perfumes, and he said: "I will embark with the first
tide, if it be but in a nutshell."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                At Le Croisic as at Piriac,
he had remarked enormous heaps of stone lying along the shore. 
These gigantic walls, diminished every tide by the barges for
Belle-Isle, were, in the eyes of the musketeer, the consequence
and the proof of what he had well divined at Piriac.  Was it a
wall that M. Fouquet was constructing?  Was it a fortification
that he was erecting?  To ascertain that, he must make fuller
observations.  D'Artagnan put Furet into a stable; supped, went
to bed, and on the morrow took a walk upon the port or rather
upon the shingle.  Le Croisic has a port of fifty feet; it has a
look-out which resembles an enormous <i>brioche</i> (a kind of
cake) elevated on a dish.  The flat strand is the dish.  Hundreds
of barrowsful of earth amalgamated with pebbles, and rounded into
cones, with sinuous passages between, are look-outs and
<i>brioches</i> at the same time.  It is so now, and it was so
two hundred years ago, only the <i>brioche</i> was not so large,
and probably there were to be seen to trellises of lath around
the <i>brioche</i>, which constitute an ornament, planted like
<i>gardes-fous</i> along the passages that wind towards the
little terrace.  Upon the shingle lounged three or four fishermen
talking about sardines and shrimps.  D'Artagnan, with his eyes
animated by a rough gayety, and a smile upon his lips, approached
these fishermen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Any fishing going on
to-day?" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur," replied one
of them, "we are only waiting for the tide."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Where do you fish, my
friends?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Upon the coasts,
monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Which are the best
coasts?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, that is all according. 
The tour of the isles, for example?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, but they are a long
way off, those isles, are they not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Not very; four
leagues."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Four leagues!  That is a
voyage."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The fishermen laughed in M.
Agnan's face.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Hear me, then," said the
latter with an air of simple stupidity; "four leagues off you
lose sight of land, do you not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, not always."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, it is a long way - too
long, or else I would have asked you to take me aboard, and to
show me what I have never seen."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What is that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A live sea-fish."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur comes from the
province?" said a fisherman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, I come from
Pairs."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The Breton shrugged his
shoulders; then:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Have you ever seen M.
Fouquet in Paris?" asked he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Often," replied
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Often!" repeated the
fishermen, closing their circle round the Parisian.  "Do you know
him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A little; he is the
intimate friend of my master."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah!" said the fishermen, in
astonishment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And," said D'Artagnan, "I
have seen all his ch&acirc;teaux of Saint Mand&eacute;, of Vaux,
and his hotel in Paris."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is that a fine place?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Superb."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is not so fine a place
as Belle-Isle," said the fisherman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bah!" cried M. d'Artagnan,
breaking into a laugh so loud that he angered all his
auditors.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is very plain that you
have never seen Belle-Isle," said the most curious of the
fishermen.  "Do you know that there are six leagues of it, and
that there are such trees on it as cannot be equaled even at
Nates-sur-le-Foss&eacute;?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Trees in the sea!" cried
D'Artagnan; "well, I should like to see them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That can be easily done; we
are fishing at the Isle de Hoedic - come with us.  From that
place you will see, as a Paradise, the black trees of Belle-Isle
against the sky; you will see the white line of the castle, which
cuts the horizon of the sea like a blade."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh," said D'Artagnan, "that
must be very beautiful.  But do you know there are a hundred
belfries at M. Fouquet's ch&acirc;teau of Vaux?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The Breton raised his head
in profound admiration, but he was not convinced.  "A hundred
belfries!  Ah, that may be; but Belle-Isle is finer than that. 
Should you like to see Belle-Isle?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is that possible?" asked
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, with permission of the
governor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But I do not know the
governor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "As you know M. Fouquet, you
can tell your name."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, my friends, I am not a
gentleman."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Everybody enters
Belle-Isle," continued the fisherman in his strong, pure
language, "provided he means no harm to Belle-Isle or its
master."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                A slight shudder crept over
the body of the musketeer.  "That is true," thought he.  Then
recovering himself, "If I were sure," said he, "not to be
sea-sick."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What, upon <i>her?</i>"
said the fisherman, pointing with pride to his pretty
round-bottomed bark</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, you almost persuade
me," cried M. Agnan; "I will go and see Belle-Isle, but they will
not admit me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "We shall enter, safe
enough."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You!  What for?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, <i>dame!</i> to sell
fish to the corsairs."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ha!  Corsairs - what do you
mean?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, I mean that M.
Fouquet is having two corsairs built to chase the Dutch and the
English, and we sell our fish to the crews of those little
vessels."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Come, come!" said
D'Artagnan to himself - "better and better.  A printing-press,
bastions, and corsairs!  Well, M. Fouquet is not an enemy to be
despised, as I presumed to fancy.  He is worth the trouble of
travelling to see him nearer."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "We set out at half-past
five," said the fisherman gravely.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am quite ready, and I
will not leave you now."  So D'Artagnan saw the fishermen haul
their barks to meet the tide with a windlass.  The sea rose; M.
Agnan allowed himself to be hoisted on board, not without
sporting a little fear and awkwardness, to the amusement of the
young beach-urchins who watched him with their large intelligent
eyes.  He laid himself down upon a folded sail, not interfering
with anything whilst the bark prepared for sea; and, with its
large square sail, it was fairly out within two hours.  The
fishermen, who prosecuted their occupation as they proceeded, did
not perceive that their passenger had  not become pale, neither
groaned nor suffered; that in spite of that horrible tossing and
rolling of the bark, to which no hand imparted direction, the
novice passenger had preserved his presence of mind and his
appetite.  They fished, and their fishing was sufficiently
fortunate.  To lines bated with prawn, soles came, with numerous
gambols, to bite.  Two nets had already been broken by the
immense weight of congers and haddocks; three sea-eels plowed the
hold with their slimy folds and their dying contortions. 
D'Artagnan brought them good luck; they told him so.  The soldier
found the occupation so pleasant, that he put his hand to the
work - that is to say, to the lines - and uttered roars of joy,
and <i>mordioux</i> enough to have astonished his musketeers
themselves, every time that a shock given to his line by the
captured fish required the play of the muscles of his arm, and
the employment of his best dexterity.  The party of pleasure had
made him forget his diplomatic mission.  He was struggling with a
very large conger, and holding fast with one hand to the side of
the vessel, in order to seize with the other the gaping jowl of
his antagonist, when the master said to him, "Take care they
don't see you from Belle-Isle!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                These words produced the
same effect upon D'Artagnan as the hissing of the first bullet on
a day of battle; he let go of both line and conger, which,
dragging each other, returned again to the water.  D'Artagnan
perceived, within half a league at most, the blue and marked
profile of the rocks of Belle-Isle, dominated by the majestic
whiteness of the castle.  In the distance, the land with its
forests and verdant plains; cattle on the grass.  This was what
first attracted the attention of the musketeer.  The sun darted
its rays of gold upon the sea, raising a shining mist round this
enchanted isle.  Little could be seen of it, owing to this
dazzling light, but the salient points; every shadow was strongly
marked, and cut with bands of darkness the luminous fields and
walls.  "Eh! eh!" said D'Artagnan, at the aspect of those masses
of black rocks, "these are fortifications which do not stand in
need of any engineer to render a landing difficult.  How the
devil can a landing be effected on that isle which God has
defended so completely?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This way," replied the
patron of the bark, changing the sail, and impressing upon the
rudder a twist which turned the boat in the direction of a pretty
little port, quite coquettish, round, and newly battlemented.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What the devil do I see
yonder?" said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You see Locmaria," replied
the fisherman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, but there?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is Bangor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And further on?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sauzon, and then Le
Palais."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Mordioux!</i>  It is a
world.  Ah! there are some soldiers."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "There are seventeen hundred
men in Belle-Isle, monsieur," replied the fisherman, proudly. 
"Do you know that the least garrison is of twenty companies of
infantry?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Mordioux!</i>" cried
D'Artagnan, stamping with his foot.  "His majesty was right
enough."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                They landed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>T</span>here is
always something in a landing, if it be only from the smallest
sea-boat - a trouble and a confusion which do not leave the mind
the liberty of which it stands in need in order to study at the
first glance the new locality presented to it.  The moveable
bridges, the agitated sailors, the noise of the water on the
pebbles, the cries and importunities of those who wait upon the
shores, are multiplied details of that sensation which is summed
up in one single result - hesitation.  It was not, then, till
after standing several minutes on the shore that D'Artagnan saw
upon the port, but more particularly in the interior of the isle,
an immense number of workmen in motion.  At his feet D'Artagnan
recognized the five <i>chalands</i> laden with rough stone he had
seen leave the port of Piriac.  The smaller stones were
transported to the shore by means of a chain formed by
twenty-five or thirty peasants.  The large stones were loaded on
trollies which conveyed them in the same direction as the others,
that is to say, towards the works, of which D'Artagnan could as
yet appreciate neither the strength nor the extent.  Everywhere
was to be seen an activity equal to that which Telemachus
observed on his landing at Salentum.  D'Artagnan felt a strong
inclination to penetrate into the interior; but he could not,
under the penalty of exciting mistrust, exhibit too much
curiosity.  He advanced then little by little, scarcely going
beyond the line formed by the fishermen on the beach, observing
everything, saying nothing, and meeting all suspicion that might
have been excited with a half-silly question or a polite bow. 
And yet, whilst his companions carried on their trade, giving or
selling their fish to the workmen or the inhabitants of the city,
D'Artagnan had gained by degrees, and, reassured by the little
attention paid to him, he began to cast an intelligent and
confident look upon the men and things that appeared before his
eyes.  And his very first glance fell on certain movements of
earth about which the eye of a soldier could not be mistaken.  At
the two extremities of the port, in order that their fires should
converge upon the great axis of the ellipse formed by the basin,
in the first place, two batteries had been raised, evidently
destined to receive flank pieces, for D'Artagnan saw the workmen
finishing the platform and making ready the demi-circumference in
wood upon which the wheels of the pieces might turn to embrace
every direction over the epaulement.  By the side of each of
these batteries other workmen were strengthening gabions filled
with earth, the lining of another battery.  The latter had
embrasures, and the overseer of the works called successively men
who, with cords, tied the <i>saucissons</i> and cut the lozenges
and right angles of turfs destined to retain the matting of the
embrasures.  By the activity displayed in these works, already so
far advanced, they might be considered as finished: they were not
yet furnished with their cannons, but the platforms had their
<i>g&icirc;tes</i> and their <i>madriers</i> all prepared; the
earth, beaten carefully, was consolidated; and supposing the
artillery to be on the island, in less than two or three days the
port might be completely armed.  That which astonished
D'Artagnan, when he turned his eyes from the coast batteries to
the fortifications of the city, was to see that Belle-Isle was
defended by an entirely new system, of which he had often heard
the Comte de la F&egrave;re speak as a wonderful advance, but of
which he had as yet never seen the application.  These
fortifications belonged neither to the Dutch method of Marollais,
nor to the French method of the Chevalier Antoine de Ville, but
to the system of Manesson Mallet, a skillful engineer, who about
six or eight years previously had quitted the service of Portugal
to enter that of France.  The works had this peculiarity, that
instead of rising above the earth, as did the ancient ramparts
destined to defend a city from escalades, they, on the contrary,
sank into it; and what created the height of the walls was the
depth of the ditches.  It did not take long to make D'Artagnan
perceive the superiority of such a system, which gives no
advantage to cannon.  Besides, as the <i>foss&eacute;s</i> were
lower than, or on a level with, the sea, these
<i>foss&eacute;s</i> could be instantly inundated by means of
subterranean sluices.  Otherwise, the works were almost complete,
and a group of workmen, receiving orders from a man who appeared
to be conductor of the works, were occupied in placing the last
stones.  A bridge of planks thrown over the <i>foss&eacute;s</i>
for the greater convenience of the maneuvers connected with the
barrows, joined the interior to the exterior.  With an air of
simple curiosity D'Artagnan asked if he might be permitted to
cross the bridge, and he was told that no order prevented it. 
Consequently he crossed the bridge, and advanced towards the
group.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This group was superintended
by the man whom D'Artagnan had already remarked, and who appeared
to be the engineer-in-chief.  A plan was lying open before him
upon a large stone forming a table, and at some paces from him a
crane was in action.  This engineer, who by his evident
importance first attracted the attention of D'Artagnan, wore a
<i>justaucorps</i>, which, from its sumptuousness, was scarcely
in harmony with the work he was employed in, that rather
necessitated the costume of a master-mason than of a noble.  He
was a man of immense stature and great square shoulders, and wore
a hat covered with feathers.  He gesticulated in the most
majestic manner, and appeared, for D'Artagnan only saw his back,
to be scolding the workmen for their idleness and want of
strength.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan continued to draw
nearer.  At that moment the man with the feathers ceased to
gesticulate, and, with his hands placed upon his knees, was
following, half-bent, the effort of six workmen to raise a block
of hewn stone to the top of a piece of timber destined to support
that stone, so that the cord of the crane might be passed under
it.  The six men, all on one side of the stone, united their
efforts to raise it to eight or ten inches from the ground,
sweating and blowing, whilst a seventh got ready for when there
should be daylight enough beneath it to slide in the roller that
was to support it.  But the stone had already twice escaped from
their hands before gaining a sufficient height for the roller to
be introduced.  There can be no doubt that every time the stone
escaped them, they bounded quickly backwards, to keep their feet
from being crushed by the refalling stone.  Every time, the
stone, abandoned by them, sunk deeper into the damp earth, which
rendered the operation more and more difficult.  A third effort
was followed by no better success, but with progressive
discouragement.  And yet, when the six men were bent towards the
stone, the man with the feathers had himself, with a powerful
voice, given the word of command, "<i>Ferme!</i>" which regulates
maneuvers of strength.  Then he drew himself up.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! oh!" said he, "what is
this all about?  Have I to do with men of straw?  <i>Corne de
b&oelig;uf!</i> stand on one side, and you shall see how this is
to be done."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Peste!</i>" said
D'Artagnan, "will he pretend to raise that rock? that would be a
sight worth looking at."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The workmen, as commanded by
the engineer, drew back with their ears down, and shaking their
heads, with the exception of the one who held the plank, who
prepared to perform the office.  The man with the feathers went
up to the stone, stooped, slipped his hands under the face lying
upon the ground, stiffened his Herculean muscles, and without a
strain, with a slow motion, like that of a machine, lifted the
end of the rock a foot from the ground.  The workman who held the
plank profited by the space thus given him, and slipped the
roller under the stone.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That's the way," said the
giant, not letting the rock fall again, but placing it upon its
support.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Mordioux!</i>" cried
D'Artagnan, "I know but one man capable of such a feat of
strength."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Hein!</i>" cried the
colossus, turning round.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Porthos!" murmured
D'Artagnan, seized with stupor, "Porthos at Belle-Isle!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                On his part, the man with
the feathers fixed his eyes upon the disguised lieutenant, and,
in spite of his metamorphosis, recognized him.  "D'Artagnan!"
cried he; and the color mounted to his face.  "Hush!" said he to
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Hush!" in his turn, said
the musketeer.  In fact, if Porthos had just been discovered by
D'Artagnan, D'Artagnan had just been discovered by Porthos.  The
interest of the particular secret of each struck them both at the
same instant.  Nevertheless the first movement of the two men was
to throw their arms around each other.  What they wished to
conceal from the bystanders, was not their friendship, but their
names.  But, after the embrace, came reflection.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What the devil brings
Porthos to Belle-Isle, lifting stones?" said D'Artagnan; only
D'Artagnan uttered that question in a low voice.  Less strong in
diplomacy than his friend, Porthos thought aloud.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How the devil did you come
to Belle-Isle?" asked he of D'Artagnan; "and what do you want to
do here?"  It was necessary to reply without hesitation.  To
hesitate in answer to Porthos would have been a check, for which
the self-love of D'Artagnan would never have consoled itself.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Pardieu!</i> my friend,
I am at Belle-Isle because <i>you</i> are here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, bah!" said Porthos,
visibly stupefied with the argument and seeking to account for it
to himself, with the felicity of deduction we know to be
particular to him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Without doubt," continued
D'Artagnan, unwilling to give his friend time to recollect
himself, "I have been to see you at Pierrefonds."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Indeed!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you did not find me
there?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, but I found
Mouston."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is he well?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Peste!</i>"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, but Mouston did not
tell you I was here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why should he <i>not?</i> 
Have I, perchance, deserved to lose his confidence?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No; but he did not know
it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well; that is a reason at
least that does not offend my self-love."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then how did you manage to
find me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My dear friend, a great
noble like you always leaves traced behind him on his passage;
and I should think but poorly of myself, if I were not sharp
enough to follow the traces of my friends."  This explanation,
flattering as it was, did not entirely satisfy Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But I left no traces behind
me, for I came here disguised," said Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah!  You came disguised did
you?" said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And how?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "As a miller."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And do you think a great
noble, like you, Porthos, can affect common manners so as to
deceive people?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, I swear to you my
friend, that I played my part so well that <i>everybody</i> was
deceived."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Indeed! so well, that I
have not discovered and joined you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes; but <i>how</i> did you
discover and join me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Stop a bit.  I was going to
tell you how.  Do you imagine Mouston - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! it was that fellow,
Mouston," said Porthos, gathering up those two triumphant arches
which served him for eyebrows.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But stop, I tell you - it
was no fault of Mouston's because he was ignorant of where you
were."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I know he was; and that is
why I am in such haste to understand - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! how impatient you are,
Porthos."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "When I do not comprehend, I
am terrible."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, you will understand. 
Aramis wrote to you at Pierrefonds, did he not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And he told you to come
before the equinox."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is true."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well! that is it," said
D'Artagnan, hoping that this reason would mystify Porthos. 
Porthos appeared to give himself up to a violent mental
labor.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, yes," said he, "I
understand.  As Aramis told me to come before the equinox, you
have understood that that was to join him.  You then inquired
where Aramis was, saying to yourself, 'Where Aramis is, there
Porthos will be.'  You have learnt that Aramis was in Bretagne,
and you said to yourself, 'Porthos is in Bretagne.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Exactly.  In good truth,
Porthos, I cannot tell why you have not turned conjuror.  So you
understand that, arriving at Roche-Bernard, I heard of the
splendid fortifications going on at Belle-Isle.  The account
raised my curiosity, I embarked in a fishing boat, without
dreaming that you were here: I came, and I saw a monstrous fine
fellow lifting a stone Ajax could not have stirred.  I cried out,
'Nobody but the Baron de Bracieux could have performed such a
feat of strength.'  You heard me, you turned round, you
recognized me, we embraced; and, <i>ma foi!</i> if you like, my
dear friend, we will embrace again."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! now all is explained,"
said Porthos; and he embraced D'Artagnan with so much friendship
as to deprive the musketeer of his breath for five minutes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, you are stronger than
ever," said D'Artagnan, "and still, happily, in your
<i>arms</i>."  Porthos saluted D'Artagnan with a gracious smile. 
During the five minutes D'Artagnan was recovering his breath, he
reflected that he had a very difficult part to play.  It was
necessary that he always should question and never reply.  By the
time his respiration returned, he had fixed his plans for the
campaign.</p>

immediately took the offensive.  "Now that I have told you all,
dear friend, or rather you have guessed all, tell me what you are
doing here, covered with dust and mud?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Porthos wiped his brow, and
looked around him with pride.  "Why, it appears," said he, "that
you may see what I am doing here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No doubt, no doubt, you
lift great stones."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! to show these idle
fellows what a <i>man</i> is," said Porthos, with contempt.  "But
you understand - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, that is not your place
to lift stones, although there are many whose place it is, who
cannot lift them as you do.  It was that which made me ask you,
just now.  What are you doing here, baron?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am studying topography,
chevalier."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are studying
topography?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes; but you - what are you
doing in that common dress?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan perceived he had
committed a fault in giving expression to his astonishment. 
Porthos had taken advantage of it, to retort with a question. 
"Why," said he, "you know I am a bourgeois, in fact; my dress,
then, has nothing astonishing in it, since it conforms with my
condition."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Nonsense! you are a
musketeer."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are wrong, my friend; I
have given in my resignation."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bah!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, <i>mon Dieu!</i>
yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you have abandoned the
service?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have quitted it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You have abandoned the
king?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Quite."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Porthos raised his arms
towards heaven, like a man who has heard extraordinary news. 
"Well, that <i>does</i> confound me," said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is nevertheless
true."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And what led you to form
such a resolution."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The king displeased me. 
Mazarin had disgusted me for a long time, as you know; so I threw
my cassock to the nettles."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But Mazarin is dead."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I know that well enough,
<i>parbleu!</i>  Only, at the period of his death, my resignation
had been given in and accepted two months.  Then, feeling myself
free, I set off for Pierrefonds, to see my friend Porthos.  I had
heard talk of the happy division you had made of your time, and I
wished, for a fortnight, to divide mine after your fashion."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My friend, you know that it
is not for a fortnight my house is open to you; it is for a year
- for ten years - for life."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thank you, Porthos."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! but perhaps you want
money - do you?" said Porthos, making something like fifty louis
chink in his pocket.  "In that case, you know - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, thank you; I am not in
want of anything.  I placed my savings with Planchet, who pays me
the interest of them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your savings?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, to be sure," said
D'Artagnan: "why should I not put by my savings, as well as
another, Porthos?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, there is no reason why;
on the contrary, I always suspected you - that is to say, Aramis
always suspected you to have savings.  For my own part, d'ye see,
I take no concern about the management of my household; but I
presume the savings of a musketeer must be small."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No doubt, relative to
yourself, Porthos, who are a millionaire; but you shall judge.  I
had laid by twenty-five thousand livres."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That's pretty well," said
Porthos, with an affable air.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And," continued D'Artagnan,
"on the twenty-eighth of last month I added to it two hundred
thousand livres more."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Porthos opened his large
eyes, which eloquently demanded of the musketeer, "Where the
devil did you steal such a sum as that, my dear friend?"  "Two
hundred thousand livres!" cried he, at length.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes; which, with the
twenty-five I had, and twenty thousand I have about me, complete
the sum of two hundred and forty-five thousand livres."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But tell me, whence comes
this fortune?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I will tell you all about
it presently, dear friend; but as you have, in the first place,
many things to tell me yourself, let us have my recital in its
proper order."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bravo!" said Porthos; "then
we are both rich.  But what can I have to relate to you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You have to relate to me
how Aramis came to be named - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! bishop of Vannes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That's it," said
D'Artagnan, "bishop of Vannes.  Dear Aramis! do you know how he
succeeded so well?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, yes; without reckoning
that he does not mean to stop there."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What! do you mean he will
not be contented with violet stockings, and that he wants a red
hat?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Hush! that is
<i>promised</i> him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bah! by the king?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "By somebody more powerful
than the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! the devil! Porthos:
what incredible things you tell me, my friend!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why incredible?  Is there
not <i>always</i> somebody in France more powerful than the
king?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, yes; in the time of
King Louis XIII. it was Cardinal Richelieu; in the time of the
regency it was Cardinal Mazarin.  In the time of Louis XIV. it is
M - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Go on."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is M. Fouquet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Jove! you have hit it the
first time."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So, then, I suppose it is
M. Fouquet who has promised Aramis the red hat."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Porthos assumed an air of
reserve.  "Dear friend," said he, "God preserve me from meddling
with the affairs of others, above all from revealing secrets it
may be to their interest to keep.  When you see Aramis, he will
tell you all he thinks he ought to tell you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are right, Porthos; and
you are quite a padlock for safety.  But, to revert to
yourself?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes," said Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You said just now you came
hither to study topography?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I did so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Tudieu!</i> my friend,
what fine things you will do!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How do you mean?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, these fortifications
are admirable."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is that your opinion?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Decidedly it is.  In truth,
to anything but a regular siege, Belle-Isle is absolutely
impregnable."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Porthos rubbed his hands. 
"That is my opinion," said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But who the devil has
fortified this paltry little place in this manner?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Porthos drew himself up
proudly: "Did I not tell you who?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do you not suspect?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No; all I can say is that
he is a man who has studied all the systems, and who appears to
me to have stopped at the best."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Hush!" said Porthos;
"consider my modesty, my dear D'Artagnan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In truth," replied the
musketeer, "can it be you - who - oh!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Pray - my dear friend -
"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You who have imagined,
traced, and combined between these bastions, these redans, these
curtains, these half-moons; and are preparing that covered
way?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I beg you - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You who have built that
lunette with its retiring angles and its salient edges?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My friend - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You who have given that
inclination to the openings of your embrasures, by means of which
you so effectively protect the men who serve the guns?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eh! <i>mon Dieu!</i>
yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!  Porthos, Porthos!  I
must bow down before you - I must admire you!  But you have
always concealed from us this superb, this incomparable genius. 
I hope, my dear friend, you will show me all this in detail."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Nothing more easy.  Here
lies my original sketch, my plan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Show it me."  Porthos led
D'Artagnan towards the stone that served him for a table, and
upon which the plan was spread.  At the foot of the plan was
written, in the formidable writing of Porthos, writing of which
we have already had occasion to speak: -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Instead of making use of
the square or rectangle, as has been done to this time, you will
suppose your place inclosed in a regular hexagon, this polygon
having the advantage of offering more angles than the
quadrilateral one.  Every side of your hexagon, of which you will
determine the length in proportion to the dimensions taken upon
the place, will be divided into two parts, and upon the middle
point you will elevate a perpendicular towards the center of the
polygon, which will equal in length the sixth part of the side. 
By the extremities of each side of the polygon, you will trace
two diagonals, which will cut the perpendicular.  These will form
the precise lines of your defense."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The devil!" said
D'Artagnan, stopping at this point of the demonstration; "why,
this is a complete system, Porthos."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Entirely," said Porthos. 
"Continue."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No; I have read enough of
it; but, since it is you, my dear Porthos, who direct the works,
what need have you of setting down your system so formally in
writing?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! my dear friend,
death!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How! death?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, we are all mortal, are
we not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is true," said
D'Artagnan; "you have a reply for everything, my friend."  And he
replaced the plan upon the stone.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                But however short the time
he had the plan in his hands, D'Artagnan had been able to
distinguish, under the enormous writing of Porthos, a much more
delicate hand, which reminded him of certain letters to Marie
Michon, with which he had been acquainted in his youth.  Only the
India-rubber had passed and repassed so often over this writing
that it might have escaped a less practiced eye than that of our
musketeer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bravo! my friend, bravo!"
said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And now you know all that
you want to know, do you not?" said Porthos, wheeling about.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Mordioux!</i> yes, only
do me one last favor, dear friend!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Speak, I am master
here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do me the pleasure to tell
me the name of that gentleman who is walking yonder."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Where, there?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Behind the soldiers."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Followed by a lackey?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Exactly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In company with a mean sort
of fellow, dressed in black?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, I mean him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is M.
G&eacute;tard."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And who is G&eacute;tard,
my friend?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He is the architect of the
house."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Of what house?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Of M. Fouquet's house."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! ah!" cried D'Artagnan,
"you are of the household of M. Fouquet, then, Porthos?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I! what do you mean by
that?" said the topographer, blushing to the top of his ears.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, you say the house,
when speaking of Belle-Isle, as if you were speaking of the
ch&acirc;teau of Pierrefonds."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Porthos bit his lip. 
"Belle-Isle, my friend," said he, "belongs to M. Fouquet, does it
not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, I believe so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "As Pierrefonds belongs to
me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I told you I believed so;
there are no two words to <i>that</i>."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Did you ever see a man
there who is accustomed to walk about with a ruler in his
hand?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No; but I might have seen
him there, if he really walked there."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, that gentleman is M.
Boulingrin."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who is M. Boulingrin?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Now we are coming to it. 
If, when this gentleman is walking with a ruler in his hand, any
one should ask me, - 'who is M. Boulingrin?'  I should reply: 'He
is the architect of the house.'  Well!  M. G&eacute;tard is the
Boulingrin of M. Fouquet.  But he has nothing to do with the
fortifications, which are my department alone; do you understand?
mine, absolutely mine."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! Porthos," cried
D'Artagnan, letting his arms fall as a conquered man gives up his
sword; "ah! my friend, you are not only a Herculean topographer,
you are, still further, a dialectician of the first water."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is it not powerfully
reasoned?" said Porthos: and he puffed and blew like the conger
which D'Artagnan had let slip from his hand.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And now," said D'Artagnan,
"that shabby-looking man, who accompanies M. G&eacute;tard, is he
also of the household of M. Fouquet?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! yes," said Porthos,
with contempt; "it is one M. Jupenet, or Juponet, a sort of
poet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who is come to establish
himself here?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I believe so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I thought M. Fouquet had
poets enough, yonder &ndash; Scud&egrave;ry, Loret,
P&eacute;lisson, La Fontaine?  If I must tell you the truth,
Porthos, that poet disgraces you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eh! - my friend; but what
saves us is that he is not here as a poet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "As what, then, is he?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "As printer.  And you make
me remember, I have a word to say to the <i>cuistre</i>."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Say it, then."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Porthos made a sign to
Jupenet, who perfectly recollected D'Artagnan, and did not care
to come nearer; which naturally produced another sign from
Porthos.  This was so imperative, he was obliged to obey.  As he
approached, "Come hither!" said Porthos.  "You only landed
yesterday and you have begun your tricks already."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How so, monsieur le baron?"
asked Jupenet, trembling.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your press was groaning all
night, monsieur," said Porthos, "and you prevented my sleeping,
<i>corne de b&oelig;uf!</i>"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur - " objected
Jupenet, timidly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You have nothing yet to
print: therefore you have no occasion to set your press going. 
What did you print last night?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur, a light poem of
my own composition."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Light! no, no, monsieur;
the press groaned pitifully beneath it.  Let it not happen
again.  Do you understand?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You promise me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I do, monsieur!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very well; this time I
pardon you.  Adieu!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The poet retreated as humbly
as he had approached.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, now we have combed
that fellow's head, let us breakfast."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes," replied D'Artagnan,
"let us breakfast."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Only," said Porthos, "I beg
you to observe, my friend, that we only have two hours for our
repast."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What would you have?  We
will try to make two hours suffice.  But why have you only two
hours?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Because it is high tide at
one o'clock, and, with the tide, I am going to Vannes.  But, as I
shall return to-morrow, my dear friend, you can stay here; you
shall be master; I have a good cook and a good cellar."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No," interrupted
D'Artagnan, "better than that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are going to Vannes,
you say?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To a certainty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To see Aramis?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well!  I came from Paris on
purpose to see Aramis."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That's true."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I will go with you
then."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do; that's the thing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Only, I ought to have seen
Aramis first, and you after.  But man proposes, and God
disposes.  I have begun with you, and will finish with
Aramis."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very well!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And in how many hours can
you go from here to Vannes?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! <i>pardieu!</i> in six
hours.  Three hours by sea to Sarzeau, three hours by road from
Sarzeau to Vannes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How convenient that is! 
Being so near to the bishopric; do you often go to Vannes?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes; once a week.  But,
stop till I get my plan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Porthos picked up his plan,
folded it carefully, and engulfed it in his large pocket.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good!" said D'Artagnan
aside; "I think I now know the real engineer who is fortifying
Belle-Isle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Two hours after, at high
tide, Porthos and D'Artagnan set out for Sarzeau.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>T</span>he passage
from Belle-Isle to Sarzeau was made rapidly enough, thanks to one
of those little corsairs of which D'Artagnan had been told during
his voyage, and which, shaped for fast sailing and destined for
the chase, were sheltered at that time in the roadstead of
Locmaria, where one of them, with a quarter of its war-crew,
performed duty between Belle-Isle and the continent.  D'Artagnan
had an opportunity of convincing himself that Porthos, though
engineer and topographer, was not deeply versed in affairs of
state.  His perfect ignorance, with any other, might have passed
for well-informed dissimulation.  But D'Artagnan knew too well
all the folds and refolds of his Porthos, not to find a secret if
there were one there; like those regular, minute old bachelors,
who know how to find, with their eyes shut, each book on the
shelves of their library and each piece of linen in their
wardrobe.  So if he had found nothing, our cunning D'Artagnan, in
rolling and unrolling his Porthos, it was because, in truth,
there was nothing to be found.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Be it so," said D'Artagnan;
"I shall get to know more at Vannes in half an hour than Porthos
has discovered at Belle-Isle in two months.  Only, in order that
I may know something, it is important that Porthos should not
make use of the only stratagem I leave at his disposal.  He must
not warn Aramis of my arrival."  All the care of the musketeer
was then, for the moment, confined to the watching of Porthos. 
And let us hasten to say, Porthos did not deserve all this
mistrust.  Porthos thought of no evil.  Perhaps, on first seeing
him, D'Artagnan had inspired him with a little suspicion; but
almost immediately D'Artagnan had reconquered in that good and
brave heart the place he had always occupied, and not the least
cloud darkened the large eye of Porthos, fixed from time to time
with tenderness on his friend.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                On landing, Porthos inquired
if his horses were waiting and soon perceived them at the
crossing of the road that winds round Sarzeau, and which, without
passing through that little city, leads towards Vannes.  These
horses were two in number, one for M. de Vallon, and one for his
equerry; for Porthos had an equerry since Mouston was only able
to use a carriage as a means of locomotion.  D'Artagnan expected
that Porthos would propose to send forward his equerry upon one
horse to bring back another, and he - D'Artagnan - had made up
his mind to oppose this proposition.  But nothing D'Artagnan had
expected happened.  Porthos simply told the equerry to dismount
and await his return at Sarzeau, whilst D'Artagnan would ride his
horse; which was arranged.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eh! but you are quite a man
of precaution, my dear Porthos," said D'Artagnan to his friend,
when he found himself in the saddle, upon the equerry's
horse.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes; but this is a kindness
on the part of Aramis.  I have not my stud here, and Aramis has
placed his stables at my disposal."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good horses for bishop's
horses, <i>mordioux!</i>" said D'Artagnan.  "It is true, Aramis
is a bishop of a peculiar kind."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He is a holy man!" replied
Porthos, in a tone almost nasal, and with his eyes raised towards
heaven.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then he is much changed,"
said D'Artagnan; "you and I have known him passably profane."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Grace has touched him,"
said Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bravo," said D'Artagnan,
"that redoubles my desire to see my dear old friend."  And he
spurred his horse, which sprang off into a more rapid pace.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Peste!</i>" said
Porthos, "if we go on at this rate, we shall only take one hour
instead of two."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To go how far, do you say,
Porthos?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Four leagues and a
half."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That will be a good
pace."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I could have embarked you
on the canal, but the devil take rowers and boat-horses!  The
first are like tortoises; the second like snails; and when a man
is able to put a good horse between his knees, that horse is
better than rowers or any other means."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are right; you above
all, Porthos, who always look magnificent on horseback."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Rather heavy, my friend; I
was weighed the other day."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And what do you weigh?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Three hundred-weight!" said
Porthos, proudly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bravo!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So that you must perceive,
I am forced to choose horses whose loins are straight and wide,
otherwise I break them down in two hours."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, giant's horses you
must have, must you not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are very polite, my
friend," replied the engineer, with affectionate majesty.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "As a case in point,"
replied D'Artagnan, "your horse seems to sweat already."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Dame!</i>  It is hot! 
Ah, ah! do you see Vannes now?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, perfectly.  It is a
handsome city, apparently."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Charming, according to
Aramis, at least; but I think it black; but black seems to be
considered handsome by artists: I am sorry for it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why so, Porthos?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Because I have lately had
my ch&acirc;teau of Pierrefonds, which was gray with age,
plastered white."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Humph!" said D'Artagnan,
"and white is more cheerful."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, but it is less august,
as Aramis tells me.  Fortunately there are dealers in black as
well as white.  I will have Pierrefonds replastered in black;
that's all there is about it.  If gray is handsome, you
understand, my friend, black must be superb."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Dame!</i>" said
D'Artagnan, "that appears logical."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Were you never at Vannes,
D'Artagnan?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Never."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then you know nothing of
the city?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Nothing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, look!" said Porthos,
raising himself in his stirrups, which made the fore-quarters of
his horse bend sadly, - "do you see that corner, in the sun,
yonder?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, I see it plainly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, that is the
cathedral."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Which is called?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Saint-Pierre.  Now look
again - in the faubourg on the left, do you see another
cross?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Perfectly well."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is Saint-Patern, the
parish preferred by Aramis."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Indeed!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Without doubt. 
Saint-Patern, you see, passes for having been the first bishop of
Vannes.  It is true that Aramis pretends he was not.  But he is
so learned that that may be only a paro - a para - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A paradox," said
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Precisely; thank you! my
tongue trips, I am so hot."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My friend," said
D'Artagnan, "continue your interesting description, I beg.  What
is that large white building with many windows?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! that is the college of
the Jesuits.  <i>Pardieu!</i> you have an apt hand.  Do you see,
close to the college, a large house with steeples, turrets, built
in a handsome Gothic style, as that fool, M. G&eacute;tard,
says?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, that is plainly to be
seen.  Well?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, that is where Aramis
resides."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What! does he not reside at
the episcopal palace?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No; that is in ruins.  The
palace likewise is in the city, and Aramis prefers the
faubourgs.  That is why, as I told you, he is partial to
Saint-Patern; Saint-Patern is in the faubourg.  Besides, there
are in this faubourg a mall, a tennis-court, and a house of
Dominicans.  Look, that where the handsome steeple rises to the
heavens."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Next, you see the faubourg
is like a separate city, it has its walls, its towers, its
ditches; the quay is upon it likewise, and the boats land at the
quay.  If our little corsair did not draw eight feet of water, we
could have come full sail up to Aramis's windows."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Porthos, Porthos," cried
D'Artagnan, "you are a well of knowledge, a spring of ingenious
and profound reflections.  Porthos, you no longer surprise me,
you confound me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Here we are," said Porthos,
turning the conversation with his usual modesty.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And high time we were,"
thought D'Artagnan, "for Aramis's horse is melting away like a
steed of ice."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                They entered almost at the
same instant the faubourg; but scarcely had they gone a hundred
paces when they were surprised to find the streets strewed with
leaves and flowers.  Against the old walls of Vannes, hung the
oldest and the strangest tapestries of France.  From over
balconies fell long white sheets stuck all over with bouquets. 
The streets were deserted; it was plain the entire population was
assembled on one point.  The blinds were closed, and the breeze
penetrated into the houses under the hangings, which cast long,
black shades between their places of issue and the walls. 
Suddenly, at the turning of a street, chants struck the ears of
the newly arrived travelers.  A crowd in holiday garb appeared
through the vapors of incense which mounted to the heavens in
blue fleeces, and clouds of rose-leaves fluttered as high as the
first stories.  Above all heads were to be seen the cross and
banners, the sacred symbols of religion.  Then, beneath these
crosses and banners, as if protected by them, walked a whole
world of young girls clothed in white, crowned with
corn-flowers.  At the two sides of the street, inclosing the
<i>cort&eacute;ge</i>, marched the guards of the garrison,
carrying bouquets in the barrels of their muskets and on the
points of their lances.  This was the procession.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Whilst D'Artagnan and
Porthos were looking on with critical glances, which disguised an
extreme impatience to get forward, a magnificent da&iuml;s
approached preceded by a hundred Jesuits and a hundred
Dominicans, and escorted by two archdeacons, a treasurer, a
penitent and twelve canons.  A singer with a thundering voice - a
man certainly picked out from all the voices of France, as was
the drum-major of the imperial guard from all the giants of the
empire - escorted by four other chanters, who appeared to be
there only to serve him as an accompaniment, made the air
resound, and the windows of the houses vibrate.  Under the
da&iuml;s appeared a pale and noble countenance with black eyes,
black hair streaked with threads of white, a delicate, compressed
mouth, a prominent and angular chin.  His head, full of graceful
majesty, was covered with the episcopal mitre, a headdress which
gave it, in addition to the character of sovereignty, that of
asceticism and evangelic meditation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Aramis!" cried the
musketeer, involuntarily, as this lofty countenance passed before
him.  The prelate started at the sound of the voice.  He raised
his large black eyes, with their long lashes, and turned them
without hesitation towards the spot whence the exclamation
proceeded.  At a glance, he saw Porthos and D'Artagnan close to
him.  On his part, D'Artagnan, thanks to the keenness of his
sight, had seen all, seized all.  The full portrait of the
prelate had entered his memory, never to leave it.  One thing had
particularly struck D'Artagnan.  On perceiving him, Aramis had
colored, then he had concentrated under his eyelids the fire of
the look of the master, and the indefinable affection of the
friend.  It was evident that Aramis had asked himself this
question: - "Why is D'Artagnan with Porthos, and what does he
want at Vannes?"  Aramis comprehended all that was passing in the
mind of D'Artagnan, on turning his look upon him again, and
seeing that he had not lowered his eyes.  He knew the acuteness
and intelligence of his friend; he feared to let him divine the
secret of his blush and his astonishment.  He was still the same
Aramis, always having a secret to conceal.  Therefore, to put an
end to his look of an inquisitor, which it was necessary to get
rid of at all events, as, at any price, a general extinguishes a
battery which annoys him, Aramis stretched forth his beautiful
white hand, upon which sparkled the amethyst of the pastoral
ring; he cut the air with sign of the cross, and poured out his
benediction upon his two friends.  Perhaps thoughtful and absent,
D'Artagnan, impious in spite of himself, might not have bent
beneath this holy benediction; but Porthos saw his distraction,
and laying his friendly hand upon the back of his companion, he
crushed him down towards the earth.  D'Artagnan was forced to
give way; indeed, he was little short of being flat on the
ground.  In the meantime Aramis had passed.  D'Artagnan, like
Ant&aelig;us, had only touched the ground, and he turned towards
Porthos, almost angry.  But there was no mistaking the intention
of the brave Hercules; it was a feeling of religious propriety
that had influenced him.  Besides, speech with Porthos, instead
of disguising his thought, always completed it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is very polite of him,"
said he, "to have given his benediction to us alone.  Decidedly,
he is a holy man, and a brave man."  Less convinced than Porthos,
D'Artagnan made no reply.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Observe my friend,"
continued Porthos, "he has seen us; and, instead of continuing to
walk on at the simple pace of the procession, as he did just now,
- see, what a hurry he is in; do you see how the
<i>cort&eacute;ge</i> is increasing its speed?  He is eager to
join us and embrace us, is that dear Aramis."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is true," replied
D'Artagnan, aloud. - Then to himself: - "It is equally true he
has seen me, the fox, and will have time to prepare himself to
receive me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                But the procession had
passed; the road was free.  D'Artagnan and Porthos walked
straight up to the episcopal palace, which was surrounded by a
numerous crowd anxious to see the prelate return.  D'Artagnan
remarked that this crowd was composed principally of citizens and
military men.  He recognized in the nature of these partisans the
address of his friend.  Aramis was not the man to seek for a
useless popularity.  He cared very little for being beloved by
people who could be of no service to him.  Women, children, and
old men, that is to say, the <i>cort&eacute;ge</i> of ordinary
pastors; was not the <i>cort&eacute;ge</i> for him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Ten minutes after the two
friends had passed the threshold of the palace, Aramis returned
like a triumphant conqueror; the soldiers presented arms to him
as to a superior; the citizens bowed to him as to a friend and a
patron, rather than as a head of the Church.  There was something
in Aramis resembling those Roman senators who had their doors
always surrounded by clients.  At the foot of the steps, he had a
conference of half a minute with a Jesuit, who, in order to speak
to him more secretly, passed his head under the da&iuml;s.  He
then re-entered his palace; the doors closed slowly, and the
crowd melted away, whilst chants and prayers were still
resounding abroad.  It was a magnificent day.  Earthly perfumes
were mingled with the perfumes of the air and the sea.  The city
breathed happiness, joy, and strength.  D'Artagnan felt something
like the presence of an invisible hand which had, all-powerfully,
created this strength, this joy, this happiness, and spread
everywhere these perfumes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! oh!" said he, "Porthos
has got fat; but Aramis is grown taller."</p>

 </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                <span style=
'font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>P</span>orthos and
D'Artagnan had entered the bishop's residence by a private door,
as his personal friends.  Of course, Porthos served D'Artagnan as
guide.  The worthy baron comported himself everywhere rather as
if he were at home.  Nevertheless, whether it was a tacit
acknowledgement of the sanctity of the personage of Aramis and
his character, or the habit of respecting him who imposed upon
him morally, a worthy habit which had always made Porthos a model
soldier and an excellent companion; for all these reasons, say
we, Porthos preserved in the palace of His Greatness the Bishop
of Vannes a sort of reserve which D'Artagnan remarked at once, in
the attitude he took with respect to the valets and officers. 
And yet this reserve did not go so far as to prevent his asking
questions.  Porthos questioned.  They learned that His Greatness
had just returned to his apartment and was preparing to appear in
familiar intimacy, less majestic than he had appeared with his
flock.  After a quarter of an hour, which D'Artagnan and Porthos
passed in looking mutually at each other with the white of their
eyes, and turning their thumbs in all the different evolutions
which go from north to south, a door of the chamber opened and
His Greatness appeared, dressed in the undress, complete, of a
prelate.  Aramis carried his head high, like a man accustomed to
command: his violet robe was tucked up on one side, and his white
hand was on his hip.  He had retained the fine mustache, and the
lengthened <i>royale</i> of the time of Louis XIII.  He exhaled,
on entering, that delicate perfume which, among elegant men and
women of high fashion, never changes, and appears to be
incorporated in the person, of whom it has become the natural
emanation.  In this case only, the perfume had retained something
of the religious sublimity of incense.  It no longer intoxicated,
it penetrated; it no longer inspired desire, it inspired
respect.  Aramis, on entering the chamber, did not hesitate an
instant; and without pronouncing one word, which, whatever it
might be, would have been cold on such an occasion, he went
straight up to the musketeer, so well disguised under the costume
of M. Agnan, and pressed him in his arms with a tenderness which
the most distrustful could not have suspected of coldness or
affectation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan, on his part,
embraced him with equal ardor.  Porthos pressed the delicate hand
of Aramis in his immense hands, and D'Artagnan remarked that His
Greatness gave him his left hand, probably from habit, seeing
that Porthos already ten times had been near injuring his fingers
covered with rings, by pounding his flesh in the vise of his
fist.  Warned by the pain, Aramis was cautious, and only
presented flesh to be bruised, and not fingers to be crushed,
against the gold or the angles of diamonds.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Between two embraces, Aramis
looked D'Artagnan in the face, offered him a chair, sitting down
himself in the shade, observing that the light fell full upon the
face of his interlocutor.  This maneuver, familiar to
diplomatists and women, resembles much the advantage of the guard
which, according to their skill or habit, combatants endeavor to
take on the ground at a duel.  D'Artagnan was not the dupe of
this maneuver; but he did not appear to perceive it.  He felt
himself caught; but, precisely because he was caught he felt
himself on the road to discovery, and it little imported to him,
old condotti&egrave;re as he was, to be beaten in appearance,
provided he drew from his pretended defeat the advantages of
victory.  Aramis began the conversation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! dear friend! my good
D'Artagnan," said he, "what an excellent chance!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is a chance, my reverend
companion," said D'Artagnan, "that I will call friendship.  I
seek you, as I always have sought you, when I had any grand
enterprise to propose to you, or some hours of liberty to give
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! indeed," said Aramis,
without explosion, "you have been seeking me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eh! yes, he has been
seeking you, Aramis," said Porthos, "and the proof is that he has
unharbored me at Belle-Isle.  That is amiable, is it not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! yes," said Aramis, "at
Belle-Isle! certainly!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good!" said D'Artagnan;
"there is my booby Porthos, without thinking of it, has fired the
first cannon of attack."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "At Belle-Isle!" said
Aramis, "in that hole, in that desert!  That is kind,
indeed!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And it was I who told him
you were at Vannes," continued Porthos, in the same tone.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan armed his mouth
with a finesse almost ironical.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, I knew, but I was
willing to see," replied he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To see what?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "If our old friendship still
held out; if, on seeing each other, our hearts, hardened as they
are by age, would still let the old cry of joy escape, which
salutes the coming of a friend."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, and you must have
been satisfied," said Aramis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So, so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How is that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, Porthos said hush! and
you - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well! and I?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you gave me your
benediction."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What would you have, my
friend?" said Aramis, smiling; "that is the most precious thing
that a poor prelate, like me, has to give."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Indeed, my dear
friend!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Doubtless."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And yet they say at Paris
that the bishopric of Vannes is one of the best in France."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! you are now speaking of
temporal wealth," said Aramis, with a careless air.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To be sure, I wish to speak
of that; I hold by it, on my part."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In that case, let me speak
of it," said Aramis, with a smile.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You own yourself to be one
of the richest prelates in France?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My friend, since you ask me
to give you an account, I will tell you that the bishopric of
Vannes is worth about twenty thousand livres a year, neither more
nor less.  It is a diocese which contains a hundred and sixty
parishes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is very pretty," said
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is superb!" said
Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And yet," resumed
D'Artagnan, throwing his eyes over Aramis, "you don't mean to
bury yourself here forever?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Pardon me.  Only I do not
admit the word <i>bury</i>."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But it seems to me, that at
this distance from Paris a man is buried, or nearly so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My friend, I am getting
old," said Aramis; "the noise and bustle of a city no longer suit
me.  At fifty-seven we ought to seek calm and meditation.  I have
found them here.  What is there more beautiful, and stern at the
same time, than this old Armorica.  I find here, dear D'Artagnan,
all that is opposite to what I formerly loved, and that is what
must happen at the end of life, which is opposite to the
beginning.  A little of my old pleasure of former times still
comes to salute me here, now and then, without diverting me from
the road of salvation.  I am still of this world, and yet every
step that I take brings me nearer to God."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eloquent, wise and
discreet; you are an accomplished prelate, Aramis, and I offer
you my congratulations."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But," said Aramis smiling,
"you did not come here only for the purpose of paying me
compliments.  Speak; what brings you hither?  May it be that, in
some fashion or other, you want me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thank God, no, my friend,"
said D'Artagnan, "it is nothing of that kind. - I am rich and
free."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Rich!" exclaimed
Aramis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, rich for me; not for
you or Porthos, understand.  I have an income of about fifteen
thousand livres."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Aramis looked at him
suspiciously.  He could not believe - particularly on seeing his
friend in such humble guise - that he had made so fine a
fortune.  Then D'Artagnan, seeing that the hour of explanations
was come, related the history of his English adventures.  During
the recital he saw, ten times, the eyes of the prelate sparkle,
and his slender fingers work convulsively.  As to Porthos, it was
not admiration he manifested for D'Artagnan; it was enthusiasm,
it was delirium.  When D'Artagnan had finished, "Well!" said
Aramis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well!" said D'Artagnan,
"you see, then, I have in England friends and property, in France
a treasure.  If your heart tells you so, I offer them to you. 
That is what I came here for."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                However firm was his look,
he could not this time support the look of Aramis.  He allowed,
therefore, his eye to stray upon Porthos - like the sword which
yields to too powerful a pressure, and seeks another road.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "At all events," said the
bishop, "you have assumed a singular traveling costume, old
friend."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Frightful!  I know it is. 
You may understand why I would not travel as a cavalier or a
noble; since I became rich, I am miserly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you say, then, you came
to Belle-Isle?" said Aramis, without transition.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes," replied D'Artagnan;
"I knew I should find you and Porthos there."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Find me!" cried Aramis. 
"Me! for the last year past I have not once crossed the sea."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh," said D'Artagnan, "I
should never have supposed you such a housekeeper."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, dear friend, I must
tell you that I am no longer the Aramis of former times.  Riding
on horseback is unpleasant to me; the sea fatigues me.  I am a
poor, ailing priest, always complaining, always grumbling, and
inclined to the austerities which appear to accord with old age,
- preliminary parleyings with death.  I linger, my dear
D'Artagnan, I linger."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, that is all the
better, my friend, for we shall probably be neighbors soon."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bah!" said Aramis with a
degree of surprise he did not even seek to dissemble.  "You my
neighbor!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Mordioux!</i> yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How so?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am about to purchase some
very profitable salt-mines, which are situated between Piriac and
Le Croisic.  Imagine, my dear friend, a clear profit of twelve
per cent.  Never any deficiency, never any idle expenses; the
ocean, faithful and regular, brings every twelve hours its
contingency to my coffers.  I am the first Parisian who has
dreamt of such a speculation.  Do not say anything about it, I
beg of you, and in a short time we will communicate on the
matter.  I am to have three leagues of country for thirty
thousand livres."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Aramis darted a look at
Porthos, as if to ask if all this were true, if some snare were
not concealed beneath this outward indifference.  But soon, as if
ashamed of having consulted this poor auxiliary, he collected all
his forces for a fresh assault and new defense.  "I heard that
you had had some difference with the court, but that you had come
out of it as you know how to get through everything, D'Artagnan,
with the honors of war."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I!" said the musketeer,
with a burst of laughter that did not conceal his embarrassment:
for, from those words, Aramis was not unlikely to be acquainted
with his last relations with the king.  "I!  Oh, tell me all
about that, pray, Aramis?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, it was related to me,
a poor bishop, lost in the middle of the <i>Landes</i>, that the
king had taken you as the confidant of his amours."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "With whom?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "With Mademoiselle de
Mancini."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan breathed freely
again.  "Ah! I don't say no to that," replied he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It appears that the king
took you one morning, over the bridge of Blois to talk with his
lady-love."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That's true," said
D'Artagnan.  "And you know that, do you?  Well, then, you must
know that the same day I gave in my resignation!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What, sincerely?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Nothing more so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It was after that, then,
that you went to the Comte de la F&egrave;re's?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Afterwards to me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And then Porthos?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Was it in order to pay us a
simple visit?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, I did no know you were
engaged, and I wished to take you with me into England."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, I understand; and then
you executed alone, wonderful man as you are, what you wanted to
propose to us all four.  I suspected you had something to do with
that famous restoration, when I learned that you had been seen at
King Charles's receptions, and that he appeared to treat you like
a friend, or rather like a person to whom he was under an
obligation."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But how the devil did you
learn all that?" asked D'Artagnan, who began to fear that the
investigation of Aramis had extended further than he wished.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Dear D'Artagnan," said the
prelate, "my friendship resembles, in a degree, the solicitude of
that night watch whom we have in the little tower of the mole, at
the extremity of the quay.  That brave man, every night, lights a
lantern to direct the barks that come from sea.  He is concealed
in his sentry-box, and the fishermen do not see him; but he
follows them with interest; he divines them; he calls them; he
attracts them into the way to the port.  I resemble this watcher;
from time to time some news reaches me, and recalls to my
remembrance all those I loved.  Then I follow the friends of old
days over the stormy ocean of the world, I, a poor watcher, to
whom God has kindly given the shelter of a sentry-box."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, what did I do when I
came from England?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! there," replied Aramis,
"you get beyond my depth.  I know nothing of you since your
return.  D'Artagnan, my eyes are dim.  I regretted you did not
think of me.  I wept over your forgetfulness.  I was wrong.  I
see you again, and it is a festival, a great festival, I assure
you, solemnly!  How is Athos?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very well, thank you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And our young pupil,
Raoul?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He seems to have inherited
the skill of his father, Athos, and the strength of his tutor,
Porthos."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And on what occasion have
you been able to judge of that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Eh! <i>mon Dieu!</i> on the
eve of my departure from Paris."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Indeed! tell me all about
it!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes; there was an execution
at the Gr&egrave;ve, and in consequence of that execution, a
riot.  <i>We</i> happened, by accident, to be in the riot; and in
this riot we were obliged to have recourse to our swords.  And he
did wonders."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bah! what did he do?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why, in the first place, he
threw a man out of the window, as he would have flung a sack full
of flock."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Come, that's pretty well,"
said Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then he drew, and cut and
thrust away, as we fellows used to do in the good old times."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And what was the cause of
this riot?" said Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan remarked upon the
face of Aramis a complete indifference to this question of
Porthos.  "Why," said he, fixing his eyes upon Aramis, "on
account of the two farmers of the revenue, friends of M. Fouquet,
whom the king forced to disgorge their plunder, and then hanged
them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                A scarcely perceptible
contraction of the prelate's brow showed that he had heard
D'Artagnan's reply.  "Oh, oh!" said Porthos; "and what were the
names of these friends of M. Fouquet?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "MM. d'Eymeris and Lyodot,"
said D'Artagnan.  "Do you know these names, Aramis?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No," said the prelate,
disdainfully; "they sound like the names of financiers."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Exactly; so they were."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!  M. Fouquet allows his
friends to be hanged, then," said Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And why not?" said
Aramis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Why, it seems to
me - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "If these culprits were
hanged, it was by order of the king.  Now M. Fouquet, although
superintendent of the finances, has not, I believe, the right of
life and death."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That may be," said Porthos;
"but in the place of M. Fouquet - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Aramis was afraid Porthos
was about to say something awkward, so interrupted him.  "Come,
D'Artagnan," said he; "this is quite enough about other people,
let us talk a little about you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Of me you know all that I
can tell you.  On the contrary let me hear a little about you,
Aramis."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have told you, my
friend.  There is nothing of Aramis left in me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Nor of the Abb&eacute;
d'Herblay even?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, not even of him.  You
see a man whom Providence has taken by the hand, whom he has
conducted to a position that he could never have dared even to
hope for."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Providence?" asked
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, that is strange!  I
was told it was M. Fouquet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who told you that?" cried
Aramis, without being able, with all the power of his will, to
prevent the color rising to his cheeks.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Ma foi!</i> why,
Bazin!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The fool!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I do not say he is a man of
genius, it is true; but he told me so; and after him, I repeat it
to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have never even seen M.
Fouquet," replied Aramis with a look as pure and calm as that of
a virgin who has never told a lie.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, but if you had seen
him and known him, there is no harm in that," replied
D'Artagnan.  "M. Fouquet is a very good sort of a man."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Humph!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A great politician." 
Aramis made a gesture of indifference.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "An all-powerful
minister."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I only hold to the king and
the pope."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Dame!</i> listen then,"
said D'Artagnan, in the most natural tone imaginable.  "I said
that because everybody here swears by M. Fouquet.  The plain is
M. Fouquet's; the salt-mines I am about to buy are M. Fouquet's;
the island in which Porthos studies topography is M. Fouquet's;
the garrison is M. Fouquet's; the galleys are M. Fouquet's.  I
confess, then, that nothing would have surprised me in your
enfeoffment, or rather in that of your diocese, to M. Fouquet. 
He is a different master from the king, that is all; but quite as
powerful as Louis."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thank God!  I am not vassal
to anybody; I belong to nobody, and am entirely my own master,"
replied Aramis, who, during this conversation, followed with his
eye every gesture of D'Artagnan, every glance of Porthos.  But
D'Artagnan was impassible and Porthos motionless; the thrusts
aimed so skillfully were parried by an able adversary; not one
hit the mark.  Nevertheless, both began to feel the fatigue of
such a contest, and the announcement of supper was well received
by everybody.  Supper changed the course of conversation. 
Besides, they felt that, upon their guard as each one had been,
they could neither of them boast of having the advantage. 
Porthos had understood nothing of what had been meant.  He had
held himself motionless, because Aramis had made him a sign not
to stir.  Supper, for him, was nothing but supper; but that was
quite enough for Porthos.  The supper, then, went off very well. 
D'Artagnan was in high spirits.  Aramis exceeded himself in kind
affability.  Porthos ate like old Pelops.  Their talk was of war,
finance, the arts, and love.  Aramis played astonishment at every
word of politics D'Artagnan risked.  This long series of
surprises increased the mistrust of D'Artagnan, as the eternal
indifference of D'Artagnan provoked the suspicions of Aramis.  At
length D'Artagnan, designedly, uttered the name of Colbert: he
had reserved that stroke for the last.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who is this Colbert?" asked
the bishop.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! come," said D'Artagnan
to himself, "that is too strong!  We must be careful,
<i>mordioux!</i> we must be careful."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                And he then gave Aramis all
the information respecting M. Colbert he could desire.  The
supper, or rather, the conversation, was prolonged till one
o'clock in the morning between D'Artagnan and Aramis.  At ten
o'clock precisely, Porthos had fallen asleep in his chair and
snored like an organ.  At midnight he woke up and they sent him
to bed.  "Hum!" said he, "I was near falling asleep; but that was
all very interesting you were talking about."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                At one o'clock Aramis
conducted D'Artagnan to the chamber destined for him, which was
the best in the episcopal residence.  Two servants were placed at
his command.  "To-morrow, at eight o'clock," said he, taking
leave of D'Artagnan, "we will take, if agreeable to you, a ride
on horseback with Porthos."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "At eight o'clock!" said
D'Artagnan; "so late?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You know that I require
seven hours' sleep," said Aramis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is true."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good-night, dear friend!" 
And he embraced the musketeer cordially.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan allowed him to
depart; then, as soon as the door closed, "Good!" cried he, "at
five o'clock I will be on foot."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                This determination being
made, he went to bed and quietly, "put two and two together," as
people say.</p>

D'Artagnan extinguished his taper, when Aramis, who had watched
through his curtains the last glimmer of light in his friend's
apartment, traversed the corridor on tiptoe, and went to
Porthos's room.  The giant who had been in bed nearly an hour and
a half, lay grandly stretched out on the down bed.  He was in
that happy calm of the first sleep, which, with Porthos, resisted
the noise of bells or the report of cannon: his head swam in that
soft oscillation which reminds us of the soothing movement of a
ship.  In a moment Porthos would have begun to dream.  The door
of the chamber opened softly under the delicate pressure of the
hand of Aramis.  The bishop approached the sleeper.  A thick
carpet deadened his steps, besides which Porthos snored in a
manner to drown all noise.  He laid one hand on his shoulder -
"Rouse," said he, "wake up, my dear Porthos."  The voice of
Aramis was soft and kind, but it conveyed more than a notice, -
it conveyed an order.  His hand was light, but it indicated
danger.  Porthos heard the voice and felt the hand of Aramis,
even in the depth of sleep.  He started up.  "Who goes there?"
cried he, in his giant's voice.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Hush! hush!  It is I," said
Aramis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You, my friend?  And what
the devil do you wake me for?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To tell you that you must
set off directly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Set off?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Where for?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "For Paris."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Porthos bounded up in his
bed, and then sank back down again, fixing his great eyes in
agitation upon Aramis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "For Paris?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A hundred leagues?" said
he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A hundred and four,"
replied the bishop.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! <i>mon Dieu!</i>"
sighed Porthos, lying down again, like children who contend with
their <i>bonne</i> to gain an hour or two more sleep.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thirty hours' riding," said
Aramis, firmly.  "You know there are good relays."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Porthos pushed out one leg,
allowing a groan to escape him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Come, come! my friend,"
insisted the prelate with a sort of impatience.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Porthos drew the other leg
out of the bed.  "And is it absolutely necessary that I should
go, at once?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Urgently necessary."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Porthos got upon his feet,
and began to shake both walls and floors with his steps of a
marble statue.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Hush! hush! for the love of
Heaven, my dear Porthos!" said Aramis, "you will wake
somebody."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! that's true," replied
Porthos, in a voice of thunder, "I forgot that; but be satisfied,
I am on guard."  And so saying, he let fall a belt loaded with
his sword and pistols, and a purse, from which the crowns escaped
with a vibrating and prolonged noise.  This noise made the blood
of Aramis boil, whilst it drew from Porthos a formidable burst of
laughter.  "How droll that is!" said he, in the same voice.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Not so loud, Porthos, not
so loud."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "True, true!" and he lowered
his voice a half-note.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I was going to say,"
continued Porthos, "that it is droll that we are never so slow as
when we are in a hurry, and never make so much noise as when we
wish to be silent."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, that is true; but let
us give the proverb the lie, Porthos; let us make haste, and hold
our tongue."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You see I am doing my
best," said Porthos, putting on his <i>haut de chausses</i>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very well."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This is something in
haste?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is more than that, it is
serious, Porthos."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, oh!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "D'Artagnan has questioned
you, has he not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Questioned me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, at Belle-Isle?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Not the least in the
world."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Are you sure of that,
Porthos?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Parbleu!</i>"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is impossible. 
Recollect yourself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He asked me what I was
doing, and I told him - studying topography.  I would have made
use of another word which you employed one day."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "'Castrametation'?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, that's it; but I never
could recollect it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "All the better.  What more
did he ask you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who M. G&eacute;tard
was."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Next?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who M. Jupenet was."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He did not happen to see
our plan of fortifications, did he?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The devil he did!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But don't be alarmed, I had
rubbed out your writing with India-rubber.  It was impossible for
him to suppose you had given me any advice in those works."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ay; but our friend has
phenomenally keen eyes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What are you afraid
of?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I fear that everything is
discovered, Porthos; the matter is, then, to prevent a great
misfortune.  I have given orders to my people to close all the
gates and doors.  D'Artagnan will not be able to get out before
daybreak.  Your horse is ready saddled; you will gain the first
relay; by five o'clock in the morning you will have traversed
fifteen leagues.  Come!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Aramis then assisted Porthos
to dress, piece by piece, with as much celerity as the most
skillful <i>valet de chambre</i> could have done.  Porthos, half
stupefied, let him do as he liked, and confounded himself in
excuses.  When he was ready, Aramis took him by the hand, and led
him, making him place his foot with precaution on every step of
the stairs, preventing him running against door-frames, turning
him this way and that, as if Aramis had been the giant and
Porthos the dwarf.  Soul set fire to and animated matter.  A
horse was waiting, ready saddled, in the courtyard.  Porthos
mounted.  Then Aramis himself took the horse by the bridle, and
led him over some dung spread in the yard, with the evident
intention of suppressing noise.  He, at the same time, held tight
the horse's nose, to prevent him neighing.  When arrived at the
outward gate, drawing Porthos towards him, who was going off
without even asking him what for: "Now, friend Porthos, now;
without drawing bridle, till you get to Paris," whispered he in
his ears; "eat on horseback, drink on horseback, but lose not a
minute."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That's enough; I will not
stop."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This letter to M. Fouquet;
cost what it may, he must have it to-morrow before mid-day."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He shall."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And do not forget
<i>one</i> thing, my friend."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What is that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That you are riding out on
a hunt for your <i>brevet</i> of <i>duc</i> and peer."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! oh!" said Porthos, with
his eyes sparkling; "I will do it in twenty-four hours, in that
case."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Try."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then let go the bridle -
and forward, Goliath!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Aramis did let go, not the
bridle, but the horse's nose.  Porthos released his hand, clapped
spurs to his horse, which set off at a gallop.  As long as he
could distinguish Porthos through the darkness, Aramis followed
him with his eyes: when he was completely out of sight, he
re-entered the yard.  Nothing had stirred in D'Artagnan's
apartment.  The <i>valet</i> placed on watch at the door had
neither seen any light, nor heard any noise.  Aramis closed his
door carefully, sent the lackey to bed, and quickly sought his
own.  D'Artagnan really suspected nothing, therefore thought he
had gained everything, when he awoke in the morning, about
half-past four.  He ran to the window in his shirt.  The window
looked out upon the court.  Day was dawning.  The court was
deserted; the fowls, even, had not left their roosts.  Not a
servant appeared.  Every door was closed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good! all is still," said
D'Artagnan to himself.  "Never mind: I am up first in the house. 
Let us dress; that will be so much done."  And D'Artagnan dressed
himself.  But, this time, he endeavored not to give to the
costume of M. Agnan that <i>bourgeoise</i> and almost
ecclesiastical rigidity he had affected before; he managed, by
drawing his belt tighter, by buttoning his clothes in a different
fashion, and by putting on his hat a little on one side, to
restore to his person a little of that military character, the
absence of which had surprised Aramis.  This being done, he made
free, or affected to make free with his host, and entered his
chamber without ceremony.  Aramis was asleep or feigned to be
so.  A large book lay open upon his night-desk, a wax-light was
still burning in its silver sconce.  This was more than enough to
prove to D'Artagnan the quiescence of the prelate's night, and
the good intentions of his waking.  The musketeer did to the
bishop precisely as the bishop had done to Porthos - he tapped
him on the shoulder.  Evidently Aramis pretended to sleep; for,
instead of waking suddenly, he who slept so lightly required a
repetition of the summons.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! ah! is that you?" said
he, stretching his arms.  "What an agreeable surprise!  <i>Ma
foi!</i>  Sleep had made me forget I had the happiness to possess
you.  What o'clock is it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I do not know," said
D'Artagnan, a little embarrassed.  "Early, I believe.  But, you
know, that devil of a habit of waking with the day, sticks to me
still."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do you wish that we should
go out so soon?" asked Aramis.  "It appears to me to be very
early."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Just as you like."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I thought we had agreed not
to get on horseback before eight."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Possibly; but I had so
great a wish to see you, that I said to myself, the sooner the
better."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And my seven hours' sleep!"
said Aramis: "Take care; I had reckoned upon them, and what I
lose of them I must make up."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But it seems to me that,
formerly, you were less of a sleeper than that, dear friend; your
blood was alive, and you were never to be found in bed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And it is exactly on
account of what you tell me, that I am so fond of being there
now."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then you confess, that it
is not for the sake of sleeping, that you have put me off till
eight o'clock."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have been afraid you
would laugh at me, if I told you the truth."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Tell me,
notwithstanding."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, from six to eight, I
am accustomed to perform my devotions."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your devotions?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I did not believe a
bishop's exercises were so severe."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A bishop, my friend, must
sacrifice more to appearance than a simple cleric."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Mordioux!</i>  Aramis,
that is a word which reconciles me with your greatness.  To
appearances!  That is a musketeer's word, in good truth! 
<i>Vivent les apparences</i>, Aramis!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Instead of felicitating me
upon it, pardon me, D'Artagnan.  It is a very mundane word which
I had allowed to escape me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Must I leave you,
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I want time to collect my
thoughts, my friend, and for my usual prayers."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, I leave you to them;
but on account of that poor pagan, D'Artagnan, abridge them for
once, I beg; I thirst for speech with you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, D'Artagnan, I promise
you that within an hour and a half - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "An hour and a half of
devotions!  Ah! my friend, be as reasonable with me as you can. 
Let me have the best bargain possible."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Aramis began to laugh.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Still agreeable, still
young, still gay," said he.  "You have come into my diocese to
set me quarreling with grace."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bah!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you know well that I
was never able to resist your seductions; you will cost me my
salvation, D'Artagnan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan bit his lips.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well," said he, "I will
take the sin on my own head, favor me with one simple Christian
sign of the cross, favor me with one prayer, and we will
part."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Hush!" said Aramis, "we are
already no longer alone, I hear strangers coming up."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, dismiss them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Impossible; I made an
appointment with them yesterday; it is the principal of the
college of the Jesuits, and the superior of the Dominicans."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your staff?  Well, so be
it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What are you going to
do?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I will go and wake Porthos,
and remain in his company till you have finished the
conference."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Aramis did not stir, his
brow remained unbent, he betrayed himself by no gesture or word;
"Go," said he, as D'Artagnan advanced to the door.  "<i>A
propos</i>, do you know where Porthos sleeps?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, but I will
inquire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Take the corridor, and open
the second door on the left."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thank you! <i>au
revoir</i>."  And D'Artagnan departed in the direction pointed
out by Aramis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Ten minutes had not passed
away when he came back.  He found Aramis seated between the
superior of the Dominicans and the principal of the college of
the Jesuits, exactly in the same situation as he had found him
formerly in the auberge at Cr&egrave;vec&oelig;ur.  This company
did not at all terrify the musketeer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What is it?" said Aramis,
quietly.  "You have apparently something to say to me, my
friend."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is," replied D'Artagnan,
fixing his eyes upon Aramis, "it is that Porthos is not in his
apartment."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Indeed," said Aramis
calmly; "are you sure?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Pardieu!</i>  I came
from his chamber."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Where can he be, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is what I am asking
<i>you</i>."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And have you not
inquired?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, I have."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And what answer did you
get?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That Porthos, often walking
out in a morning, without saying anything, had probably gone
out."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What did you do, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I went to the stables,"
replied D'Artagnan, carelessly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What to do?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To see if Porthos had
departed on horseback."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And?" interrogated the
bishop.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, there is a horse
missing, stall No. 3, Goliath."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                All this dialogue, it may be
easily understood, was not exempt from a certain affectation on
the part of the musketeer, and a perfect complaisance on the part
of Aramis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!  I guess how it is,"
said Aramis, after having considered for a moment, "Porthos is
gone out to give us a surprise."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A surprise?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes; the canal which goes
from Vannes to the sea abounds in teal and snipes; that is
Porthos's favorite sport, and he will bring us back a dozen for
breakfast."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do you think so?" said
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am sure of it.  Where
else can he be?  I would lay a wager he took a gun with him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, that is possible,"
said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do one thing, my friend. 
Get on horseback, and join him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are right," said
D'Artagnan, "I will."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Shall I go with you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, thank you; Porthos is a
rather remarkable man: I will inquire as I go along."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Will you take an
arquebus?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thank  you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Order what horse you like
to be saddled."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The one I rode yesterday,
on coming from Belle-Isle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So be it: use the horse as
your own."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Aramis rang, and gave orders
to have the horse M. d'Artagnan had chosen saddled.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan followed the
servant charged with the execution of this order.  When arrived
at the door, the servant drew on one side to allow M. d'Artagnan
to pass; and at that moment he caught the eye of his master.  A
knitting of the brow gave the intelligent spy to understand that
all should be given to D'Artagnan he wished.  D'Artagnan got into
the saddle, and Aramis heard the steps of his horse on the
pavement.  An instant after, the servant returned.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well?" asked the
bishop.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monseigneur, he has
followed the course of the canal, and is going towards the sea,"
said the servant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very well!" said
Aramis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                In fact, D'Artagnan,
dismissing all suspicion, hastened towards the ocean, constantly
hoping to see in the <i>Landes</i>, or on the beach, the colossal
profile of Porthos.  He persisted in fancying he could trace a
horse's steps in every puddle.  Sometimes he imagined he heard
the report of a gun.  This illusion lasted three hours; during
two of which he went forward in search of his friend - in the
last he returned to the house.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "We must have crossed," said
he, "and I shall find them waiting for me at table."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                D'Artagnan was mistaken.  He
no more found Porthos at the palace than he had found him on the
sea-shore.  Aramis was waiting for him at the top of the stairs,
looking very much concerned.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Did my people not find you,
my dear D'Artagnan?" cried he, as soon as he caught sight of the
musketeer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No; did you send any one
after me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am deeply concerned, my
friend, deeply, to have induced you to make such a useless
search; but, about seven o'clock, the almoner of Saint-Patern
came here.  He had met Du Vallon, who was going away, and who,
being unwilling to disturb anybody at the palace, had charged him
to tell me that, fearing M. G&eacute;tard would play him some ill
turn in his absence, he was going to take advantage of the
morning tide to make a tour of Belle-Isle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But tell me, Goliath has
not crossed the four leagues of sea, I should think."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "There are full six," said
Aramis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That makes it less probable
still."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Therefore, my friend," said
Aramis, with one of his blandest smiles, "Goliath is in the
stable, well pleased, I will answer for it, that Porthos is no
longer on his back."  In fact, the horse had been brought back
from the relay by the direction of the prelate, from whom no
detail escaped.  D'Artagnan appeared as well satisfied with as
possible with the explanation.  He entered upon a part of
dissimulation which agreed perfectly with the suspicions that
arose more strongly in his mind.  He breakfasted between the
Jesuit and Aramis, having the Dominican in front of him, and
smiling particularly at the Dominican, whose jolly, fat face
pleased him much.  The repast was long and sumptuous; excellent
Spanish wine, fine Morbihan oysters, exquisite fish from the
mouth of the Loire, enormous prawns from Paimb&oelig;uf, and
delicious game from the moors, constituted the principal part of
it.  D'Artagnan ate much, and drank but little.  Aramis drank
nothing, unless it was water.  After the repast, -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You offered me an
arquebus," said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I did."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Lend it me, then."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Are you going
shooting?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Whilst waiting for Porthos,
it is the best thing I can do, I think."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Take which you like from
the trophy."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Will you not come with
me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I would with great
pleasure; but, alas! my friend, sporting is forbidden to
bishops."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah!" said D'Artagnan, "I
did not know that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Besides," continued Aramis,
"I shall be busy till mid-day."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I shall go alone, then?"
said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am sorry to say you must;
but come back to dinner."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Pardieu!</i> the eating
at your house is too good to make me think of not coming back." 
And thereupon D'Artagnan quitted his host, bowed to the guests,
and took his arquebus; but instead of shooting, went straight to
the little port of Vannes.  He looked in vain to observe if
anybody saw him; he could discern neither thing nor person.  He
engaged a little fishing boat for twenty-five livres, and set off
at half-past eleven, convinced that he had not been followed; and
that was true, he had not been followed; only a Jesuit brother,
placed in the top of the steeple of his church, had not, since
the morning, by the help of an excellent glass, lost sight of one
of his steps.  At three quarters past eleven, Aramis was informed
that D'Artagnan was sailing towards Belle-Isle.  The voyage was
rapid; a good north north-east wind drove him towards the isle. 
As he approached, his eyes were constantly fixed upon the coast. 
He looked to see if, upon the shore or upon the fortifications
the brilliant dress and vast stature of Porthos should stand out
against a slightly clouded sky; but his search was in vain.  He
landed without having seen anything; and learnt from the first
soldier interrogated by him, that M. du Vallon had not yet
returned from Vannes.  Then, without losing an instant,
D'Artagnan ordered his little bark to put its head towards
Sarzeau.  We know that the wind changes with the different hours
of the day.  The breeze had veered from the north north-east to
the south-east; the wind, then, was almost as good for the return
to Sarzeau, as it had been for the voyage to Belle-Isle.  In
three hours D'Artagnan had touched the continent; two hours more
sufficed for his ride to Vannes.  In spite of the rapidity of his
passage, what D'Artagnan endured of impatience and anger during
that short passage, the deck alone of the vessel, upon which he
stamped backwards and forwards for three hours, could testify. 
He made but one bound from the quay whereon he landed to the
episcopal palace.  He thought to terrify Aramis by the
promptitude of his return; he wished to reproach him with his
duplicity, and yet with reserve; but with sufficient spirit,
nevertheless, to make him feel all the consequences of it, and
force from him a part of his secret.  He hoped, in short - thanks
to that heat of expression which is to <i>secrets</i> what the
charge with the bayonet is to redoubts - to bring the mysterious
Aramis to some manifestation or other.  But he found, in the
vestibule of the palace, the <i>valet de chambre</i>, who closed
his passage, while smiling upon him with a stupid air.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monseigneur?" cried
D'Artagnan, endeavoring to put him aside with his hand.  Moved
for an instant the valet resumed his station.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monseigneur?" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, to be sure; do you not
know me, <i>imb&eacute;cile?</i>"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes; you are the Chevalier
d'Artagnan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then let me pass."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is of no use."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why of no use?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Because His Greatness is
not at home."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What!  His Greatness is not
at home? where is he, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Gone."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Gone?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Whither?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I don't know; but perhaps
he tells monsieur le chevalier."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And how? where? in what
fashion?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "In this letter, which he
gave me for monsieur le chevalier."  And the <i>valet de
chambre</i> drew a letter form his pocket."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Give it me, then, you
rascal," said D'Artagnan, snatching it from his hand.  "Oh, yes,"
continued he, at the first line, "yes, I understand;" and he
read: -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">               </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Dear Friend, - An affair of
the most urgent nature calls me to a distant parish of my
diocese.  I hoped to see you again before I set out; but I lose
that hope in thinking that you are going, no doubt, to remain two
or three days at Belle-Isle, with our dear Porthos.  Amuse
yourself as well as you can; but do not attempt to hold out
against him at table.  This is a counsel I might have given even
to Athos, in his most brilliant and best days.  Adieu, dear
friend; believe that I regret greatly not having better, and for
a longer time, profited by your excellent company."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Mordioux!</i>" cried
D'Artagnan.  "I am tricked.  Ah! blockhead, brute, triple fool
that I am!  But those laugh best who laugh last.  Oh, duped,
duped like a monkey, cheated with an empty nutshell!"  And with a
hearty blow bestowed upon the nose of the smirking <i>valet de
chambre</i>, he made all haste out of the episcopal palace. 
Furet, however good a trotter, was not equal to present
circumstances.  D'Artagnan therefore took the post, and chose a
horse which he soon caused to demonstrate, with good spurs and a
light hand, that deer are not the swiftest animals in nature.</p>

thirty-five hours after the events we have just related, as M.
Fouquet, according to his custom, having interdicted his door,
was working in the cabinet of his house at Saint-Mand&eacute;,
with which we are already acquainted, a carriage, drawn by four
horses steaming with sweat, entered the court at full gallop. 
This carriage was, probably, expected; for three or four lackeys
hastened to the door, which they opened.  Whilst M. Fouquet rose
from his bureau and ran to the window, a man got painfully out of
the carriage, descending with difficulty the three steps of the
door, leaning upon the shoulders of the lackeys.  He had scarcely
uttered his name, when the <i>valet</i> upon whom he was not
leaning, sprang up to the <i>perron</i>, and disappeared in the
vestibule.  This man went to inform his master; but he had no
occasion to knock at the door: Fouquet was standing on the
threshold.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monseigneur, the Bishop of
Vannes," said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Very well!" replied his
master.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Then, leaning over the
banister of the staircase, of which Aramis was beginning to
ascend the first steps, -</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, dear friend!" said he,
"you, so soon!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes; I, myself, monsieur!
but bruised, battered, as you see."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! my poor friend," said
Fouquet, presenting him his arm, on which Aramis leant, whilst
the servants drew back respectfully.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Bah!" replied Aramis, "it
is nothing, since I am here; the principal thing was that I
should <i>get</i> here, and here I am."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Speak quickly," said
Fouquet, closing the door of the cabinet behind Aramis and
himself.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Are we alone?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, perfectly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No one observes us? - no
one can hear us?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Be satisfied; nobody."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is M. du Vallon
arrived?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you have received my
letter?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes.  The affair is
serious, apparently, since it necessitates your attendance in
Paris, at a moment when your presence was so urgent
elsewhere."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are right, it could not
be more serious."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Thank you! thank you!  What
is it about?  But, for God's sake! before anything else, take
time to breathe, dear friend.  You are so pale, you frighten
me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am really in great pain. 
But, for Heaven's sake, think nothing about me.  Did M. du Vallon
tell you nothing, when he delivered the letter to you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No; I heard a great noise;
I went to the window; I saw at the foot of the <i>perron</i> a
sort of horseman of marble; I went down, he held the letter out
to me, and his horse fell down dead."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But he?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He fell with the horse; he
was lifted, and carried to an apartment.  Having read the letter,
I went up to him, in hopes of obtaining more ample information;
but he was asleep, and, after such a fashion, that it was
impossible to wake him.  I took pity on him; I gave orders that
his boots should be cut from off his legs, and that he should be
left quite undisturbed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "So far well; now, this is
the question in hand, monseigneur.  You have seen M. d'Artagnan
in Paris, have you not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "<i>Certes</i>, and think
him a man of intelligence, and even a man of heart; although he
did bring about the death of our dear friends, Lyodot and
D'Eymeris."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Alas! yes, I heard of
that.  At Tours I met the courier who was bringing the letter
from Gourville, and the dispatches from P&eacute;lisson.  Have
you seriously reflected on that event, monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And in it you perceived a
direct attack upon your sovereignty?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And do you believe it to be
so?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, yes, I think so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, I must confess, that
sad idea occurred to me likewise."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Do not blind yourself,
monsieur, in the name of Heaven!  Listen attentively to me, - I
return to D'Artagnan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am all attention."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Under what circumstances
did you see him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He came here for
money."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "With what kind of
order?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "With an order from the
king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Direct?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Signed by his majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "There, then!  Well,
D'Artagnan has been to Belle-Isle; he was disguised; he came in
the character of some sort of an <i>intendant</i>, charged by his
master to purchase salt-mines.  Now, D'Artagnan has no other
master but the king: he came, then, sent by the king.  He saw
Porthos."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who is Porthos?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I beg your pardon, I made a
mistake.  He saw M. du Vallon at Belle-Isle; and he knows, as
well as you and I do, that Belle-Isle is fortified."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you think that the king
sent him there?" said Fouquet, pensively.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I certainly do."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And D'Artagnan, in the
hands of the king, is a dangerous instrument?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The most dangerous
imaginable."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then I formed a correct
opinion of him at the first glance."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How so?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I wished to attach him to
myself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "If you judged him to be the
bravest, the most acute, and the most adroit man in France, you
judged correctly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He must be had then, at any
price."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "D'Artagnan?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Is that not your
opinion?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It may be my opinion, but
you will never get him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Why?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Because we have allowed the
time to go by.  He was dissatisfied with the court, we should
have profited by that; since that, he has passed into England;
there he powerfully assisted in the restoration, there he gained
a fortune, and, after all, he returned to the service of the
king.  Well, if he has returned to the service of the king, it is
because he is well paid in that service."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "We will pay him even
better, that is all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! monsieur, excuse me;
D'Artagnan has a high respect for his word, and where that is
once engaged he keeps it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What do you conclude,
then?" said Fouquet, with great inquietude.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "At present, the principal
thing is to parry a dangerous blow."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And how is it to be
parried?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Listen."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But D'Artagnan will come
and render an account to the king of his mission."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, we have time enough to
think about that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How so?  You are much in
advance of him, I presume?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Nearly ten hours."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, in ten hours - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Aramis shook his pale head. 
"Look at these clouds which flit across the heavens; at these
swallows which cut the air.  D'Artagnan moves more quickly than
the clouds or the birds; D'Artagnan is the wind which carries
them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A strange man!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I tell you, he is
superhuman, monsieur.  He is of my own age, and I have known him
these five-and-thirty years."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, listen to my
calculation, monsieur.  I send M. du Vallon off to you two hours
after midnight.  M. du Vallon was eight hours in advance of me;
when did M. du Vallon arrive?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "About four hours ago."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You see, then, that I
gained four upon him; and yet Porthos is a staunch horseman, and
he has left on the road eight dead horses, whose bodies I came to
successively.  I rode post fifty leagues; but I have the gout,
the gravel, and what else I know not; so that fatigue kills me. 
I was obliged to dismount at Tours; since that, rolling along in
a carriage, half dead, sometimes overturned, drawn upon the
sides, and sometimes on the back of the carriage, always with
four spirited horses at full gallop, I have arrived &ndash;
arrived, gaining four hours upon Porthos; but, see you,
D'Artagnan does not weigh three hundred-weight, as Porthos does;
D'Artagnan has not the gout and gravel, as I have; he is not a
horseman, he is a centaur.  D'Artagnan, look you, set out for
Belle-Isle when I set out for Paris; and D'Artagnan,
notwithstanding my ten hours' advance, D'Artagnan will arrive
within two hours after me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But, then, accidents?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He never meets with
accidents."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Horses may fail him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He will run as fast as a
horse."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Good God! what a man!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, he is a man whom I
love and admire.  I love him because he is good, great, and
loyal; I admire him because he represents in my eyes the
culminating point of human power; but, whilst loving and admiring
him, I fear him, and am on my guard against him.  Now then, I
resume, monsieur; in two hours D'Artagnan will be here; be
beforehand with him.  Go to the Louvre, and see the king, before
he sees D'Artagnan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What shall I say to the
king?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Nothing; give him
Belle-Isle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh!  Monsieur d'Herblay! 
Monsieur d'Herblay," cried Fouquet, "what projects crushed all at
once!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "After one project that has
failed, there is always another project that may lead to fortune;
we should never despair.  Go, monsieur, and go at once."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But that garrison, so
carefully chosen, the king will change it directly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That garrison, monsieur,
was the king's when it entered Belle-Isle; it is yours now; it is
the same with all garrisons after a fortnight's occupation.  Let
things go on, monsieur.  Do you see any inconvenience in having
an army at the end of a year, instead of two regiments?  Do you
not see that your garrison of to-day will make you partisans at
La Rochelle, Nantes, Bordeaux, Toulouse - in short, wherever they
may be sent to?  Go to the king, monsieur; go; time flies, and
D'Artagnan, while we are losing time, is flying, like an arrow,
along the high-road."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur d'Herblay, you
know that each word from you is a germ which fructifies in my
thoughts.  I will go to the Louvre."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Instantly, will you
not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I only ask time to change
my dress."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Remember that D'Artagnan
has no need to pass through Saint-Mand&eacute;; but will go
straight to the Louvre; that is cutting off an hour from the
advantage that yet remains to us."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "D'Artagnan may have
everything except my English horses.  I shall be at the Louvre in
twenty-five minutes."  And, without losing a second, Fouquet gave
orders for his departure.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Aramis had only time to say
to him, "Return as quickly as you go; for I shall await you
impatiently."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Five minutes after, the
superintendent was flying along the road to Paris.  During this
time, Aramis desired to be shown the chamber in which Porthos was
sleeping.  At the door of Fouquet's cabinet he was folded in the
arms of P&eacute;lisson, who had just heard of his arrival, and
had left his office to see him.  Aramis received, with that
friendly dignity which he knew so well how to assume, these
caresses, respectful as earnest; but all at once stopping on the
landing-place, "What is that I hear up yonder?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                There was, in fact, a
hoarse, growling kind of noise, like the roar of a hungry tiger,
or an impatient lion.  "Oh, that is nothing," said
P&eacute;lisson, smiling.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well; but - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is M. du Vallon
snoring."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah! true," said Aramis: "I
had forgotten.  No one but he is capable of making such a noise. 
Allow me, P&eacute;lisson, to inquire if he wants anything."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you will permit me to
accompany you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, certainly;" and both
entered the chamber.  Porthos was stretched upon the bed; his
face was violet rather than red; his eyes were swelled; his mouth
was wide open.  The roaring which escaped from the deep cavities
of his chest made the glass of the windows vibrate.  To those
developed and clearly defined muscles starting from his face, to
his hair matted with sweat, to the energetic heaving of his chin
and shoulders, it was impossible to refuse a certain degree of
admiration.  Strength carried to this point is semi-divine.  The
Herculean legs and feet of Porthos had, by swelling, burst his
stockings; all the strength of his huge body was converted into
the rigidity of stone.  Porthos moved no more than does the giant
of granite which reclines upon the plains of Agrigentum. 
According to P&eacute;lisson's orders, his boots had been cut
off, for no human power could have pulled them off.  Four lackeys
had tried in vain, pulling at them as they would have pulled
capstans; and yet all this did not awaken him.  They had hacked
off his boots in fragments, and his legs had fallen back upon the
bed.  They then cut off the rest of his clothes, carried him to a
bath, in which they let him soak a considerable time.  They then
put on him clean linen, and placed him in a well-warmed bed - the
whole with efforts and pains which might have roused a dead man,
but which did not make Porthos open an eye, or interrupt for a
second the formidable diapason of his snoring.  Aramis wished on
his part, with his nervous nature, armed with extraordinary
courage, to outbrave fatigue, and employ himself with Gourville
and P&eacute;lisson, but he fainted in the chair in which he had
persisted sitting.  He was carried into the adjoining room, where
the repose of bed soon soothed his failing brain.</p>

meantime Fouquet was hastening to the Louvre, at the best speed
of his English horses.  The king was at work with Colbert.  All
at once the king became thoughtful.  The two sentences of death
he had signed on mounting his throne sometimes recurred to his
memory; they were two black spots which he saw with his eyes
open; two spots of blood which he saw when his eyes were closed. 
"Monsieur," said he rather sharply, to the intendant; "it
sometimes seems to me that those two men you made me condemn were
not very great culprits."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, they were picked out
from the herd of the farmers of the financiers, which wanted
decimating."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Picked out by whom?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "By necessity, sire,"
replied Colbert, coldly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Necessity! - a great word,"
murmured the young king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A great goddess, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "They were devoted friends
of the superintendent, were they not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire; friends who
would have given up their lives for Monsieur Fouquet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "They have given them,
monsieur," said the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is true; - but
uselessly, by good luck, - which was not their intention."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How much money had these
men fraudulently obtained?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ten millions, perhaps; of
which six have been confiscated."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And is that money in my
coffers?" said the king with a certain air of repugnance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is there, sire; but this
confiscation, whilst threatening M. Fouquet, has not touched
him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You conclude, then, M.
Colbert - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That if M. Fouquet has
raised against your majesty a troop of factious rioters to
extricate his friends from punishment, he will raise an army when
he has in turn to extricate <i>himself</i> from punishment."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king darted at his
confidant one of those looks which resemble the livid fire of a
flash of lightning, one of those looks which illuminate the
darkness of the basest consciences.  "I am astonished," said he,
"that, thinking such things of M. Fouquet, you did not come to
give me your counsels thereupon."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Counsels upon what,
sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Tell me, in the first
place, clearly and precisely, what you think, M. Colbert."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Upon what subject,
sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Upon the conduct of M.
Fouquet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I think, sire, that M.
Fouquet, not satisfied with attracting all the money to himself,
as M. Mazarin did, and by that means depriving your majesty of
one part of your power, still wishes to attract to himself all
the friends of easy life and pleasure - of what idlers call
poetry, and politicians, corruption.  I think that, by holding
the subjects of your majesty in pay, he trespasses upon the royal
prerogative, and cannot, if this continues so, be long in placing
your majesty among the weak and the obscure."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How would you qualify all
these projects, M. Colbert?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The projects of M. Fouquet,
sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "They are called crimes of
<i>l&egrave;se majest&eacute;.</i>"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And what is done to
criminals guilty of <i>l&egrave;se majest&eacute;?</i>"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "They are arrested, tried,
and punished."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are quite certain that
M. Fouquet has conceived the idea of the crime you impute to
him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I can say more, sire; there
is even a commencement of the execution of it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, then, I return to
that which I was saying, M. Colbert."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And you were saying,
sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Give me counsel."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Pardon me, sire; but in the
first place, I have something to add."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Say - what?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "An evident, palpable,
material proof of treason."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And what is that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I have just learnt that M.
Fouquet is fortifying Belle-Isle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, indeed!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Are you sure?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Perfectly.  Do you know,
sire, what soldiers there are in Belle-Isle?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, <i>ma foi!</i>  Do
you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I am ignorant, likewise,
sire; I should therefore propose to your majesty to send somebody
to Belle-Isle?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Who?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Me, for instance."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And what would you do at
Belle-Isle?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Inform myself whether,
after the example of the ancient feudal lords, M. Fouquet was
battlementing his walls."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And with what purpose could
he do that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "With the purpose of
defending himself someday against his king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But, if it be thus, M.
Colbert," said Louis, "we must immediately do as you say; M.
Fouquet must be arrested."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is impossible."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I thought I had already
told you, monsieur, that I suppressed that word in my
service."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The service of your majesty
cannot prevent M. Fouquet from being
surintendant-g&eacute;n&eacute;ral."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That, in consequence of
holding that post, he has for him all the parliament, as he has
all the army by his largesses, literature by his favors, and the
<i>noblesse</i> by his presents."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is to say, then, that
I can do nothing against M. Fouquet?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Absolutely nothing, - at
least at present, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You are a sterile
counselor, M. Colbert."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh, no, sire; for I will
not confine myself to pointing out the peril to your
majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Come, then, where shall we
begin to undermine this Colossus; let us see;" and his majesty
began to laugh bitterly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "He has grown great by
money; kill him by money, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "If I were to deprive him of
his charge?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A bad means, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The good - the good,
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ruin him, sire, that is the
way."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But how?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Occasions will not be
wanting; take advantage of all occasions."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Point them out to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Here is one at once.  His
royal highness Monsieur is about to be married; his nuptials must
be magnificent.  That is a good occasion for your majesty to
demand a million of M. Fouquet.  M. Fouquet, who pays twenty
thousand livres down when he need not pay more than five
thousand, will easily find that million when your majesty demands
it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is all very well; I
<i>will</i> demand it," said Louis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "If your majesty will sign
the <i>ordonnance</i> I will have the money got together
myself."  And Colbert pushed a paper before the king, and
presented a pen to him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                At that moment the usher
opened the door and announced monsieur le surintendant.  Louis
turned pale.  Colbert let the pen fall, and drew back from the
king, over whom he extended his black wings like an evil spirit. 
The superintendent made his entrance like a man of the court, to
whom a single glance was sufficient to make him appreciate the
situation.  That situation was not very encouraging for Fouquet,
whatever might be his consciousness of strength.  The small black
eye of Colbert, dilated by envy, and the limpid eye of Louis XIV.
inflamed by anger, signalled some pressing danger.  Courtiers
are, with regard to court rumors, like old soldiers, who
distinguish through the blasts of wind and bluster of leaves the
sound of the distant steps of an armed troop.  They can, after
having listened, tell pretty nearly how many men are marching,
how many arms resound, how many cannons roll.  Fouquet had then
only to interrogate the silence which his arrival had produced;
he found it big with menacing revelations.  The king allowed him
time enough to advance as far as the middle of the chamber.  His
adolescent modesty commanded this forbearance of the moment. 
Fouquet boldly seized the opportunity.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire," said he, "I was
impatient to see your majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What for?" asked Louis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To announce some good news
to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Colbert, minus grandeur of
person, less largeness of heart, resembled Fouquet in many
points.  He had the same penetration, the same knowledge of men;
moreover, that great power of self-compression which gives to
hypocrites time to reflect, and gather themselves up to take a
spring.  He guessed that Fouquet was going to meet the blow he
was about to deal him.  His eyes glittered ominously.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What news?" asked the
king.  Fouquet placed a roll of papers on the table.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Let your majesty have the
goodness to cast your eyes over this work," said he.  The king
slowly unfolded the paper.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Plans?" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And what are these
plans?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A new fortification,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Ah, ah!" said the king,
"you amuse yourself with tactics and strategies then, M.
Fouquet?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I occupy myself with
everything that may be useful to the reign of your majesty,"
replied Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Beautiful descriptions!"
said the king, looking at the design.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your majesty comprehends,
without doubt," said Fouquet, bending over the paper; "here is
the circle of the walls, here are the forts, there the advanced
works."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And what do I see here,
monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The sea."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The sea all round?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And what is, then, the name
of this place of which you show me the plan?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, it is
Belle-&Icirc;le-en-Mer," replied Fouquet with simplicity.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                At this word, at this name,
Colbert made so marked a movement, that the king turned round to
enforce the necessity for reserve.  Fouquet did not appear to be
the least in the world concerned by the movement of Colbert, or
the king's signal.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," continued Louis,
"you have then fortified Belle-Isle?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, sire; and I have
brought the plan and the accounts to your majesty," replied
Fouquet; "I have expended sixteen hundred livres in this
operation."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "What to do?" replied Louis,
coldly, having taken the initiative from a malicious look of the
intendant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "For an aim very easy to
seize," replied Fouquet.  "Your majesty was on cool terms with
Great Britain."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes; but since the
restoration of King Charles II. I have formed an alliance with
him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A month since, sire, your
majesty has truly said; but it is more than six months since the
fortifications of Belle-Isle were begun."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then they have become
useless."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, fortifications are
never useless.  I fortified Belle-Isle against MM. Monk and
Lambert and all those London citizens who were playing at
soldiers.  Belle-Isle will be ready fortified against the Dutch,
against whom either England or your majesty cannot fail to make
war."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king was again silent,
and looked askant at Colbert.  "Belle-Isle, I believe," added
Louis, "is yours, M. Fouquet?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Whose then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your majesty's."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Colbert was seized with as
much terror as if a gulf had opened beneath his feet.  Louis
started with admiration, either at the genius or the devotion of
Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Explain yourself,
monsieur," said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Nothing more easy, sire;
Belle-Isle is one of my estates; I have fortified it at my own
expense.  But as nothing in the world can oppose a subject making
an humble present to his king, I offer your majesty the
proprietorship of the estate, of which you will leave me the
usufruct.  Belle-Isle, as a place of war, ought to be occupied by
the king.  Your majesty will be able, henceforth, to keep a safe
garrison there."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Colbert felt almost sinking
down upon the floor.  To keep himself from falling, he was
obliged to hold by the columns of the wainscoting.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "This is a piece of great
skill in the art of war that you have exhibited here, monsieur,"
said Louis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, the initiative did
not come from me," replied Fouquet; "many officers have inspired
me with it.  The plans themselves have been made by one of the
most distinguished engineers."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "His name?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "M. du Vallon."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "M. du Vallon?" resumed
Louis; "I do not know him.  It is much to be lamented, M.
Colbert," continued he, "that I do not know the names of the men
of talent who do honor to my reign."  And while saying these
words he turned towards Colbert.  The latter felt himself
crushed, the sweat flowed from his brow, no word presented itself
to his lips, he suffered an inexpressible martyrdom.  "You will
recollect that name," added Louis XIV.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Colbert bowed, but was paler
than his ruffles of Flemish lace.  Fouquet continued:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "The masonries are of Roman
concrete; the architects amalgamated it for me after the best
accounts of antiquity."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "And the cannon?" asked
Louis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! sire, that concerns
your majesty; it did not become me to place cannon in my own
house, unless your majesty had told me it was yours."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Louis began to float,
undetermined between the hatred which this so powerful man
inspired him with, and the pity he felt for the other, so cast
down, who seemed to him the counterfeit of the former.  But the
consciousness of his kingly duty prevailed over the feelings of
the man, and he stretched out his finger to the paper.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It must have cost you a
great deal of money to carry these plans into execution," said
he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I believe I had the honor
of telling your majesty the amount."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Repeat it if you please, I
have forgotten it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sixteen hundred thousand
livres."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sixteen hundred thousand
livres! you are enormously rich, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It is your majesty who is
rich, since Belle-Isle is yours."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Yes, thank you; but however
rich I may be, M. Fouquet - "  The king stopped.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, sire?" asked the
superintendent.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I foresee the moment when I
shall want money."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "You, sire?  And at what
moment then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "To-morrow, for
example."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Will your majesty do me the
honor to explain yourself?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "My brother is going to
marry the English Princess."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Well, I ought to give the
bride a reception worthy of the granddaughter of Henry IV."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is but just,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Then I shall want
money."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "No doubt."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I shall want - " Louis
hesitated.  The sum he was going to demand was the same that he
had been obliged to refuse Charles II.  He turned towards
Colbert, that he might give the blow.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "I shall want, to-morrow - "
repeated he, looking at Colbert.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "A million," said the
latter, bluntly; delighted to take his revenge.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Fouquet turned his back upon
the intendant to listen to the king.  He did not turn round, but
waited till the king repeated, or rather murmured, "A
million."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Oh! sire," replied Fouquet
disdainfully, "a million! what will your majesty do with a
million?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "It appears to me,
nevertheless - " said Louis XIV.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "That is not more than is
spent at the nuptials of one of the most petty princes of
Germany."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Your majesty must have two
millions at least.  The horses alone would run away with five
hundred thousand livres.  I shall have the honor of sending your
majesty sixteen hundred thousand livres this evening."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "How," said the king,
"sixteen hundred thousand livres?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Look, sire," replied
Fouquet, without even turning towards Colbert, "I know that wants
four hundred thousand livres of the two millions.  But this
monsieur of l'intendance" (pointing over his shoulder to Colbert,
who if possible, became paler, behind him) "has in his coffers
nine hundred thousand livres of mine."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                The king turned round to
look at Colbert.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But - " said the
latter.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Monsieur," continued
Fouquet, still speaking indirectly to Colbert, "monsieur has
received, a week ago, sixteen hundred thousand livres; he has
paid a hundred thousand livres to the guards, sixty-four thousand
livres to the hospitals, twenty-five thousand to the Swiss, an
hundred and thirty thousand for provisions, a thousand for arms,
ten thousand for accidental expenses; I do not err, then, in
reckoning upon nine hundred thousand livres that are left."  Then
turning towards Colbert, like a disdainful head of office towards
his inferior, "Take care, monsieur," said he, "that those nine
hundred thousand livres be remitted to his majesty this evening,
in gold."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "But," said the king, "that
will make two millions five hundred thousand livres."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "Sire, the five hundred
thousand livres over will serve as pocket money for his royal
highness.  You understand, Monsieur Colbert, this evening before
eight o'clock."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                And with these words, bowing
respectfully to the king, the superintendent made his exit
backwards, without honoring with a single look the envious man,
whose head he had just half shaved.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Colbert tore his ruffles to
pieces in his rage, and bit his lips till they bled.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                Fouquet had not passed the
door of the cabinet, when an usher pushing by him, exclaimed: "A
courier from Bretagne for his majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">                "M. d'Herblay was right,"
murmured Fouquet, pulling out his watch; "an hour and fifty-five
minutes.  It was quite true."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">               </p>
